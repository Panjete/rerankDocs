in trauma tissue damage activates the immune response with extensive tissue damage invoking systemic inflammation 6 15 16 alterations in local and systemic immune responses after severe trauma are recognized as a physiological reaction to restore homeostasis the magnitude of these immunological changes correlates with the degree of local and systemic tissue damage 6 19necrotic cells rapidly release alarmins damage associated molecular patterns damps which are endogenous molecules and are equivalent in function to pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps eg sars-cov-2 proteins as their name suggests alarmins alert the immune system and their ultimate function is to restore homeostasis by promoting regeneration of damaged tissue 6 16 20 21in trauma various relevant alarmins have been identified and characterized one such alarmin high mobility group box 1 hmgb1 has shown chemotactic effects on monocytes macrophages and neutrophils and is a very potent stimulator of immune cell maturation 22 in addition heat shock protein hsp interacts with several receptors including toll-like receptors and stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor tnf- and interleukin il-1 23 these cytokines are early regulators of the pro-inflammatory immune response to trauma and both of them induce the release of secondary cytokines such as il-6 and il-8 6 24 these cytokines which are predominantly produced by monocytes and macrophages mediate a variety of frequently overlapping effects and their actions can be additive 6 24 damps and cytokines further activate different immune cells including neutrophils and monocytes via damp-receptors 25the balance and interplay of these different endogenous molecules dictates the clinical course in trauma patients overexpression of either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators may induce organ dysfunction whereas a predominantly pro-inflammatory response leads to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs a predominantly anti-inflammatory reaction leads to the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome cars in the absence of inflammatory complications concurrent sirscars responses should be considered a physiological process and balance each other out however excessive sirs can result in immune overreaction while cars may lead to immune suppression or paralysis with a subsequent increased risk of infectious complications 6 16 20 21 interestingly in severe blunt trauma it has been demonstrated that the early immune response is consistent with simultaneously increased expression of both pro-inflammatory genes sirs-response and anti-inflammatory genes cars-response 26 together this response induces an increase in circulating cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm 27 moreover the development of systemic inflammatory complications such as organ failure are associated with the magnitude and duration of a genomically induced cytokine storm 20 21 24 26 27extrapulmonary inflammatory processes affect the pulmonary compartment via the circulatory uptake of these cytokines 6 28 one crucial step in the pathophysiology of distant organ damage is the adherence of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes to capillary endothelial cells 29 this is characterized by leukocyte diapedesis in organ tissue with subsequent release of oxygen radicals and proteases 30 these consequently damage the endothelial layer resulting in increased capillary permeability interstitial oedema and finally distant organ damage 6 9 16 30 further inflammatory activation causes local collateral damage to parenchymal cells and result in subsequent lung dysfunction 6 15 16 31 the collaboration of humoral immune factors and immune cells play an essential role in the transition from an appropriate to an overwhelming dysregulated immune response 6 15 16 31 32these pathophysiological inflammatory cascades result in significant changes in the anatomy mechanics and function of the lung 33 an initial increase in pulmonary capillary permeability stimulates alveolar flooding and oedema the consequence is the loss of surfactant function this causes atelectasis and subsequent alveolar instability resulting in repetitive alveolar collapse and expansion and finally impaired gas exchange with local and systemic hypoxia 32 33the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 infection and more specifically its considerable capacity to extensively disturb physiological homeostasis is currently unclear however based on recent clinical and experimental findings and related viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 sars-cov-1 basic understanding has rapidly increased the current sars-cov-2 virus as well as the sars-cov-1 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are related pathological human coronaviruses covs 3436 phylogenetic studies show an 80 nucleotide identity of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov-1 and the pathophysiological insights made for sars-cov-1 can likely be applied to sars-cov-2 37 38in line with sars-cov-1 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a type i membrane protein is considered the host cell surface-receptor for the sars-cov-2 spike receptors 39 40 kuba et al demonstrated the key role of ace2-receptors in sars-cov-1 pathology by showing that ace2-ko mice were unsusceptible to sars-cov exposure 41 distribution of the ace2-receptor is tissue specific and varying degrees of receptor expression are seen in lungs type i and type ii alveolar epithelial cells as well as bronchiolar epithelial cells heart kidneys and the gastro-intestinal tract 42 43 tissue specific ace2-receptor distribution patterns may affect disease progression and make specific organs more susceptible this is supported by histopathological studies of sars-cov fatalities showing most prominent tissue damage in the respiratory system with less extensive damage to liver kidney cardiac and digestive tract tissues 44 45ace2 plays an important physiological role in regulating blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas it is therefore tempting to hypothesize that there is an interplay between clinical observations linking hypertension with impaired outcome in sars-cov-2 infection 46 47 upon viral cell invasion however the process leading to end-organ parenchymal cell destruction and finally resulting in life threatening complications such as ards and mods remain unclear sars-cov-1 mice models demonstrated the relevance of ace2-expression and suggests that sars-cov may directly derange ace2-lung protective pathways 48in addition to these direct pathophysiological processes of sars it is likely that other indirect processes also play a critical role in the rapid progression of severe covid-19 the sars-cov-1 epidemic emphasized this with the observation that disease progression into critical stages was commonly associated with diminishing viral titers 34 49 studies on the association between viral load and covid-19 disease severity however are scarce and have so far demonstrated conflicting results 50 51 post-mortem observations in sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 are characterized by alveolar exudative inflammation interstitial inflammation alveolar epithelial proliferation and hyaline membrane formation thereby demonstrating ards-like lesions 4 5 5254from an immunological perspective a prominent neutrophil and macrophage presence was observed in the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli in sars-cov-1 fatalities 54 the aberrant systemic cellular immune response of fatal sars-cov-1-cases was characterized by both an increase in circulating monocytes and neutrophils and a reduction in circulating lymphocytes 55 56in sars-cov-2 lymphopenia is common 4 12 and both circulatory lymphopenia and leukocytosis are associated with covid-19 mortality 10 in contrast with mild cases of covid-19 a reduction of circulatory cd4 and cd8 cells was observed in severe covid-19 infection 57 58in addition to an altered cellular immune response in fatal sars-cov-12 infections transient humoral dysregulation has also been described whereas minimal cytokine level alterations are seen in mild covid-19 infection 57 severe infections have shown elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf-alpha il-6 il-10 58although experimental clinical data on covid-19 infection is scarce the presence of an aberrant humoral immune response is further suggested by significantly increased serum il-6 levels found in covid-19 fatalities 59 60 moreover a cytokine storm indicative of widespread immune activation similar to that found in posttraumatic ards has also been observed in sars-cov-2 infection 26 5961based on these findings it is tempting to hypothesize that rather than direct cytotoxic effects of virus-infected cells alone severe sars-cov-2 infection triggers both the humoral and cellular immune system consequent life-threatening complications therefore primarily relate to an aberrant immune response a similar aberrant immune response after severe trauma has been well established the pathophysiological mechanisms observed in trauma may be universal and are therefore likely also involved in covid-19 disease progression insights in the pathophysiology of severe trauma may therefore form the basis for novel therapeutic concepts for sars-cov-2 and we propose the pathophysiological model of covid-19 disease progression as being displayed as fig 1
this figure summarizes the process of ongoing inflammation starting from insult viral infection into the development of end-organ inflammation and dysfunction the initial insult evokes a local systemic response including involvement of natural killer celldendritic cells lymphocytes neutrophils and macrophages adequate responses result in viral clearance and in the case of contained local infection minimal collateral damage to parenchymal organ cells and consequent recovery however in case the immune response is unable to stop ongoing viral replication disease progression may occur based on the pathophysiological concepts in sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and trauma summarized above it is tempting to hypothesize that covid-19 disease progression is based on two primary mechanistic pathways these pathways are a direct pamp-driven pathway and an indirect damp-driven pathway either of which can lead to covid-19 disease progression
ia direct pamp-driven pathway this is characterized by increased local spread of the virus and eventually dissemination of viral infection dependent on tissue-specific ace2-receptor expression levels and likely correlating with increased viral load vital organ involvement may occur even in the absence of initial systemic inflammation leading to multiple organ dysfunctioniian indirect damp-driven pathway upon contained local inflammation a secondary massive immune response may be initiated including a cytokine storm large-scale innate immune cell activation and sirscars-responses these processes lead to extensive systemic inflammation and subsequent altered homeostasis of vital organs finally organ failure may occur due to inflammation-induced collateral damage in end-organs progression according to this pathway is independent of viral loadthese are not mutually exclusive pathways and interplay between these may potentially play a role in the progression of covid-19 at all phases of both pathways improvement and restoration of homeostasis is possible and will lead to recovery in traumatology the term first hit is used to describe the initial insult condition or trauma the patient faces the intensity of the first hit is based on the trauma load the degree of initial tissue damage including organ injury fractures burn injury soft tissue injury and hypovolemic shock consequently local and systemic release of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is dependent on the severity of the first hit of the trauma itself 62 these insults determine the initial trauma load and result in activation of the innate and adaptive immune system that stimulate the local and systemic inflammatory reactions moreover genetic predisposition seems to affect the immune response as well 6 the subsequent activation of immune cells polymorphonuclear granulocytes monocytes and lymphocytes trigger multifocal processes leading to tissue regeneration and repair excessive tissue damage however may magnify the extent of local and systemic activation leading to organ dysfunction whereas a predominantly pro-inflammatory response leads to an excessive sirs-response a predominantly anti-inflammatory reaction may result in an intensified cars-response and with subsequent immunoparalysis and a consequent increased risk of infectious complications 6 15 16similarly with covid-19 the first hit is the initial viral infection itself centred primarily on respiratory tissue the magnitude of the first hit is associated with predisposing factors eg sex expression of ace2 receptors and viral load existing comorbidities may also affect the severity of the initial insult and determine the overall impact of the first hit on homeostasis patients with diabetes cardiovascular disease hypertension and lung disease are especially prone to decompensation in sars-cov-2 infection 4 12in trauma cases the secondary activation of various molecular cascades due to an additional insult are known as second hit- phenomena this secondary immune cell activation or priming is stimulated by a variety of triggers 6 15 16 31 these triggers may be iatrogenic eg mechanical ventilation 63 surgical intervention 20 21 transfusions or non-iatrogenic eg secondary infection 64 thromboembolic complications 65 ischemiareperfusion injury 66 each insult further catalyses the immune response and depending on severity may cause an excessive inflammatory response this process initiates a vicious cycle of local tissue damage additionally aggravated by systemic hyperactivation ultimately leading to a life-threatening overwhelming immune responsesimilarly in severe covid-19 infection secondary insults or complications may stimulate an exaggerated immune response amplify systemic inflammation or at a later stage induce immune paralysis respiratory distress and systemic hypoxemia may stimulate further tissue injury and abruptly require intensive care and monitoring in addition metabolic decompensation and systemic hypoperfusion are further risk factors associated with remote tissue damage secondary pulmonary bacterial infections or catheter-associated infections are further potential second hit events all of which are capable of aggravating the clinical course of the disease figure 2 displays our proposed model of consecutive insults and systemic inflammatory disease progression in covid-19 based on established trauma models like trauma viral infection causes rapid activation of the immune system in case the first hit insult is potent enough systemic inflammation occurs upon initiation of systemic inflammation both a systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs and a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome cars are evoked the green curves in fig 2 represent uncomplicated courses and lead to recovery in these courses the inflammatory response is considered a physiological process
in some patients however immune dysregulation occurs excessive immune activation hyperactivation red curves in fig 2 may occur and collateral damage to parenchymal cells of vital organs may lead to organ failure or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods alternatively patients may develop inflammatory complications due to immune paralysis as a result of cars a refractory state of the immune system is incapable of resolving the sars-cov-2 infection and are more susceptible to novel pathogens complications develop when either the primary viral or secondary microbial infection cannot be resolved eventually infection-related mods may occur blue curves in fig 2 in both cases additional hits may push a patient from a physiological immune response to either a pathological hyperinflammatory immune response or a pathological hypo-inflammatory immune responsenumerous fast-tracked clinical trials to treat covid-19 infections have recently been initiated many therapeutic strategies focus primarily on inhibiting the virus or bolstering the immune system these strategies are aimed at treating the direct pamp-driven pathophysiological pathway thereby supporting the immune responsebased on experience treating ards in trauma trying to do more may in fact be less the majority of these experimental treatments may be focusing on the wrong enemy the virus instead of the hosts uncontrolled immune response alternatively as in trauma anti-inflammatory interventions to modulate the hyperactive immune response in covid-19 may be promising most modern treatment modalities for trauma are aimed at the indirect damp-driven pathway and to dampen second hit events applying these concepts to covid-19 treatment the following measures complementary to current treatment guidelines for covid-19 disease should be considered
postponing all elective non-essential surgical interventions in endemic areas this has already been adopted by many clinicians treating covid-19 and should be universally adopted furthermore execution of invasive diagnostic procedures and interventions should be limited to live-saving interventions onlylung-protective ventilation protocols to prevent a barotrauma second hit 67 mechanical ventilation when improperly used can exacerbate lung damage by causing secondary ventilatory induced lung injury vili vili can be significantly reduced with proper positive end-expiratory pressure peep levels to minimize atelectasis 67 moreover lowering tidal volume vt and plateau pressure pplat may prevent lung over-distension alveolar strain can be decreased by reducing the transpulmonary pressure ptp gradient 68sufficient thrombosis prophylaxis to prevent thromboembolic second hits in cases where medicinal prophylaxis is contraindicated mechanical measures including compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression should be considered further several studies have described a close link between thrombogenesis and inflammation proinflammatory cytokines eg il-6 stimulate the expression of prothrombotic mediators dampening the proinflammatory immune response may further minimize the risk of thromboembolic complications 69 increased serum d-dimer levels in severe cases of covid-19 and the frequent occurrence of embolic complications underline the relevance of impaired thromboembolic homeostasis in the specific case of covid-19 70transfusion of blood products should be minimized to avoid transfusion induced immune activation and more specifically transfusion-related acute injury trali-like conditions 71prevent and treat secondary infections adequately to prevent additional infectious insults and inflammatory exaggeration we suggest actively searching for secondary infections by serial clinical examination and routine laboratory analysis of infection parameters additionally catheter associated infections can be minimized with regular renewal schedules of catheters 72table 1 provides an overview of standard measures used to optimize care of critically ill trauma patients that can be applied to severe sars-cov-2 infections as a next step experimental immunomodulatory therapies aimed to optimize outcomes of trauma induced inflammatory complications may be considered for the treatment of sars-cov-2 potential therapies include tissue plasminogen activator tpa 73 the anti-inflammatory effects of tranexamic acid 74 and extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy 75
this review attempts to draw analogies to pathophysiological and therapeutic principles between severely injured trauma patients and covid-19 many similarities between both conditions have been identified supporting the hypothesis that treatment concepts for ards in trauma may potentially be of use in the management of covid-19 two complementary pathways of disease progression into severe covid-19 have been identified and described based on established pathophysiological concepts in the field of trauma we strongly suggest postponing all elective surgery in endemic areas immunoprotective protocols such as lung protective ventilation adequate thrombosis prophylaxis prevention of secondary infection and calculated antibiotic therapies used to minimize inflammatory complications in trauma patients are likely beneficial in the management of sars-cov-2 infections and should be universally applied whenever possible finally experimental immunomodulatory interventions currently being investigated in the setting of severe trauma may play a role in the management of covid-19 patients and should be investigatedthe covid-19 now named sars-cov2 spreading in wuhan china and now spread globally rapidly 1 it is reported that covid-19 has the same viral genome above 85 identity in the genome and pathophysiology mechanisms with the sars-cov 2 the covid-19 infection affecting all age-groups but it appears to be more severe in elderly adults 3 it seems that very high pro-inflammatory cytokine release which is described as cytokine storm is a pivotal pathophysiological mechanism in elderly covid-19 patients 4 aging is related to increased levels of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased levels of systemic anti-inflammatory cytokines hence a chronic condition of inflammation may be created in aged subjects known as inflamm-aging 5 6 ample studies have indicated elevated levels of interleukin il-6 il-1 tumor necrosis factor- tnf  as well as c-reactive protein crp in aged subjects 7 8 although the exact underlying mechanism of cytokine storm in elderly adults with severe covid-19 infection is far from clear however it is likely that dysregulation of the cytokine homeostasis in inflame-aging phenomenon may play a critical role in the risk of a cytokine storm and subsequently acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in some elderly patients with severe covid-19 infection it seems that cytokine storm phenomenon in elderly patients with severe covid-19 infection is associated with many age-related pathophysiologic processes including alteration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor expression 9 excess ros production 10 alteration of autophagy 11 the inflammatory phenotype of senescent cell activity particularly adipose tissue 12 and immune-senescence 13 as well as lack of vitamin d content 14 here we are going to review and discuss all above mentioned age-related pathophysiological pathways that appear to contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine networks and possibly a cytokine storm in elderly patients with severe covid-19 infectionit has been shown that covid-19 infection has distinctive behavior among elderly adults severe infection as compared with children and young adults none or mild infection indeed covid-19 infection can induce severe infection including pneumonia and ards in some elderly adults or sick patients and not in children or young adults 15 what is the reason that the deadly cases of covid-19 mainly seen in elderly patients here first we are going to review and compare the possible pathophysiology mechanisms of mild infection and severe infection in young and elderly adults with covid-19 respectivelydespite increasing evidences on the immune response to pathogens however less is known about the exact immunologic mechanism of covid-19 infections as shown in fig 1 initiation of the immune response against invading coronavirus begins with a direct infection of the bronchi and bronchiole epithelium first antigen-independent innate immunity provides the first line of leukocytes defense against microorganisms innate immune defense involves several cell types including leukocytes such as neutrophils eosinophils basophils monocytes macrophages lung epithelial cells mast cells natural killer nk cells 16 following initial covid-19 infection lung-resident dendritic cells dcs become activated and change to antigen-presenting cells apcs indeed apcs are the first line of defense in recognizing various pathogens in the lung dcs resides in and below the airway epithelium the alveolar septa pulmonary capillaries and airway spaces 17 activated apcs ingests and processes an antigen and migrate to the lymph nodes then in the lymph nodes apc presents the antigen in the form of mhcpeptide complex to nave circulating t helper cells th0 inducing the immune response 18 following activation of th0 receptor by mhcpeptide complex t helper cells become activated proliferate and differentiated to cd4 t helper lymphocytes and cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes cells then cd4 th lymphocytes further differentiated into th1 and th2 with different cytokine profiles 19 th1 cells drive cellular immunity and released pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn- il-1 il-12 and tnf- 17 it is reported that cytokine ifn- can inhibit viral replication and enhance antigen presentation 20 th2 cells activated humoral immunity and antibody production and released anti-inflammatory cytokines such as tgf- il-4 il-5 il-9 il-10 and il-13 21 in fact a balanced between th1 and th2 lymphocyte activity is observed in healthy adults with covid-19 infection furthermore cd8 t lymphocytes cytotoxic t cells as cytotoxic cells secrete cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme b that kill infected epithelial cells indeed cd8 t lymphocytes and natural killer cells nk play a critical contribution in viral clearance 17 both t and b cell responses against covid-19 observed in the systemic blood pool 1 week after the initiation of covid-19 symptoms the autopsy of a patient with covid-19 identified an accumulation of mononuclear cells likely monocytes and t cells in the lungs with low levels of hyperactive t cells in the peripheral blood these findings suggested that likely t cells are attracted away from the systemic blood pool and into the infected site lung to control the covid-19 infection 21 generally activation of different th cells and release of ample cytokines and chemokines recruit more innate cell-mediated and humoral immunologic responses to control covid-19 in adults additionally it seems that the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses in the healthy adult can shut down immune activity at the right moment 22the renin-angiotensin system ras is an important regulator of several physiologic events including cardiovascular and blood volume natriuresis diabetes chronic renal disease and hepatic fibrosis 37 38 this system is composed of two different pathways including angiotensin-converting enzyme aceangiotensin ii ang iiangiotensin receptor type 1 at1 aceang iiat1 pathway and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2ang 17mas receptor ace2ang 17mas pathway these two pathways have opposing effects to accommodate a coordinated response to specific triggers the activity of aceang iiat1 pathway related to tissue injury inflammation and fibrosis 39 in contrast the activity of the ace2ang 17mas pathway exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects 39 40 ace2 degrades ang ii as a major substrate for ace2 and generates ang-17 38 recently it is well accepted that ace2 on lung epithelial cells are the entry-point receptors for covid-19 particles 41 it is demonstrated that the highest expression of ace2 is in the lungs type ii alveolar epithelial cells kidney heart and also vascular beds 37 yu and colleagues in 2018 revealed that ace2ang-17mas pathway markedly suppressed in pancreatitis by inhibition of the p38 mapknf-b signaling pathway 38 fu and colleagues in 2017 transfected ace2 plasmid in primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelium cells hrpe followed by stimulation with amyloid- a they observed that overexpression of ace2 markedly decreased a-induced inflammatory response by activating the ace2ang-17mas pathway in hrpe 42 in the respiratory syncytial virus ace2 protected against severe lung injury both in children and an experimental mouse model in addition in the ards model ace2 knockout mice displayed more severe symptoms of respiratory shut down compared with wild-type mice 43 indeed treatment strategy using ace2 analogs or vector containing ace2 result in beneficial effects in diabetic nephropathy hypertension cardiac disease 37 specific inhibitors of at1 receptors losartan have been shown to be effective in animal models of septic shock therefore the above mentioned studies suggested that ace2 pathway has anti-inflammatory effects several studies identified age-related decline of ace2 expression 40 44 45 for example in the study of xudong and colleagues in 2006 revealed age-related difference of ace2 expression revealed in rat lung they observed ace2 expression is significantly reduced with aging they are suggesting the more elevated ace2 in young adults as compared to age groups may contribute to the predominance in sars attacks in this age group 44 using gtex gene expression data and analysis chen and colleagues in 2020 found markedly higher expression of ace2 in asian females compared to males furthermore they found an age-dependent decline of ace2 expression and also a highly significant decrease in type ii diabetic patients additionally they established a negative correlation between ace2 expression and covid-19 fatality interestingly in severe cases many vital tissues including those with little ace2 expressed are severely damaged by covid-19 infection 45 these evidences may partially suggest that the increase concentration of ace2 receptors in lung epithelial cells in children and young adults may have a protective effect on severe clinical manifestations due to covid-19 infection therefore it is highly likely that low ace2 expression and unbalance ang iiang17 level during aging can lead to cytokine storm and lung shut down 40 41 however the genetic basis of ace2 expression and its function in different individuals is still far from clear 46it is well accepted that ros considered as a signaling molecule at low concentrations and also as a mediator of inflammation at high concentrations 47 the main sources of ros are mitochondrial respiratory chain and nadph oxidase 48 garrido and colleagues in 2019 identified that the immune cells of pre-maturely aging mice presented lower values of antioxidant defenses and higher values of ros and pro-inflammatory cytokines 10 hence it is suggested that excess ros production during aging can turn on an inflammatory machine and subsequently increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf- il-1 il-2 and il-6 and adhesion molecules the excess ros production in aging can initiate the pro-inflammatory generation through activation of multiple transcription factors including human polynucleotide phosphorylase hpnpaseold-35 nuclear factor kappa b nf-b activator protein 1 ap-1 specificity protein 1 sp1 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ppars 49 50 for example it is reported that hpnpaseold-35 which is up-regulated during senescence may promote the activation of nf-b pathway and initiates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and il-8 51 furthermore the expression of hpnpaseold-35 itself induces ros production this suggests that hpnpaseold-35 could be an upstream signaling molecule that increased ros generation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokines during aging in addition to hpnpaseold-35 nf-b is also an important transcription factor that up-regulated during aging by excess ros production in resting states an inhibitory protein ikb inactivated nf-b in the cytoplasm however ros production can phosphorylate inhibitory ikb proteins leading to nuclear translocation of nf-b and regulation of gene transcription then activated nf-b can initiate the secretion and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf-a il-1 il-6 il-8 ifn-g inos cox-2 50 interestingly as the excess ros production can increase pro-inflammatory cytokines the pro-inflammatory cytokines can also increase ros production 52 for instance it has been identified that the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 can increase ros generation by increased expression of nadph oxidase-4 in lung cancer 53 additionally it has been demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon- and the pro-inflammatory component of the bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide can synergistically increase ros generation in human pancreatitis by nf-b-dependent expression of duox2 a member of the nadph oxidase family 54 hence excess ros production and inflammation are closely related which are taking part in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and inflame-aging in elderly adultsautophagy is a conserved catabolic turnover pathway in eukaryotic cells by which cellular material delivered into the lysosomes for degradation autophagy process is related to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and its dysregulation could lead to the development of several aging-related pathophysiological diseases 11 it has been shown that the autophagy process decrease during aging leads to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules and organelles the decline of autophagy during aging can induce dysfunctional mitochondria and subsequent increased ros production 55 mitochondria are the major source of ros in this context two major processes are for protection from harmful effects of ros including mitophagy and antioxidant capacity in one hand mitophagy which is characterized by autophagic degradation of mitochondria decreased with aging 56 on the other hand decreased mitophagy together with decreased antioxidant capacity during aging can increased ros levels in the body the excess production of ros in stress condition leading to memory deficits anxiety-like behavior and increase pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion during aging 5760 although the exact underlying mechanism of how the decline in autophagy and a rise in ros levels during aging can elevate pro-inflammatory cytokine release is far from clear however it is well accepted that low activity of autophagy process and high level of ros production during aging can activate and up-regulate nod-like receptors nlrs 54 the nlrs are a type of intracellular pattern-recognition receptors prrs for pathogen recognition they monitor both inflammation and apoptosis signaling pathways these receptors expressed in many cell types including immune cells lymphocytes macrophages dendritic cells and even epithelial cells 61 it is observed that activation of cytosolic nlrs increased during aging and in many age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus for example from ebersole and colleagues study in 2017 identified that expression of nlrs increased with aging in the healthy oral mucosa 62 additionally luan and colleagues in 2018 found that nlrp3 expression increased in concanavalin a-induced hepatitis as a model of autoimmune hepatitis 63 salminen and colleagues in 2012 reported that the decrease of autophagic capacity during aging generates the inflammatory situation by means the activation of pro-inflammatory factors in particular nlrp3 55 it is accepted that nlrs activity can increase expression of caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 and il-18 leading to cell death fig 3 for example nadatani in 2016 reported that caspase-1 can induce pyroptosis a unique form of programmed cell death through the conversion of pro-il1 and pro-il18 in their active forms which promotes further inflammation in pyroptosis the dying cells release their cytoplasmic pro-inflammatory contents into the extracellular fluid 64 similarly wangs and colleagues revealed that treatment of ac-yvad-cmk an inhibitor of nlrp3-caspase-1 suppressed isoflurane-induced microglial inflammatory response in aged mice 65 this finding is a critical study for supporting that nlrp3caspase-1 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory disease in elderly adults fig 3 furthermore stranks in 2015 found that macrophages from aged mice exhibit markedly reduced autophagic flux as compared to young mice they also reported that reduced autophagy during aging increased macrophage populations and their phagocytosis function decreased surface antigen expression while the increased the inflammatory cytokine response 66 additionally in animal model studies increase autophagy by means caloric restriction and also exercise result in down-regulation of il-1 production and improve the aging-related pro-inflammatory profile so it seems that crosstalk between the decline of mitophagy pathways and elevated ros level during aging can imbalance immune system activity of elderly adults 67senescent cells accumulate with aging in many animal and human tissues leading to chronic inflammation and organ dysfunction 68 senescent cells have lower cell viability as well as insufficient protection against oxidative stress 69 additionally senescent cells can release pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-1 il-6 il-8 il-18 ccl-2 tnf- granulocyte macrophages colony-stimulating factor gm-csf growth regulated oncogene gro monocyte chemotactic protein mcp-2 mcp-3 mmp-1 mmp-3 70 71 so the immune effector is not the main source of inflammatory markers aging studies revealed the importance of adipose tissue inflammation in aged animals by the elevated release of interleukin 6 il-8 il-1 as well as tnf- 6870 adipose tissue is a dynamic structure that plays an important contribution in modulating of metabolism and inflammation it is highly likely that adipose tissue dysfunction for instance obesity during aging is associated with chronic inflammation in aged subjects 12 petrakis and colleagues in 2020 reported that age-related obesity leading to increased susceptibility of more serious complications of covid-19 as compared to younger individuals in obese covid-19 patients the adipose tissue interacts with the immune system and increased the lethality of the infection by fat tissue-associated cytokines adipokines release adipocytes released amyloid-a an adipokine which act directly on macrophages and increased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines the mortality rate for young adults with covid-19 with normal body mass index was approximately 2 however the mortality rate for obese elderly adults with covid-19 was approximately 14 72 in addition to obesity covarrubias and colleagues found that during aging senescent cells significantly accumulate in visceral white adipose tissue and inflammatory cytokines found in the supernatant from senescent cells which are induced macrophages to proliferate and to express cd38 as a t cell activation marker 73 alicka and colleagues in 2020 found that adipose-derived stem cells from older groups exhibited increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory gene and mirnas such as il-8 il-1 tnf- mir-203b-5p and mir-16-5p and apoptosis markers such as p21 p53 caspase-3 caspase-9 69 ghosh and colleagues in 2016 reported that decreased autophagy activity during aging associated with increased adipose tissue er stress and inflammation in old adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction cells svfs in mice they also revealed that accumulation of autophagy substrates lc3-ii and p62 increased in old svfs implicated impaired autophagy activity furthermore they reported that old svfs had reduced expression of autophagy markers they also analyzed that decreased autophagy activity in old svfs is correlated with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 and mcp-1 74 therefore the elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by senescence adipocytes possibly leads to the elevated risk of the cytokine storm in covid-19 infection in poor prognosis patientswith progressive age the function of the innate and adaptive immune system undergoes physiological and morphological alteration throughout a lifetime which is characterized as an immune-senescence 13 75 indeed immune-senescence is described as the progressive loss of all immune effectors in both the innate and cell-mediated immune systems with aging 76 a normal and physiologic immunity depends on effective cross-talk between innate and adaptive immune systems so senescent immune effectors markedly impact on the health of elderly individuals 75 here we are going to briefly report age-related alteration of both innate and adaptive immune cells macrophages are central effector cells of the innate immune system and have many physiological functions 77 macrophage can produce several pro- tnf il-1 and il-6 and anti-inflammatory il-10 tgf acute phase proteins and glucocorticoids molecules enzymes growth factors nitric oxide toxic reactive radicals metalloproteinases and inhibitors of metalloproteinases as the clearance of pathogens proceeds the anti-inflammatory effectors of macrophages turn off macrophage inflammatory activities 78 therefore during a pathogen-induced inflammatory episode the balance of macrophage modulating secretion present in the tissues during aging the generation of several macrophage-induced factors is reduced including fibroblast growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor epithelial growth factor tgf toxic free radicals and expression of nitric oxide synthase additionally phagocytic and chemotactic activity of macrophages also decreased by a decline in production of macrophage-specific chemokines including macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 and mip-2 with advanced age macrophages can also display antigen-presenting activity by expressing major histocompatibility class mhc leading to a cross-talk between innate and cell-mediated immune system it is reported that with progressive age the expression of mhc-ii decreased in both mice and humans 79 80 natural killer nk cells are another cytotoxic effector of the innate immune system and involved in the early and fast faster than t cells defense against virus infection and other challengers 81 the nk cells such as macrophages linking innate and cell-mediated immune system nk cells regulate immune function by the generation and release of various cytokines 82 an increase in numbers of circulating nk cells reported during aging 75 one of the important cytokines for cytotoxic activity of nk cells is il-2 which increases killing properties and proliferation of nk cells in a healthy young individual il-2 can induce ifn secretion by nk cells but this effect decreased in elderly 83 furthermore aging can change the nk cells phenotypes which are an increase in cd56dim cells and a decrease in cd56bright cells in addition aging can increase the expression of the immune-senescence marker cd57 on nk cell populations 84 dendritic cells dcs are another component of the innate immune system and have a critical role in both immunity and tolerance the resident dcs are immature but the capture of pathogens converts them to mature form known as antigen-presentation cells apcs through up-regulation of mhc expression then mature apcs monitor th1 and th2 function in contrast immature dcs induce tolerance to self-antigens 25 in physiological condition dcs take up self- antigen and apoptotic cells and transport them to the lymph nodes 85 but during migration for the presentation of pathogens to th0 cells they undergo several phenotype alterations including up-regulation of mhc class i and ii molecules and down-regulation of adhesion molecules 86 furthermore dcs can generate and release various cytokines so they can modulate inflammatory responses 87 it is reported that increased age-related pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce activation and maturation of dcs panda and colleagues in 2010 identified an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines released from dcs in elderly adults 88 moreover the activity of dcs in elderly adults was higher than young individuals 89 ageing is also accompanied by profound and consistent alterations of t-cell immunity 90 although t-cell numbers do not diminish during aging however the t-cell pool exhibit potent age-related alterations including poor t-cell mitogen responses an inverted cd4cd8 t-cell ratio reduced proportion of naive cells as well as an increased proportion of memory cells in older animals and human 91 additionally aging is related to the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by t cells leading to immune pathology 92 the cd8cd28 subset of cells in the expanded memory cell population has shortened telomeres suggesting that they have a longer reflective history 93 in humans almost all t cells express cd28 at birth and the proportion of cd28 declines by the age 81 93 the increase in these cells has been observed consistently and is used as a prognostic indicator of immune-senescence in older populations 94 it is demonstrated that aging also changes the cytokine profile of th2 cells il-4 and il-10 rather than th1 type il-2 ifn-g leading to mild age-related inflammation in elderly adults aging can also potentially affect other th cells pool the ratio of th17 cells tregulatory cells increased during aging leading to a basal inflammatory state in elderly adults 95 th17 cells have the pro-inflammatory phenotype and they are in balance with tregulatory anti-inflammatory cells these cells are derived from a common precursor th0 96 tregulatory cells are a subset characterized by a high expression of cd25 and foxp3 a transcriptional factor for the function and differentiation of tregulatory cells 97 in addition to anti-inflammatory effects of tregulatory cells also recognize self-antigens 98 furthermore ageing is correlated with disruption of lymphocyte telomerase up-regulation 99 it is accepted that shortened lymphocyte telomeres are associated with a variety of age-associated pathologies 100 furthermore during aging nave t-cells show multiple alterations including the shortening of telomeres the reduced production of il-2 and the diminished ability to differentiate themselves into effector-cells the loss in the number and function of the nave t-cells with increasing of t cd8 cd45ro cd25 clones in aged subjects 101 cd28-cells are responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are resistant to apoptosis it is proposed that they are undergoing cells to senescence due to the shortening of telomeres and reduction of the proliferative capacity 102 interestingly pro-inflammatory cytokines have been also implicated in these age-associated alterations of t-cell immune-senescence indeed inflammatory conditions in elderly adults lead to alterations in t-cell immunity for instance age-related increased cytokine tnf is a potent stimulator of tcd4 cell senescence and t-cell differentiation 90 humoral immunity mediated by b lymphocytes has a critical role in the modulation of adaptive immunity responses b lymphocytes produce different types of antibodies for eliminating of challengers additionally b lymphocytes have an important role in the immune system through the presentation of antigens and secretion of cytokines 103 b lymphocytes arising from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow as pro-b lymphocytes then they differentiate into pre-b and then b lymphocytes 104 ample studies identified that aging is accompanied by quantitative and qualitative alteration of b lymphocyte pool 105 the number of b lymphocytes and the levels of serum immunoglobulin and antibody analyzed during the aging the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow from aged mice are less effective at generating both b lymphocytes as compared to young mice the number and the size of the germinal centers of b lymphocytes also decreased with aging production of precursor b lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the number of pro-b and pre-b lymphocytes decreased in aged mice and human 104 it has been shown that aged pro-b lymphocytes have
an impaired ability to respond to il-7 also both human nave and igm memory b lymphocytes impaired during aging 106 the percentage of igm memory b lymphocytes are not markedly decreased however the total numbers of b lymphocytes decreased additionally the antibody level is decreased in the aged subjects in addition the affinity and protective ability of antibodies in aged mice decreased as compared to the young mice 75 107 it is also reported that the immune response to influenza in old mice has less igg level than in young mice also young mice had mostly igg1 plasma level with high-affinity antibody in contrast aged mice mostly had igm plasma cells 108 hence antigen-specific antibody responses decline in old mice the decreased function of b lymphocytes such as antigen-specific antibody response and antibody affinity during aging has been attributed to lack of th function because the function of b lymphocytes is t-dependent 97 109 taken together immune-senescence alterations cannot properly fit cell-mediating and humeral immune response in elderly adults the immune system appears to maintain a mild inflammatory state in elderly adult therefore it is suggested that fragile and mildly over-active immune system in elderly adults cannot turn off the pro-inflammatory machine in covid-19 infection clinical findings in severe patients with covid-19 infection are in consistent with the above mention literature several manifestations including lymphopenia reduced numbers of cd4 t cells cd8 t cells b cells and natural killer nk cells monocytes eosinophils and basophils reported in severe patients with covid-19 infection 25 schouten and colleagues in 2019 identified that increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines during aging also correlated with the severity of ards and may partially explain age-dependent difference 110vd together with vitamin d receptor vdr has both classical functions such as bone and calcium-phosphorus homeostasis and non-classical function such as anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory function 111 112 vdr is expressed by several types of immune cells including monocytes macrophages b and t lymphocytes as well as dcs 113 additionally the -1-hydroxilase enzyme which converts inactive metabolite of vd 25oh d3 to the active form 125oh2d3 is expressed by the majority of immune cells such as macrophages 112 liu and colleagues in 2014 reported that the expression of vdr and -1-hydroxylase increased in macrophages following exposure to a pathogen 114 this finding suggested that the intracrine immune-regulatory function of vd as shown in fig 4 vd can decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as tnf- il-6 monocyte chemotatic protein1 mcp-1 and il-12 in immune cells through suppressing excessive ros production increasing intracellular glutathione levels suppressing nf-b and p38 map kinase expression excess ros production can increase nf-kb expression in immune cells leading to excess secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf-a il-1 il-6 il-8 ifn-g inos cox-2 50 activation of p38 map kinase pathway can also increase il-6 and mcp-1 generation in immune cells by stimulation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription15 stat15 115 it seems that pathogen challengers turn macrophages on by stimulation of pprs such as tlr21or nlrs activation of tlrs or nlr can increase intracellular vdr and -1-hydroxylase expression then a complex of vd and vdr together can decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the autophagy activity of macrophages and antimicrobial product generation including cathelicidin and -defensin in macrophages 116 in addition of immune regulatory effects of vd on macrophages it can also suppress the differentiation and migration of human dcs and decrease the expression of mhcii on dcs which are characterized as the tolerogenic properties 114 117 tolerogenic dcs can increase the number of il-10 producing cd4 t-cells and tregulatory cells elevated circulating cd4 tregulatory have of anti-inflammatory functions and also attenuated the inflammatory response of t-effector cells these tolerogenic actions of dcs are mediated by increased expression of foxp3 transcription factor 118 furthermore vd can also make a complex with vdr on the t lymphocytes leading to suppression of its proliferation hoe and colleagues in 2016 reported that vd markedly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf- ifn- and il-1 il-8 ifn- in response to bacterial ligands exposure vd also increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 119 hence vd can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses elderly adults are at risk for vd deficiency due to several factors including decreased pre-vd production poor skin integrity decreased dietary intake of vd increasing adiposity obesity decreased renal function as well as less time spent outdoors 120 vd deficiency has been linked to various aging-related inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis asthma inflammatory bowel disease multiple sclerosis cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes mellitus and cancer 121 additionally there is a correlation between vd deficiency and risk of respiratory tract infection such as covid-19 122 for example ilie and colleagues in 2020 examine the association between the mean levels of vd in 20 european countries and morbidity and mortality caused by covid-19 their analysis data identified negative correlations between mean levels of vd average 56 mmoll in each country and the number of covid-19 cases in addition a negative correlation was observed between mean levels of vd and the mortality of covid-19 cases they also reported that vd levels are severely low in the aging population especially in spain italy and switzerland the most vulnerable countries in relation to covid-19 123 additionally ebadi and montano-loza in 2020 reported that vd can suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory markers including il-1 il-1 as well as tnf- therefore vd deficiency during aging related to overexpression of th1 cytokines they also reported that 50 of patients with covid-19 and about 70 mortality of covid-19 observed in african-american population in chicago who are at a greater risk for vd deficiency 124 there are reports that polymorphism of vdr gene including polymorphisms of foki apai and taqi is associated with vd deficiency and increased risk of inflammatory diseases 125 hence vd and vdr pathway together have an important anti-inflammatory function in immune effectors through decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells furthermore the lack of vd in aged subjects is associated with the pro-inflammatory phenotype of immune cells leading to likely increasing the risk of elderly adults with chronic mild inflammation condition 122 this chronic inflammatory condition likely leads to cytokine storm in elderly covid-19 patientsin summary it seems that young adults have balanced between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine networks fig 1 therefore their balanced immune system can limit the progression of covid-19 infection however elderly patients do not have the same balanced immune response as young adults as shown fig 5 with advancing age the immune system appears to maintain a condition of mild inflammation so the activation of the body with pathogens such as covid-19 infection can exaggeratedly increase the amplitude of the immune response which is known as a cytokine storm as mentioned above alteration of ace2 receptor expression oxidative stress adipose tissue- and immune-senescent cell activity lack of vd content as well as decrease of autophagy and mitophagy may contribute to high amplitude of the immune response to external challengers in elderly adults this high amplitude of the immune response in elderly adults can favor induction of the cytokine storm and death in severe and critical cases of covid-19 infection nevertheless the covid-19 infection is not deadly in all elderly patients because the aging process is dependent on several markers including genes lifestyles individual variety of immune responses to challengerssars-cov-2 cov-19 is a sense rna virus with envelope- and spike-like projections on its surface 1 it belongs to coronavirinae family whose genomes consist of about 30 kilobases the largest genomes known among rna viruses two-thirds of their genome encodes viral replicasetranscriptase functions that are involved in virus replication while one-third encodes viral structural proteins and accessory proteins coronaviruses can infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans 2prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 only two coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were known to infect humans following 2003 additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans sars-cov hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the new sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are highly pathogenic in humans and cause severe acute respiratory distress with a high rate of mortality remarkably all three viruses are believed to have originated from bats 3 the latter sars-cov-2 emerged in late december 2019 as responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome named coronavirus disease covid-19 in wuhan hubei province china and rapidly outbroken into a major global pandemic 456 it has been proved to have stronger infectivity but less virulence compared to sars and mers 7covid-19 can manifest with a variety of symptoms from mild to severe flu fever cough fatigue shortness of breath infection of the lower respiratory tract pneumonia fibrosis with thrombosis in pulmonary small vessels etc and even death 34 it can also lead to complications associated with the immune response being out of control such as disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 8 the severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the affected individuals immune system and the presence of co-morbidities 9101112 a common feature is the strong inflammatory response which manifests through elevated c-reactive protein crp pro-inflammatory cytokines production il-6 il-10 il-1 higher tnf- neutrophil count d-dimer and blood urea 13 sars-cov-2 spreads in the population at a rate of 083 more than the normal flu and binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 with high affinity to infect humans 14 it mostly affects the elderly and people with chronic underlying diseases and it shows a preference for men 15 for reasons that we will discuss laterat present the only supporting treatments of cov-19 flu are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virussuch as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis recognized as the first causes of deathsymptomatic and respiratory support oxygen therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 9 in some critical circumstances convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin g have been administered to patients 16 several antiviral drugs and systemic corticosteroid treatment commonly used against influenza viruses are inefficient to treat covid-19 17 combinations of antiviral drugs immunomodulatory anti-parasite and common flu remedies have been tried with some results 18 but to date scientists all over the world are working intensively on the therapies and vaccines against the virusas already mentioned the spikes proteins of coronavirus bind to ace2 receptors fusing to the cell membrane and releasing the viral rna into the host cells the viral rnas are detected by toll-like receptors tlr 3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 hence viruscell interactions produce a diverse set of immune mediators against the virus viral replication in host cells is always associated with inflammation and immune activation 19the immune system has complex mechanisms to fulfill its function and respond to a variety of signaling molecules including hormones neurotransmitters and specific lipids such as endocannabinoids ecbs 20 the biological effects of cannabinoids are mediated through the activation of g-protein-coupled cannabinoid cb receptors 21 the endocannabinoid system ecs includes the cannabinoid receptor type 1 cb1 and 2 cb2 the endogenous cannabinoids and the enzymes for their metabolism cb1 is mostly expressed in the central nervous system and is strongly associated with the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids 22 cb1 is also expressed at low levels in peripheral tissues 23 instead cb2 is highly expressed by immune cells b cells natural killer cells monocytes neutrophils cd8 lymphocytes cd4 lymphocytes 2425 and in several organs and tissues such as liver spleen nasal epithelium thymus brain lung and kidney 262728 both cb1 and cb2 receptors have been widely demonstrated to be important modulators of the immune system potentially inducing immunosuppression 29 cb2 is widely known for its immunomodulatory role which is related to four events i induction of apoptosis ii suppression of cell proliferation iii inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines production and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines and iv induction of regulatory t cells 30 it is therefore conceivable that also in covid-19 the activation of the ecs plays a role in preventing andor influencing the development and the severity of the diseased9-tetrahydrocannabinol d9-thc and cannabidiol cbd are the phytocannabinoids that have been studied the most for their medicinal properties due to their ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation and inflammatory cytokine production 313233 however they bind to both cb receptors thus considering that cb1 receptors are localized predominantly in the central nervous system psychotropic effects have been often observed following their administration 23242526the specific activation of cb2 receptors induces apoptosis inhibits the production of autoantibodies pro-inflammatory cytokine expression matrix metalloproteinases and bone erosion and induces a shift from a th1 to th2 immune response and induced myeloid-derived suppressor and t-regulatory cells 34 in addition cb2 receptor exerts an inhibitory effect on inflammatory processes 29 including macrophage migration 35 and provides an important therapeutic target for reducing some immune-pathological processes associated with viral infections 313233therefore given the well-known involvement of cb2 receptors in immunomodulatory processes and the recent knowledge about the inflammatory coagulative and cytokines misbalance that covid-19 patients have to face we describe the possible role of the cb2 receptor in modulating them suggesting it as possible therapeutic target in covid-19the immune system acts through complex mechanisms to accomplish its defensive function cells participating in the immune response bear cannabinoid receptors and in particular cannabinoid receptors type 2 29 therefore the activation of these receptors might have a decisive role in preventing and modulating the development of an infective disease cb2 receptors are locally overexpressed in the presence of viral infection and their activation through a selective agonist inhibits the leukocytes migration into the site of inflammation 36many studies have examined the effect of cannabinoids on resistance to infections 9-thc treatment seems to sensitize to several microbial infections 37 such as herpes simplex virus type 2 since 9-thc suppresses host defenses and as well as the cb2 selective agonists has suppressive effects on b-cells monocytemacrophages and dendritic cells it is important to underline that compounds interfering with inflammatory processes could either compromise or improve the host response to viral infection because there are some viruses that benefit from host inflammation and other ones that are eradicated by host inflammation 3839 agonists of cb2 but not cb1 have been shown to reduce infection in primary cd4 t cells following cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission of cxcr4-tropic virus cb2 agonist have been shown to decrease cxcr4-activation-mediated g-protein activity and mapk phosphorylation alter the cytoskeletal architecture of resting cd4 t and impair productive infection following cell-free or cell-associated viral acquisition of cxcr4-tropic hiv-1 in resting cells thus indicating that the clinical use of cb2 receptor agonists in the treatment of aids symptoms may also exert beneficial adjunctive antiviral effects against cxcr4-tropic viruses in late stages of hiv-1 infection 32 cb2 stimulation also reduces some effects of inflammatory processes in hiv-infected patients 36 hiv infection causes changes in cb2 receptor expression as it has been observed during the process of in vitro monocyte differentiation into macrophages 40 cb2 increases as hiv infection progresses and on infected macrophages the exposure to cb2 receptors selective agonist jwh133 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of reverse transcriptase activityviral replication activity 41moreover acute viral respiratory infections could be responsible for the onset of secondary bacterial super-infections which cause a significant worsening of clinical course the bacterial super-infection is caused by bacterial colonization of respiratory tracts damaged by the viral infection and consequently alteration of host immune responses 42 sars-cov-2 in some cases caused secondary bacterial infection which worsened the prognosis 43 sepsis consists in both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive responses to an infection which can induce multiple organ failure and death the role of cb2 receptors in sepsis has been evaluated by tschp et al who demonstrated that cb2 stimulation plays a key role in neutrophils its stimulation in fact reduced neutrophils number decreasing mortality and tissue damage a reduced neutrophil recruitment during sepsis is associated with increased survival moreover neutrophils can kill bacteria and reduce tissue injury 44 therefore the use of cb2 selective agonists could be suggested to regulate neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance a variant of the cb2 receptor at codon 63 of the cb2 gene leads to the substitution of glutamine gln q with arginine arg r with a consequent difference in protein polarization these variants affect the response of cb2 receptor to cannabinoids the receptor carrying r showed a reduced immune modulation function when activated by cannabinoids therefore influencing the acquisition the severity and the duration of the infection from other rna viruses 4546 cannabinoids may also induce less damage to endothelial barriers thanks to their influence on several pro-inflammatory events 47 we found that in hivhcv-coinfected patients in t cells from qq subjects cb2 stimulation mediates the inhibition of their proliferation while in subjects with the rr haplotype t cells proliferation is reduced indicating that the cb2-63rr variant is associated with weaker and transient inhibition of t cells compared to the cb2-63qq the cb2 rr variant has been also indicated as a prognosis worsener of liver necroinflammation in hivhcv-coinfected patients while when it is caused by hcv monoinfection the cb2 qq variant is associated with more severe liver necroinflammation 48cb2 receptors activation has also been studied in children with viral respiratory infection using a selective agonist jwh133 the cb2 q63r variation was associated with a more severe clinical course of the acute viral infection and increased risk of hospitalization children infected with respiratory syncytial virus carrying the qq genotype showed the associated risk of developing severe respiratory complications increased more than two-fold cb2 receptors activation by jwh133 reduced the cytokines production and limited lung pathology 41 collectively cb2 receptor is associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection severity during infancy and it has been suggested as a therapeutic target to alleviate virus-associated immunopathology null mice for cannabinoid receptors show a greater inflammatory response to influenza infection strongly suggesting that cannabinoid receptors have a role in immuneregulation 4950taken together all those studies confirm that cb2 receptors have a central role in immune balance and negatively regulate the immune response magnitude the immune system fights foreign agents and the activation of cb2 receptors triggers anti-inflammatory action therefore targeting these receptors may be a novel and effective approach for the treatment of covid-19among the clinical features of covid-19 patients there is a very high number of circulating inflammatory molecules including c reactive protein crp and pro-inflammatory cytokines 51 in recent weeks several authors observed and confirmed this alteration 5253 in particular huang et al 54 measured cytokine levels in 41 patients reporting the increase of il-1 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf ifn granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor g-csf macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a tumor necrosis factor tnf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 seems to be critically high in severe covid-19 patients the altered cytokine profile observed in covid-19 patients is very similar to the cytokine storm cs that characterizes sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle east respiratory syndrome other two kinds of pneumonia caused by a coronavirus 55in the above-cited syndromes cs and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs lead to severe injury acute respiratory distress and death given the presence of cs also in covid-19 patients an anti-inflammatory therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs glucocorticoids cytokines antagonists monoclonal antibodies ie tocilizumab anakinra idroxiclorochin and others or jak inhibitors so far have proven to be helpful on the other hand the use of anti-inflammatory drugs could present some limits first of all cytokine inhibitors are available and specific only for a few of the cytokines actually involved in inflammatory cascade about the use of corticosteroids further investigations are needed their capability to reduce both inflammation and immune response could be beneficial as well as could delay the elimination of the virus but controversial hypotheses are present in literature regarding this issue chen wang et al 54 reported clinical evidence about sars 56 and mers 57 in which the administration of corticosteroids did not induce any difference in terms of mortality but it was only associated with a worst clearance of viral rna from the respiratory system moreover therapies reducing immune response such corticosteroids above mentioned could increase the risk of new infection as well as fuel existing infections 58 indeed patients treated with immunosuppressants are immunocompromised and therefore exposed to high hazard of mortality 59 puja mehta et al suggested in fact screening severe covid-19 patients for hyperinflammation considering ferritin levels platelet count erythrocyte sedimentation rate etc to identify individuals in which immunosuppression could be fatal 60therefore there are yet discordant opinions about the most suitable treatment in a multicenter study on 150 covid-19 patients in wuhan ruan q et al showed that in addition to the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines especially of il-6 there is also an increase in ferritin levels 61 these data suggest a virus-dependent hyperinflammation in which the immunosuppressive effect of anti-inflammatory drugs could be beneficial instead in 2016 shakoory b et al highlighted this effect of the il-1r antagonist anakinra in reducing mortality in patients with macrophage activation syndrome 62 these authors then suggest screening the severe covid-19 patients for hyperinflammation and identify those who could benefit from the immunosuppressive effect of anti-inflammatory therapythe role of the endocannabinoid system in modulating inflammation is well known and in particular in cytokine release in the literature it is reported that aea an endogenous agonist with high affinity to cb1 reduces the production of pro-inflammatory il-6 63 and it is known that thc a cb1 and cb2 receptor partial agonist inhibits the release of il-12 and ifn- 64 moreover in 2014 sardinha et al demonstrated in vivo that the inhibition of magl and faah the enzymes that respectively degrade 2-ag and aea has cb2-mediated anti-inflammatory effects 65 also e--caryophyllene e-bcp is a phytocannabinoid that selectively binds to the cb2 receptor and it is a functional cb2 agonist e-bcp inhibits lipopolysaccharide lps-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in peripheral blood and attenuates lps-stimulated erk12 and jnk12 phosphorylation in monocytes furthermore e-bcp administration strongly reduces the inflammatory response in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking cb2 receptors providing evidence that this natural product exerts cannabimimetic effects in vivo these results identify e-bcp as a functional non-psychoactive cb2 receptor ligand and as an anti-inflammatory cannabinoid e-bcp has effects also on vascular inflammation and significantly ameliorated vascular oxidative stress 6667furthermore there are several pieces of evidence about the specific involvement of cb2 receptor in modulating inflammation in different pathologies to begin in 2015 verty an et al 68 observed that jwh-015 a cb2 receptor agonist reduced obesity-associated inflammation in mice the next year 501 italian obese children were genotyped for the cb2 q63r variant a less functional variant of cb2 highlighting that this variant was associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory il-6 similar to the levels observed after blocking cb2 receptor in lean-derived adipocytes in vitro 69 this and many other alterations seem to contribute to the low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue in obese people 70 the same cb2 q63r variant was associated also with liver necroinflammation in chronic hepatitis patients with hivhcv coinfection 48 synovium inflammation in juvenile idiopathic arthritis 71 liver damage in children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 72 and inflammation of gastro-intestinal tract in inflammatory bowel disease crohns disease and ulcerative colitis 73 and in celiac disease 74 moreover it has been demonstrated that the cannabinoid cbd inhibits the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 il-8 and tnf- in in vitro models of allergic contact dermatitis 75 and in osteoarthritis thc reduced tnf- il-1 il-6 and il-8 release in lps-stimulated mg63 cells demonstrating the anti-inflammatory cb2-mediated role 76immune thrombocytopenia itp is another disease characterized by abnormal cytokine secretion and influenced by the presence of the cb2 q63r variant in particular mesenchymal stem cells from itp patients overproduce the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 regular levels are restored using jwh-133 a selective agonist at cb2 receptors 77 a proper activation of cb2 receptor reduces the levels of several inflammatory mediators il-6 il-1 and tnf- also in animal model of multiple sclerosis 78the importance of macrophages role in sars-cov-2 infection has been assessed by demonstrating a crosstalk between macrophages and the ace2-expressing cells in lung liver and stomach macrophages are recruited by cov-targeted cells during inflammation and they play a defensive or destructive role in infection 79 in particular it has been demonstrated that in lungs of covid-19 patients with diffused alveolar damages the cell infiltration consists mainly of macrophages and monocytes moderate mononuclear giant cells and very few lymphocytes after virus infection those cells are responsible for the primary cytokine storm mentioned above 55 the presence of inflammatory cells infiltration is responsible for acute lung injury causing acute respiratory distress syndrome and death 80macrophages are mononuclear phagocytes with a key role in inflammatory response cytokines production phagocytosis cellular proliferation and tissue restoration in wounds they are characterized by a remarkable plasticity showing two different activation phenotypes based on the microenvironment in which they lay 81 classically activated macrophages m1 and alternative activated macrophages m2 m1 macrophages are activated after interferon-gamma inf- and lipopolysaccharide lps stimulation they exhibit pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties by releasing various types of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemochines such as tumor necrosis factor tnf interleukin-6 il-6 interleukin-1 beta il-1 and nitric oxide synthase inos on the other hand m2 polarization is promoted both by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pi3k-akt-mtor signaling pathway and by the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 il-4 and interleukin-10 il-10 they perform anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 and promote tumor progression an imbalance of m1m2 is responsible of inflammation 818283it is known that cb2 receptors are mainly expressed in peripheral immune cells including macrophages 20 several studies have demonstrated a role for this receptor as a mediator of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties it inhibits immune cell activation and pro-inflammatory mediator release cytokines reactive oxygen species ros nitric oxide etc thus it has been suggested as a possible target for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease juvenile idiopathic arthritis inflammatory bowel disease celiac disease obesity and neuroinflammatory diseases 8485 all these pathologies are characterized by an alteration of immune cell activation and an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines releasemoreover it has been shown that cb2 receptor stimulation with its selective agonists reversed these pathological conditions by reducing both b and t lymphocyte 86 by promoting mesenchymal stromal cells mscs homing and immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities 7787 and by limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release in macrophages inhibiting m1 polarization 83several studies have highlighted the importance of the role of cb2 receptors as regulators of macrophage polarization in inflammatory processes in particular it has been shown that its stimulation with selective agonists induced a reduction of the pro-inflammatory macrophage population m1 and an increase of the anti-inflammatory phenotype m2 88 du et al have demonstrated that stimulation of cb2 receptor with its selective agonist jwh-133 attenuated inflammation during skin wound healing by inhibiting m1 macrophages rather than by activating m2 macrophages in skin lesion they showed a significant reduction of m1 markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines cd86 inos il-6 and il-12 after treatment with jwh133 or gp1a these results indicated that cb2 inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines preventing the macrophages polarization to the m1 phenotype 83also in neuroinflammation cb2 receptor stimulation exerts its anti-inflammatory effects modulating macrophage polarization braun et al demonstrated that in patients with neuroinflammation induced by traumatic brain injury stimulation of cb2 receptor with its selective agonist gp1a induced m2 anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and inhibited m1 pro-inflammatory polarization determining a reduction of pro-inflammatory mediator expression tnf il1 il6 ccl2 cxcl10 and inos and an increase of anti-inflammatory mediator expression il10 argi 88cb2 receptor displays its anti-inflammatory properties also in alcoholic liver disease by acting on kupffer cells polarization louvet et al proposed cb2 receptors as a novel regulator of kupffer cell polarization their in vivo and in vitro experiments showed an increase of m1 phenotype markers and a reduction of the m2 phenotype markers in response to chronic alcohol feeding after genetic deletion of cb2 instead after jwh-133 treatment they observed an inhibition of pro-inflammatory m1 profile by shifting the m1m2 balance toward a predominant alternative m2 response and a reduction of inflammation 26 moreover human lung-resident macrophages express cb2 receptor and its stimulation induces a reduction in the release of some pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and angiogenic factors 89in covid-19 patients an alteration in cytokine production is present that is very similar to the process called cytokine storm characterized also by an overproduction of immune cells 59 considering the well-known anti-inflammatory function of mesenchymal stromal cells mscs 9091 in the last few months several authors investigated the possibility to use mscs to treat covid-19 patients in particular these cells seem to reduce the secretion of inflammatory factors thus improving lung function after acute injury caused for example by influenza virus jiajia chen et al 92 performed a clinical study in which they tested menstrual-blood-derived mscs in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards caused by h7n9 infection and observed benefits in the most severe casesh7n9 is a subtype of influenza a viruses with symptoms very similar to covid-19 cough fever shortness of breath etc and with similar complications ards and lung failure 9394 hence the authors suggested that a therapeutic strategy used to manage h7n9 inflammatory damages could be used also in ards-induced severe pneumonia of covid-19 patients in detail mscs have the capability to increase the number of peripheral lymphocytes and at the same time to reduce the cytokine-secreting immune cells cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and nk cells in the circulating blood 9596 without any adverse reaction 97 this immunomodulatory effect is due to their interaction with immune cells directly or mediated by paracrine cytokines 9899 beyond the great influence that mscs exert on immune response it has also been observed that they produce a specific molecule the leukemia inhibitor factor lif useful in counteracting the cytokine storm in viral pneumonia 100 the lif amount produced by mscs is not enough but in literature is reported the use of synthetic stem cells lif-nano with a 1000-fold greater potency in producing lif and able to reverse paralysis in preclinical model of multiple sclerosis within 4 days 101from our previous studies we know that mscs abundantly express cb2 receptors and that this feature together with the above-described characteristics makes them suitable in managing cov-19 infection it has been observed that the selective stimulation of mscs with agonists at cb2 receptor jwh-133 improved their survival and their immunomodulating properties with important impact in regulating lymphocytes activity and cytokine secretion 77 on these bases mscs therapy together with a proper stimulation of their cb2 receptor could be proposed to improve covid-19 patients conditions with a double function to repair tissue damages on stem cells and to drive immune response in a protective direction immunomodulating cells mscs are easy to access and isolate from different sources umbilical cord dental pulp menstrual blood etc and they can be stored for repetitive therapeutic usage with absolute effectiveness 102103104 moreover with rna-sequencing it has been observed that mscs are negative for ace2 and tmprss2 105 the main proteins involved in covid-19 pathogenesis therefore these cells can be safely infused in affected patients without being infected by cov-19 rather bringing all the above-mentioned beneficial effects to the host 106 figure 1several epidemiological studies suggest sex-specific differences in the incidence of cov-19sars-cov-2 with men more susceptible to infection about 70 of infected patients than women 155254 interestingly this difference has already been observed in the past for other viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 107108 in effect it is already widely known that males and females react differently to rna virus infections 64 in general males respond with a less strong immune response 109 women are less susceptible to viral infections for various reasons related to a different innate immunity sex chromosomes 110 and especially steroid hormones 111 female hormones seem to confer a natural resistance against many diseases at high concentrations estrogens have an immune-suppressive effect and at low concentrations exhibit an important immune-stimulatory activity 112 steroid hormones exert their effects through intracellular receptors that can regulate the expression of target genes by binding to specific enhancer elements 113 the role of estrogens in modulating cannabinoid receptor expression and endocannabinoids levels is widely known both in physiological and in pathological conditions 114115116 studies have demonstrated that 17-estradiol increases the expression of cb2 receptors in osteoclasts in vitro through the recruitment of an estrogen-responsive element in the cb2 gene 117 in addition selective estrogens receptor modulators raloxifene bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene act as cb2 receptors agonists 118119 estrogens and cannabinoids share several molecular pathways and involvement in several inflammatory processes 120 peretz et al demonstrated a role of estrogens in inhibiting influenza a virus replication in nasal epithelial cells derived from humans 121 accordingly channappanavar et al showed a protective effect of estrogen signaling in mice infected with sars-cov-1 demonstrating that the ovariectomy or pharmacological antagonism of estrogen receptor in female mice increases mortality 122 moreover they observed a large number of macrophages and an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of sars-cov1infected ovariectomized mice compared with control female mice suggesting that estrogen signaling is able to suppress macrophage activity in the lungs probably through the nf-b inhibition and the subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production 122 considering that the cb2 receptor regulates the immune system and inhibits inflammation in many inflammatory disease 85 it is conceivable that the protective effects of estrogens could strongly be related to a cb2 receptor activation in a model of lung injury cb2 receptor up-regulation inhibits nf- activity reducing pro-inflammatory factors release tnf- il-12 and il-6 and increasing anti-inflammatory factors il-10 and il-4 production 123 confirming that cb2 receptors activation may act as a novel immunomodulatory strategy to alleviate lung diseases through the inhibition of immune cellswe have discussed the clinical features of sars-cov-2 infection including the severe acute inflammation that causes cytokine storm in covid-19 patientscb2 receptors stimulation is known to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects by reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by shifting the m1m2 ratio towards the anti-inflammatory m2 macrophage phenotype and by improving the mscs-repairing properties it is also well documented that human lungs macrophages and mscs express cb2 receptors estrogens exert a protective effect in covid-19 which explains sex-specific differences observed in sars-cov-2 infection this could also be related to a cb2 activation we suggest therefore the possibility of using cb2 as a pharmacological target for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infectionwe hypothesize that the selective stimulation of cb2 could reduce the inflammatory response in sars-cov-2 patients and could improve the outcome the stimulation of cb2 could control the inflammatory cascade in several checkpoints considering its capability to reduce the production of a large number of cytokines contrarily to the extremely selective action of monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific interleukin on the other hand cb2 receptor stimulation has a well-documented immunosuppressive effect by reducing immune cells proliferation 124 and production of antibodies 125 thus it could be greatly beneficial in containing the exacerbated inflammatory response in covid-19 patientsto date there are no commercially available agonists approved for the use in human subjects that specifically bind to cb2 receptors hu910 hu308 and jwh133 have high specificity to cb2 receptors and are recommended to study the role of this receptor in biological processes and diseases 126 cannabidiol cbd is also involved in modulation of inflammatory processes through a cb2-dependent mechanism it induces cb2 activation indirectly by increasing aea levels and exerts its anti-inflammatory properties by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines release in experimental model of allergic contact dermatitis 127 a novel 9-tetrahydrocannabinol 9-thcp binds with high affinity to both human cb1 and cb2 receptors in particular the affinity shown for cb1 is thirty-fold higher compared to the one reported for 9-thc in the literature and it was 5 to 10 times more active on the cb2 receptor it has also been demonstrated that 9-thcp showed a cannabimimetic activity several times higher than its pentyl homolog 9-thc also at lower doses 127 nevertheless more studies are necessary to develop a commercially available cb2 selective agonist and clinical studies with the available phytocannabinoids should be encouragedanother interesting field of investigation could be the screening of covid-19 patients for cb2 q63r in this way it would be possible to clarify if also in this case the variant is a predisposing factor to the infection and also if it is associated with the appearance of the most severe side effects respiratory distress pulmonary fibrosis and death all these actions could produce better knowledge on sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and significantly improve the management of covid-19 patientssevere acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged for the first time in wuhan china in december 2019 it is a type of highly pathogenic human coronavirus hcov that causes zoonotic diseases and poses a major threat to public health the vast majority of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have had a good prognosis but there were still some critical individuals and even deaths1
most of these critically ill and dead patients did not develop severe clinical manifestations in the early stages of the disease some of the patients only showed mild fever cough or muscle soreness the conditions of these patients deteriorated suddenly in the later stages of the disease or in the process of recovery acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple-organ failure occurred rapidly resulting in death within a short time2 cytokine storm is considered to be one of the major causes of ards and multiple-organ failure3 it plays an important role in the process of disease aggravation4 clinical studies have detected a cytokine storm in critical patients with covid-19 therefore effectively suppressing the cytokine storm is an important way to prevent the deterioration of patients with covid-19 infection and save the patients lives5 this article reviews the mechanisms by which hcov infection induces cytokine storm and the options to inhibit the cytokine storm in order to provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of covid-19coronaviruses covs are single-stranded positive-strand rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family nidovirales order the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv classifies the covs into four categories    and  under the electron microscope the virus particles display a rough spherical or multi-faceted crystal shape the surface of the viruses has prominent club-shaped projections composed of its spike protein inside the virus particle is the viral genome wrapped in a nucleocapsid the viral genome contains approximately 26000 to 32000 bases covs are the largest known rna viruses the positive-strand viral rna consists of a cap structure at the 5 end and multiple polya tails at the 3 end it serves as messenger rna mrna allowing the translation of replicasetranscriptase and viral structural proteins the replicasetranscriptase genes account for approximately 23 of the 5-end rna sequence and are composed of two overlapping open reading frames orfs orf1a and orf1b the orfs encode 16 non-structural proteins the remaining 13 of the rna sequence encodes four classical viral structural proteins namely spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein in addition genes encoding some viral accessory proteins are interspersed in the coding regions of the viral structural proteins the coding sites and number of these accessory protein genes are an important basis for cov classification covs can infect a variety of host species including birds humans and some other vertebrates these viruses mainly cause respiratory and intestinal infections and induce a variety of clinical manifestations6

coronaviruses have long been recognized as important pathogens that infect the respiratory tracts of domestic and companion animals and are the causes of mild and severe respiratory diseases in humans7

8 so far seven hcovs that can invade humans have been identified including the -type hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 the -type hcov-hku1 sars-cov mers-cov and hcov-oc43 and 2019-ncov causing the present epidemic according to their pathogenicity hcovs are divided into mildly pathogenic hcovs including hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku and highly pathogenic covs including severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov9 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 10

11 and sars-cov-2 the mildly pathogenic hcovs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause seasonal mild to moderate cold-like respiratory diseases in healthy individuals in contrast the highly pathogenic hcovs hereinafter referred to as pathogenic hcovs or hcovs infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia sometimes leading to fatal acute lung injury ali and ards the pathogenic hcovs have high morbidity and mortality and pose a major threat to public health12 13 14
it has long been believed that cytokines play an important role in immunopathology during viral infection a rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection however dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immune damage to the human body15 16 17 the relevant evidences from severely ill patients with hcovs suggest that proinflammatory responses play a role in the pathogenesis of hcovs in vitro cell experiments show that delayed release of cytokines and chemokines occurs in respiratory epithelial cells dendritic cells dcs and macrophages at the early stage of sars-cov infection later the cells secrete low levels of the antiviral factors interferons ifns and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il-1 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf and chemokines c-c motif chemokine ligand ccl-2 ccl-3 and ccl-518 19 20 like sars mers-cov infects human airway epithelial cells thp-1 cells a monocyte cell line human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dcs and induces delayed but elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines21

22 after mers-cov infection plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not mononuclear macrophages and dcs23 are induced to produce a large amount of ifnsserum cytokine and chemokine levels are significantly higher in patients with severe mers than patients with mild to moderate mers24

25 the elevated serum cytokine and chemokine levels in mers patients are related to the high number of neutrophils and monocytes in the patients lung tissues and peripheral blood suggesting that these cells may play a role in lung pathology24 25 26 similar phenomena have been observed in patients with sars-cov infection27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 the production of ifn-i or ifn- is the key natural immune defense response against viral infections and ifn-i is the key molecule that plays an antiviral role in the early stages of viral infection35

36 delayed release of ifns in the early stages of sars-cov and mers-cov infection hinders the bodys antiviral response36 afterward the rapidly increased cytokines and chemokines attract many inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocytes resulting in excessive infiltration of the inflammatory cells into lung tissue and thus lung injury it appears from these studies that dysregulated andor exaggerated cytokine and chemokine responses by sars-cov-infected or mers-cov-infected cells could play an important role in pathogenesis of sars or mersanimal models can well elucidate the role of cytokines and chemokines in mediating pulmonary immunopathology after hcov infection despite of similar virus titers in the respiratory tract sars-cov-infected old nonhuman primates are more likely to develop immune dysregulation than the infected young primates leading to more severe disease manifestations37 it seems that the excessive inflammatory response rather than the virus titer is more relevant to the death of the old nonhuman primates37 similarly in balbc mice infected with sars-cov disease severity in old mice is related to the early and disproportionately strong upregulation of the ards-related inflammatory gene signals38 the rapid replication of sars-cov in balbc mice induces the delayed release of ifn- which is accompanied by the influx of many pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages15 the accumulated mononuclear macrophages receive activating signals through the ifn- receptors on their surface and produce more monocyte chemoattractants such as ccl2 ccl7 and ccl12 resulting in the further accumulation of mononuclear macrophages these mononuclear macrophages produce elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines tnf il-6 il1- and inducible nitric oxide synthase thereby increasing the severity of the disease depleting inflammatory monocyte-macrophages or neutralizing the inflammatory cytokine tnf protected mice from the fatal sars-cov infection in addition ifn- or mononuclear macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines induce the apoptosis of t cells which further hinders viral clearance15 another consequence of rapid viral replication and vigorous proinflammatory cytokinechemokine response is the induction of apoptosis in lung epithelial and endothelial cells ifn- and ifn- induce inflammatory cell infiltration through mechanisms involving fasfas ligand fasl or traildeath receptor 5 dr5 and cause the apoptosis of airway and alveolar epithelial cells39 40 41 apoptosis of endothelial cells and epithelial cells damages the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barriers and causes vascular leakage and alveolar edema eventually leading to hypoxia in the body therefore inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ardsards is the leading cause of death in patients infected with sars-cov or mers-cov42

43 it is now known that several proinflammatory cytokines il-6 il-8 il-1 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and reactive oxygen species and chemokines such as ccl2 ccl-5 ifn-induced protein 10 ip-10 and ccl3 all contribute to the occurrence of ards44 45 46 these results support such points of view that following sars-cov infection high virus titers and dysregulation of cytokinechemokine response cause an inflammatory cytokine storm the inflammatory cytokine storm is accompanied by immunopathological changes in the lungshigh levels of expression of il-1b ifn- ip-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 have been detected in patients with covid-19 these inflammatory cytokines may activate the t-helper type 1 th1 cell response47 th1 activation is a key event in the activation of specific immunity48 however unlike sars patients patients with covid-19 also have elevated levels of th2 cell-secreted cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 which inhibit the inflammatory response the serum levels of il-2r and il-6 in patients with covid-19 are positively correlated with the severity of the disease ie critically ill patients  severely ill patients  ordinary patients49 other studies have found that compared with covid-19 patients from general wards patients in the intensive care unit icu display increased serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ip-10 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1a and tnf- the above studies suggest that the cytokine storm is positively correlated with disease severity47
a report on the severe new-type coronavirus-infected pneumonia showed that 37 patients 712 required mechanical ventilation and 35 patients 673 suffered ards moreover the mortality of the elderly patients with ards was significantly elevated50 the core pathological change in ards is the pulmonary and interstitial tissue damage caused by nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltration51 local excessive release of cytokines is the decisive factor that induces this pathological change and clinical manifestation52 in covid-19 the inflammatory cytokine storm is closely related to the development and progression of ards the serum levels of cytokines are significantly increased in patients with ards and the degree of increase is positively correlated with mortality rate53 the cytokine storm is also a key factor in determining the clinical course of extrapulmonary multiple-organ failure54 this partially explains the signs of extrapulmonary organ failure such as elevated liver enzymes and creatinine seen in some covid-19 patients without respiratory failure suggesting that the inflammatory cytokine storm is the cause of damage to extrapulmonary tissues and organsin summary the new-type coronavirus infection causes an inflammatory cytokine storm in patients the cytokine storm leads to ards or extrapulmonary multiple-organ failure and is an important factor that causes covid-19 exacerbation or even deathhigh virus titer and the subsequent strong inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are related to the high morbidity and mortality observed during the pathogenic hcov infection the experience from treating sars and mers shows that reducing viral load through interventions in the early stages of the disease and controlling inflammatory responses through immunomodulators are effective measures to improve the prognosis of hcov infection55 56 57 58
ifn- primarily activates epithelial cells and reduces the mononuclear macrophage-mediated proinflammatory activity of ifn-59 in addition ifn- inhibits the recruitment of neutrophils to the sites of inflammation60 sars-cov and mers-cov mainly infect alveolar epithelial cells aec ifn- activates the antiviral genes in epithelial cells thereby exerting antiviral effects without overstimulating the human immune system therefore ifn- may be an ideal treatment some studies have applied pegylated and non-pegylated interferons for the treatment of hcovs but the efficacy varied significantly due to the application of different treatment regimens early administration of interferons has certain benefits in reducing viral load and improves the clinical symptoms of patients to a certain extent however it fails to reduce mortality rates61 62 63 with the exception of early administration the use of interferons at other time periods will not bring more benefits than placebo treatment63
corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that have anti-inflammatory functions corticosteroids are commonly used to suppress inflammation during the 2003 sars epidemic corticosteroids were the primary means of immunomodulation timely administration of corticosteroids often leads to early improvements such as reducing fever relieving radiation infiltration of the lung and improving oxygenation64 65 66 a retrospective study of 401 patients with severe sars revealed that proper administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe sars significantly reduced the mortality rate and shortened the hospital stay moreover secondary infections and other complications rarely occurred in these glucocorticoid-treated patients67 however there are studies showing that administration of corticosteroid therapy during human sars-cov infection led to adverse consequences early treatment of sars patients with corticosteroids increased plasma viral load in non-icu patients resulting in the aggravation of the disease64
in treatment of patients with covid-19 the use of glucocorticoids has again become a major conundrum for clinicians68 the timing of administration and the dosage of glucocorticoids are very important to the outcome of the severely ill patients a too early administration of glucocorticoids inhibits the initiation of the bodys immune defense mechanism thereby increasing the viral load and ultimately leading to adverse consequences therefore glucocorticoids are mainly used in critically ill patients suffering inflammatory cytokine storm inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ards and protects the functions of the patients organs for patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators rapid imaging progress and excessive inflammatory response the use of glucocorticoid in the short term 35 days is appropriate and the recommended dose is no more than equivalent to methylprednisolone 12 mgkgday69 it should be noted that large doses of glucocorticoid may delay the clearance of coronavirus due to immunosuppressionchen et al analyzed the treatment of 99 wuhan patients with covid-19 and found that 27 of these patients had received ivig treatment70 ivig therapy has the dual effects of immune substitution and immunomodulation its practical application value in treatment of covid-19 needs confirmation in future studiesduring the cytokine storm the three most important cytokines in the il-1 family are il-1 il-18 and il-334 studies that focus on the inhibition of il-1 to reduce the cytokine storm have attracted most attention anakinra an antagonist of il-1 can be used to treat the cytokine storm caused by infection it significantly improved the 28-day survival rate of patients with severe sepsis71 there is currently no clinical experience with applying specific il-1 family blockers to treat covid-19 their effects need to be verified through in vivo animal experiments and clinical trialstocilizumab is an il-6 antagonist that suppresses the function of the immune system currently tocilizumab is mainly applied in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis72 tocilizumab itself has a therapeutic effect on the infection-induced cytokine storm73 serum il-6 level is significantly increased in severely ill patients with covid-19 clinical studies from china have shown that tocilizumab is effective in treating severely ill patients with extensive bilateral lung lesions who have elevated il-6 levels the first dose was 48 mgkg the recommended dosage was 400mg with 09 saline diluted to 100 ml the infusion time was more than 1 h for patients with poor efficacy of the first dose an additional dose can be applied after 12 h the dose is the same as before with a maximum of two cumulative dosetnfs are key inflammatory factors that trigger a cytokine storm they are attractive targets for controlling the cytokine storm a meta-analysis showed that anti-tnf therapy has significantly improved survival in patients with sepsis74 anti-tnf therapy has also achieved satisfactory outcomes in treatment of noninfectious diseases such as atherosclerosis75 studies in animal models have shown that tnfs contribute significantly to acute lung injury and impair the t cell response in sars-cov-challenged mice in mice neutralization of tnf activity or loss of tnf receptor provides protection against sars-cov-induced morbidity and mortality15

76 however it should be noted that at least in the later stages of infection tnf has not been detected in the serum of patients with sars at present tnf blockers have not been suggested in the treatment of patients with covid-19 but the efficacy of tnf blockers in treatment of patients with covid-19 deserves further explorationifn- limits viral replication by inducing ifn-stimulated gene however ifn- also exacerbates diseases through enhancing the recruitment and function of mononuclear macrophages and other innate immune cells although an early interferon response has a protective effect on mice infected with sars-cov delayed ifn- signaling causes an imbalance of the anti-sars-cov immune responses in humans this phenomenon indicates that the timing of ifn treatment is crucial to the outcome of diseases based on these results ifn- receptor blockers or antagonists should be administered in the later stages of severe disease to prevent excessive inflammatory responses16
chloroquine inhibits the production and release of tnf and il-6 which indicates that chloroquine may suppress the cytokine storm in patients infected with covid-1977 chloroquine phosphate has been used in the treatment of adults aged 18 to 65 in china78 the recommended dosage by diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 from china is as follows if the weight is more than 50 kg 500 mg each time 2 times a day 7 days as a treatment course if the weight is less than 50 kg 500 mg each time on the first and second days twice a day 500 mg each time on the third to seventh days once a dayulinastatin is a natural anti-inflammatory substance in the body it protects the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the production and release of inflammatory mediators ulinastatin is widely used in clinical practice to treat pancreatitis and acute circulatory failure ulinastatin reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors such as tnf- il-6 and ifn- and increases the level of anti-inflammatory factor il-1079 these activities of ulinastatin promote the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in humans thus interrupting the cytokine storm induced by the vicious cycle of inflammation animal studies show that the anti-inflammatory effect of high-dose ulinastatin is equivalent to that of hormones80 however unlike glucocorticoids ulinastatin does not inhibit immune functions and is unlikely to cause sequelae such as femoral head necrosis therefore ulinastatin has great application prospects in the treatment of covid-19in a mouse model of influenza a virus iav infection oxpl increases the production of cytokineschemokines in lung macrophages through the toll-like receptor 4 tlr4tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- signaling pathway thereby promoting the occurrence of ali81 eritoran is a tlr4 antagonist it does not have direct antiviral activity but has strong immunomodulatory functions eritoran effectively lowers the production of oxpl inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in iav-infected mice thereby reducing death82 pathogenic human coronaviruses also cause a high accumulation of oxpl in patients lung tissues resulting in ali81 thus it seems that eritoran and other oxpl inhibitors may also be able to alleviate hcov-induced inflammatory responsessphingosine-1-phosphate s1p is a signal lysophospholipid that promotes cytokine synthesis and secretion83 the s1p receptor signaling pathways significantly inhibit the pathological damage induced by the hosts innate and adaptive immune responses thereby reducing the cytokine storm caused by influenza virus infection84

85 in mouse models of iav infection sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 s1p1 signal transduction in respiratory endothelial cells modulates pathogenic inflammatory responses85 agonists targeting s1p1 inhibit excessive recruitment of inflammatory cells inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reduce the morbidity and mortality of iav85

86 sars-cov-2 also mainly infects human lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells therefore s1p1 agonists may be potential therapeutic drugs for reducing cytokine and chemokine responses in those hcov patients whose cells generated excessive immune responses an s1p-receptor modulating drug siponimod was approved in 2019 to treat multiple sclerosis however clinical trials are needed to further verify whether siponimod is an ideal alternative for the treatment of cytokine stormas an important member of the stem cell family mesenchymal stem cells msc not only have the potential of self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation but also have strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions msc can inhibit the abnormal activation of t lymphocytes and macrophages and induce their differentiation into regulatory t cell treg subsets and anti-inflammatory macrophages respectively it can also inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 tnf- il-6 il-12 and ifn- thereby reducing the occurrence of cytokine storms87

88 at the same time msc can secrete il-10 hepatocyte growth factor keratinocyte growth factor and vegf to alleviate ards regenerate and repair damaged lung tissues and resist fibrosis89 therefore many functions of msc are expected to make it an effective method for the treatment of covid-19in addition the blood purification treatments currently used in clinic practice can remove inflammatory factors to a certain extent blood purification system including plasma exchange adsorption perfusion bloodplasma filtration etc can remove inflammatory factors block the cytokine storm to reduce the damage of inflammatory response to the body this therapy can be used for severe and critical patients in the early and middle stages of the disease the artificial liver technology led by academician li lanjuan can eliminate inflammatory factors on a large scale this technology has also been used to resist the cytokine storm of h7n9 and its application on covid-19 has also achieved certain efficacy90 early renal replacement therapy which is similar to the treatment principle of artificial liver technology seems to be an effective method to control cytokine storm91
an autopsy report of patients with covid-19 revealed a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of the deceased92 one potentially effective treatment approach is to reduce the recruitment of mononuclear macrophages to the site of inflammation through small interfering rna sirna-mediated silencing of c-c chemokine receptor type 2 ccr2 which has been demonstrated by animal experiments to improve the outcome of the disease93

94 toll-like receptor 7 tlr7 agonists stimulate mononuclear macrophages to undergo a strong inflammatory response at the time of infection with single-stranded rna ssrna viruses such as hcov therefore tlr7 antagonists may be able to alleviate the storm of inflammatory factors caused by sars-cov-2 infectionincreased vascular permeability is also a hallmark change that occurs in the process of a cytokine storm it was found in animal infection models of sepsis and h5n1 virus that activation of the endothelial slit-robo4 pathway with drugs improved vascular permeability thereby reducing the occurrence of a cytokine storm during infection95
inflammation is an essential part of an effective immune response it is difficult to eliminate infections successfully without inflammation the inflammatory response begins with an initial recognition of pathogens the pathogens then mediate the recruitment of immune cells which eliminates the pathogens and ultimately leads to tissue repair and restoration of homeostasis however sars-cov-2 induces excessive and prolonged cytokinechemokine responses in some infected individuals known as the cytokine storm cytokine storm causes ards or multiple-organ dysfunction which leads to physiological deterioration and death timely control of the cytokine storm in its early stage through such means as immunomodulators and cytokine antagonists as well as the reduction of lung inflammatory cell infiltration is the key to improving the treatment success rate and reducing the mortality rate of patients with covid-19 fig 1
the authors declare that they have no competing financial interestsas of 20 april almost 17 million people globally have been diagnosed with corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 a pandemic that has evolved from the emergence of a new coronavirus strain acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in china more than 170000 deaths have been reported while there are certainly many more cases of milder disease that have not been diagnosed and officially confirmed due to limited testing capacity in most countries the pandemic is a global emergency due to the rapid transmission of the disease and the potential to overwhelm the healthcare systems and is expected to have considerable economic and health impacts possible contributing factors their possible role in the relatively high infection death rates between countries and origin have recently been studied 12 this new outbreak has been additionally evaluated for current knowledge on coronaviruses based on a short history to epidemiology pathogenesis clinical manifestation of the disease as well as treatment and prevention strategies 3 the search for potential protective and therapeutic antiviral strategies is of particular and urgent concern 4while in most cases especially in young people without any comorbidities the disease is expected to be relatively mild there is a substantial proportion of patients who develop complications and need intensive care-unit support and mechanical intubation in one case series of 1099 patients in china 5 61  of cases suffered from the primary composite end-point of admission to an intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death patients with severe disease typically present with dyspnea and hypoxemia shortly after disease initiation and may quickly progress to respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure 6 predictors of adverse outcomes include elevated levels of inflammatory markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines a study of 150 covid-19 cases reported that elevated levels of c-reactive protein crp ferritin and il-6 were associated with death 7 il-6 an important pro-inflammatory cytokine was elevated in fatal cases of covid-19 in another study of 191 patients 8 another study of 452 patients reported that those with severe disease showed lymphocytopenia neutrophilia low levels of monocytes eosinophils and basophils and elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines 9 pathological examination of a case in china revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage desquamation of pneumocytes hyaline membrane formation and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates 10 flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed reduced levels of cd4 and cd8  t cells which however were hyper-activated and elevated concentration of pro-inflammatory ccr6 th17 in cd4  t cells such findings are hallmarks of ards and resemble features observed in sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome 1112 systemic vasculitis was also observed 10 therefore it seems that immune dysregulation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of severe covid-19while for decades common thinking suggested that every immune response to antigenic invasion was always beneficial in averting potential damage studies in the 1980s identified that immune cells produce proteins with pleiotropic properties having the potential to be either beneficial or harmful 13 the proteins called cytokines were found to cause clinical manifestations similar to sepsis such as hemodynamic instability fever and localized inflammation 1415 cytokines are important in mediating both immune cell recruitment and complex intracellular signaling control mechanisms that characterize inflammation and infection control they are expressed by numerous cells including macrophages monocytes b cells and t cells promote differentiation of t-helper cells and stimulate cd4 cells 16 while activation of the immune system is important in fighting pathogens dysregulation of cytokine production may lead to uncontrolled effects that can ultimately be detrimental to health 1617cytokine storm also called macrophage activation syndrome is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and drugs 18 it represents a failure of the inflammatory response to return to homeostasis the resulting unregulated immune activity can potentially lead to catastrophic tissue damage the term first appeared in 1993 in an article relevant to graft-versus-host disease 19 subsequently cytokine storm was a phenomenon recognized in both viral and bacterial infections it has been particularly studied in viral infections such as cytomegalovirus pneumonitis influenza virus and sars-cov 20 21 22 23 bermejo-martin et al 21 recruited both inpatients and outpatients during the first wave of the pandemic flu in 2009 nvh1n1 and examined the effects of immune host responses to the evolution of mild or severe disease by measuring serum levels of several chemokines and cytokines they found a dramatic increase of mediators that stimulate th-1 responses and th-17 responses which are responsible for attacking intracellular pathogens and clearing pathogens during host defence reactions among severe hospitalized patients compared to milder cases of nvh1n1 infection during the 2009 pandemic the cytokine storm can result in acute lung injury and further progress to ards this is characterized by local infiltration of inflammatory cells increased vascular permeability and systemic spillover of inflammatory mediators that can cause systemic sepsis-like symptoms 23 while focus on cytokine storm detection relies mostly on measuring cytokines in the systemic circulation it has been suggested that measuring systemic inflammatory mediators may underestimate the extent of the immunological cascade that takes place locally in deep tissues such as the respiratory tract 23 considering the above controlling the inflammatory response may be an effective way of preventing collateral damage caused by the excessive activation of the immune system to clear pathogenssince the early 2000s the cholinergic nervous system has been identified as an important pathway that modifies and controls the inflammatory response surgical dissection of the vagus nerve in mice led to enhanced tnf production and excessive response to endotoxin administration while vagus nerve electrical stimulation inhibits the synthesis of tnf and prevents the acute inflammatory response 24 25 26 several animal experimental models inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as sepsis ischemia-reperfusion and pancreatitis have shown that vagus stimulation improves outcomes this effect is mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nachr 7 subunit on macrophages 27 mice deficient of the 7 subunit exhibited increased endotoxin-induced tnf production and electrical vagus innervation failed to reduce serum tnf levels 27 b-lymphocytes also express 7 nachrs macrophages appear to be very sensitive to acetylcholine which suggests that any source of acetylcholine even from non-neuronal sources such as epithelial and endothelial cells could also modulate the activity of adjacent macrophages 25 besides tnf other pro-inflammatory cytokines are inhibited by acetylcholine such as high mobility group b1 hmgb1 il-1 and il-6 28modulation of inflammatory and immune response by the central nervous system cns through the vagus nerve is based on bi-directional communication between the immune and nervous systems afferent vagus nerve fibers located in nucleus tractus solitarius provide sensory input to the cns about the inflammatory status that can result in the transmission of efferent signals originating from the dorsal motor nucleus to control the inflammatory response 29 such a response is rapid and localized unlike the diffusible anti-inflammatory network which is slow distributed non-integrated and dependent on concentration gradients 25smoking is known to increase the risk for respiratory infection susceptibility and severity 3031 considering that covid-19 was declared by the world health organization as a pandemic a substantial disease burden would be expected among the estimated 11 billion smokers especially in countries with high smoking prevalence therefore there were understandable concerns about this population subgroup 32 additionally smoking-related disease conditions such as cardiovascular disease and copd are also established risk factors for adverse outcomes in covid-19 33 china was the first country to be affected by the pandemic and has a high smoking prevalence in 2018 the population smoking prevalence was 266  with a much higher prevalence in men 505  than in women 21  34 therefore a high smoking prevalence among patients with covid-19 would be expected even if smoking did not adversely affect disease susceptibility and severityon 23 march a preliminary analysis by some members of our group examined data from 5 case series of hospitalized covid-19 patients from china and calculated a smoking prevalence of 102  95  ci 87118  while the estimated expected prevalence was 313  95  ci 87118  35 the analysis was further expanded on 3 april by examining 13 chinese studies and 5960 hospitalized covid-19 patients with a pooled smoking prevalence of 65  95  ci 4982  36 on that date we presented for the first time a hypothesis about the potential beneficial effects of nicotine which was subsequently expanded 37 while there were limitations in the study analysis mainly due to the inability to adjust for confounding factors the findings of low smoking prevalence among hospitalized covid-19 patients in china were consistent across all studies and in agreement with case series from usa 3839 the original hypothesis was based on the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system acknowledging that the disease appeared to involve a dysregulation of the immune response to viral invasionit is obviously inappropriate to suggest that anyone should initiate smoking or to continue to smoke due to the well-established smoking-related morbidities and the large number of potentially toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke furthermore it is unlikely that any other compound in tobacco cigarette smoke besides nicotine would be implicated to the potential benefits observed in smokers moreover due to the adverse effects of smoking and the fact that many smokers would suffer from co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease copd etc it is expected that the potential benefits of nicotine would be blunted when observed in smokersnicotine is a cholinergic agonist therefore it is an important inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokines acting through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via 7-nachrs nicotine inhibits tnf il-1 il-6 and hmgb1 while it does not inhibit anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 li et al 2011 28 in vivo animal models found nicotine to be protective against lipopolysaccharide-induced ards by reducing leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ni et al 2011 mabley et al 2011 such effects are relevant to covid-19 since cytokine storm appears to be the hallmark in severe cases 4041 several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-2 il-6 il-17 il-8 tnf and ccl2 are elevated in covid-19 patients 42 treatment with anti-il-6 anti-tnf medications has been proposed and clinical trials are already underway 4344 however it may be more effective to inhibit several instead of selectively one cytokine while some cytokine inhibitors are associated with elevated risk of opportunistic infections 45 also it is possible that measuring blood levels of inflammatory cytokines does not accurately reflect the extent of the immune imbalance that exists locally in the lungs in any case the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system provides better control and modulation of the cytokine response compared to blocking a single agent and nicotine could effectively contribute to maintaining a balanced immune response against viral infection therefore it is possible that the clinical manifestations of cytokine storm in covid-19 patients are the result of dysfunction of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathwaysars-cov-2 is known to use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor for cell entry 46 ace2 has well-established vasodilatory anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties studies on smoking and ace2 are contradictory studies published before the covid-19 pandemic reported that smoking and nicotine down-regulate ace2 4748 however more recent studies suggest that they up-regulate ace2 49 50 51 there is currently no evidence to suggest that up-regulation of ace2 is associated with increased covid-19 susceptibility or severity in fact up-regulation of ace2 appears to be protective against tissue damage caused by sars-cov-2 ace2 has been found to protect mice from developing ards 52 53 54 data from sars experimental studies suggest that continuous sars-cov-2 infection and replication induces immediate down-regulation of ace2 that may be implicated in organ damage and disease severity 55 further support for the beneficial role of ace2 comes from data that estrogens appear to up-regulate ace2 while children and younger adults have higher ace2 levels compared to older people 5657 at the same time women children and young people have milder covid-19 symptoms if accurate and verified the recently-observed ace2 up-regulation in smokers is probably induced as a defence mechanism to counteract the effects of angiotensin ii there is probably a dynamic balance between ace and ace2 which is continuously changing depending on stressors and stimuli thus there is uncertainty on whether nicotine affects covid-19 progression through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and there is no known interaction between ace2 and nachr receptorsimportantly ace2 is expressed in several regions in the brain the regions where vagal afferent fibers terminate and vagal efferent fibers originate exhibit ace2 expression 5859 neuroinvasion is a common feature of coronaviruses 60 anosmia and ageusia have been reported by covid-19 patients 61 sars-cov-2 may enter the cns either through the blood stream or via the olfactory nerve across the cribriform plate 6263 a case series of 214 patients reported that 364  had neurological manifestations 64 thus it is possible that the virus might infect the terminal areas of vagus afferent fibers or the origin of vagus efferent fiber causing down-regulation of ace2 and resulting in local inflammation that could disrupt the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and dysregulate the inflammatory response nicotine could have protective properties against possible brain inflammation caused by sars-cov-2 mediated through 7-achrs 65a noteworthy parameter relative to anosmia and ageusia observed among covid-19 patients is that these are characteristic and prodromal non-motor manifestations of parkinsons disease 6667 while ageusia has not been extensively studied olfactory disturbance is a very common feature observed in up to 95  of parkinsons disease patients 67 and this symptom may appear several years before the onset of motor symptoms there is no olfactory improvement with dopamine agonists 6869 unlike the general population where smoking is associated with impaired olfactory function smokers with parkinsons disease experience less decline in olfactory sense compared to non-smokers suggesting a protective effect of smoking sharer et al 2015 this is explained by the fact the phenomenon has been linked to impairment of cholinergic transmission 70 while nicotine improved the olfactory impairment in a mouse model of parkinsons disease 71 the olfactory bulb has a rich network of nachrs but 7 nachrs may also be expressed on the axon terminals of the olfactory receptor neurons 72 while this may suggest facilitated brain infection through anterograde transport along the olfactory nerve it is possible that olfactory receptor neurons may act as first-line viral sensors and initiate a rapid immune response 73 this would explain the mild symptoms in covid-19 patients with olfactory lossin any case anosmia may represent another sign of dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system in covid-19a prominent feature of covid-19 is coagulopathy that results in thromboembolic complications venous thromboembolism was reported in 25  of patients who were not under thromboprophylaxis and was associated with higher mortality rate 74 abnormal coagulation parameters were also associated with poor survival 75 although venous thromboembolism is a well-known risk factor of any serious infection additional mechanisms such as endothelial damage increased vascular permeability and microvascular occlusion may be implicated in covid-19 76 it is important to note that platelets express functional 7-achrs 77 while hematopoietic 7 nachr deficiency increases inflammation and platelet activity 78 recently acetylcholine was found to be an endogenous inhibitor of platelet activation 79 therefore dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system could be implicated in the thrombotic and vascular complications of covid-19the observation of a low prevalence of hospitalized covid-19 patients in china led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway 36 as more studies presented the clinical manifestations laboratory findings and disease progression in covid-19 patients it became apparent that the nicotinic cholinergic system could explain most if not all of the disease characteristics it would be unlikely for a single defence system to ameliorate all the diverse and complex manifestations of covid-19 unless that defence mechanism was the target of the viral host could that be possiblesars-cov-2 appears to have originated from a bat coronavirus ji et al 80 carried out comprehensive sequence analysis in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage bias and reported that the virus may have been a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an unknown-origin coronavirus 80 one possible intermediate host could have been a snake coronavirus taking into consideration that snake venom toxins are competitive antagonists of acetylcholine on 7-nach receptor with high affinity we decided to explore the hypothesis that sars-cov-2 may have acquired sequences by any of the potential and not defined yet intermediates through genomic recombination we compared the protein sequences between sars-cov-2 and snake venom neurotoxins we were able to identify regions with four or five amino acids homology between the coronavirus and several neurotoxin molecules eg sars-cov-2 compared with alpha bungarotoxin fig 1
a sars-cov-2 and alpha-cobratoxin fig 1btherefore we hypothesize that these sequences on the sars-cov-2 proteins being similar to the active sites of a neurotoxin can result in binding to nachrs and adversely affecting their function by preventing the action of acetylcholinenicotine could act as a competitive agonist for the nachrs that could restore the compromised function of the nicotinic cholinergic system this may be feasible through repurposing already approved for other indications pharmaceutical nicotine products such as nicotine patches for use by non-smokers or even by using these products as already indicated ie as smoking substitutes among current smokers these products are available over-the-counter in most countries they have been administered therapeutically in non-smokers for neurological conditions and inflammatory bowel disease for larger periods than would be needed for covid-19 81 82 83 no abuse liability was observed in non-smokers despite being administerd for several weeks 8283 besides gums and patches nicotine can be administered though inhalation with the use of a nebulizer or other aerosol systems if necessary nicotine administration could be added on top of antiviral or other therapeutic options for covid-19 by restoring and re-activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway a more universal suppression of the cytokine storm could probably be achieved compared to administering inhibitors of a single cytokine the potential need to provide pharmaceutical nicotine products to smokers and users of other nicotine products who experience abrupt withdrawal symptoms of nicotine when hospitalized for covid-19 or aim to follow medical advice to quit smoking should also be examined additionally if the hypothesis about the beneficial effects of nicotine is valid smokers who quit nicotine use when hospitalized will be deprived from these benefits in france the addiction prevention network respadd officially recommends the use of nicotine replacement therapies for smokers when hospitalized for any illness 84 clinical trials will dictate future approaches and the role of nicotine in covid-19 while further experimental studies should examine the affinity of the virus to nachrsin conclusion we noticed that most of the clinical characteristics of severe covid-19 could be explained by dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system the observation that patients eventually develop cytokine storm which results in rapid clinical deterioration led to the development of a hypothesis about the series of events associated with adverse outcomes in covid-19 fig 2
once someone is infected with sars-cov-2 the immune system is mobilized as the virus replicates cell and viral debris or virions may interact with the nachrs blocking the action of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway if the initial immune response is not enough to combat the viral invasion at an early stage the extensive and prolonged replication of the virus will eventually block a large part the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway seriously compromising its ability to control and regulate the immune response the uncontrolled action of pro-inflammatory cytokines will result in the development of cytokine storm with acute lung injury leading to ards coagulation disturbances and multiorgan failure based on this hypothesis covid-19 appears to eventually become a disease of the nicotinic cholinergic system nicotine could maintain or restore the function of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system and thus control the release and activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines this could prevent or suppress the cytokine storm this hypothesis needs to be examined in the laboratory and the clinical settingnot applicablenot applicableno funding was provided for this study85 86 87the authors declare no conflict of interestthe coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid-19 that is spreading at the global scale is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 an enveloped single-stranded rna virus belonging to the coronaviridae family genus beta-coronavirus 1 non-structural proteins of this virus play a crucial role in virus replication while structural and auxiliary proteins are involved in morphogenesis and interfere with the host immunity response respectively 2accumulating evidence suggests that the host immunity response is contributing in severe forms of mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections 3 4 5 this immune response has been associated with a higher intensive care unit icu admissions and mortality in covid-19 in fact higher concentrations of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha mip1a and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf in comparison to non-icu patients were reported in patients with covid-19 5 in another study higher levels of interleukin-2 il-2 receptor interleukin-6 il-6 interleukin-8 il-8 interleukin-10 il-10 and tnf were found in deceased patients with covid-19 compared to patients who had recovered from the disease 6these immunologic reactions in severe covid-19 may characterize the cytokine storm that is associated with untoward clinicopathological consequences the cytokine storm is an out-of-control cytokine release that has been observed in some infectious and noninfectious diseases leading to a hyperinflammation condition in the host fig1
7 this uncontrolled cytokine response might be accompanied with more immune cells activation including t helper 17 cell th17 differentiation from cd4 lymphocytes in fact increased th17 responses were reported in mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 8 9 10 11at least 10 of the patients with severe covid-19 will eventually present lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and involvement of multiple organs within 8-14 days of the onset of their illness 12 these severe cases that develop respiratory failure show a series of pathological findings such as hyaline membrane formation inflammatory infiltration with multinucleated syncytial cells in their lung pathology and a burst of cytokine release leading to morbidity and mortality 6 12the initial cellular entry phase of the sara-cov-2 requires binding of its envelope homotrimeric spike glycoprotein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the target cell 12 13 the attachment of the virus with ace2 as its cellular receptor triggers internalization of the complex into the target cell leading to the down-regulation of the ace2 14ace2 internalization and its subsequent down-regulation would potentially result in unopposed function of angiotensin ii angii and decreased levels of angiotensin-1-7 14 since angiotensin-1-7 has a key counter-regulatory role in many of the angiotensin type 1 receptor at1r-related physiopathological functions the sara-cov-2-mediated downregulation of ace2 and the resulting increased overall ratio of ang ii to angiotensin-1-7 leads to the deterioration of the pulmonary function and lung injury 13 15therefore the imbalance of ace2ace levels in covid-19 and the dysregulated angiotensin-ii at1r axis of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas may partially be responsible for the cytokine storm and the resulting pulmonary damage 16 17 the loss of the modulatory effect of angiotensin-1-7 via its binding to the mas receptor masr that attenuates inflammatory response may be a further contributing factor to the hyper-inflammation status of severe cases of covid-19beyond ace2 catalytic activity in raas and masr-mediated actions it has interesting effects on multiple molecular pathways which are involved in inflammatory response and cytokine release however potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of the cytokine storm in covid-19 have not yet been explored extensivelyin this review we specifically discuss the complex inflammatory molecular consequents of downregulation of ace2 in the context of sars-cov-2 with a particular emphasis on the complement system and des-arg9-bk or dabk in addition to ace angiotensin-iiat1r and ace2masr axes we propose a unifying molecular model to better understand the complex molecular events behind out-of-control cytokine response in severe covid-19 patients undoubtedly this insight will be pivotal to obtain a harmonized therapeutic strategy to confront this deadly viral infection and to protect the lungs during the cytokine stormthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas through its vasoactive peptides regulates blood pressure fluid volume sodium and potassium balance this elegant system also plays a significant role in the promotion and maintenance of inflammation 18it appears that activation of the raas system can induce inflammation in an independent mechanism of blood pressure through the at1 receptor at1r in the kidney and vasculature 19 the secretion of profibrotic cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta tfg- is stimulated during raas activation 20 21 22 furthermore increased production of ang ii and activation of at1r are accompanied with a pro-inflammatory response via activation of the complement cascade including c5a c5b-9 23 this implies a cross-talk between raas and the complement systemang ii can activate the nuclear factor kappa b nf-b pathway 24 25 via stimulation of the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of nf-b 26 this will lead to increased production of il-6 27 tnf il-1b and il-10 26 after at1r activation ang ii regulates mitogen-activated protein kinases mapk erk12 jnk p38mapk which have important functions on cellular processes including the release of cytokines such as il-1 il-10 il-12 and tnf fig2
 28 29 30ace2 enzyme is expressed in the heart kidneys testes gastrointestinal tract and lungs 15 31 it cleaves the angiotensin i ang i to generate the inactive ang-19 peptide which can be changed to the vasodilatory peptide ang-17 by ace or other peptidases ace2 can also directly metabolize ang ii to generate ang-1-7 32sars-cov-2 uses ace2 in type ii pneumocytes of lung alveoli and club cells in bronchioles as the cellular entry receptor very recently tmprss2 as a major host protease and ace2 co-expression was reported among a subset of type ii pneumocytes in the lung 31after the attachment of sars-cov-2 spike s-protein to ace2 its intracellular binding site down-regulates ace2 consequently following this down-regulation of ace2 ang ii level increases in the serum leading to augmentation of the ang iiat1r axis activation which is followed by trans-signaling of il-6-sil-6ra complex in which the gp 130-mediated activation of stat3 occurs in the lungs epithelial cells although sars-cov-2 itself activates nf-b through pattern recognition receptors it is the simultaneous activation of nf-b and stat3 that enhances nf-b activation machinery the il-6 amplifier this hyper-activation of nf-b via the il-6 amp in the lungs induces a cytokine storm with subsequent ards that had been observed in severe covid-19 patients 33 34indeed down-regulation of ace2 which was accompanied with enhancement of ang ii levels in different types of lung injury triggered those pulmonary pathological changes that are commonly observed in ards 35given the above premises it seems reasonable to speculate that depletion of ace2 and activation of aceangiotensin iiat1r axis might have a pivotal role in the clinical presentations of covid-19 in fact higher circulatory levels of ang ii were reported in covid-19 patients than the control subjects and these plasma levels of ang ii were linearly associated with lung injury 36 therefore in contrast to earlier clinical experts opinions raas inhibitors should not be discontinued in stable cases of covid-19 because the discontinuation of ace inhibitors and arbs may potentially have detrimental effects on these patients 14 37 38 in a recent study the first clinical evidence has shown that ace inhibitors or arb therapy in covid-19 patients with hypertension were associated with a lower rate of disease severity a trend toward lower il-6 levels and higher circulatory cd3 and cd4 t cells counts 39the protective effect of ace2 in severe acute lung failure has been shown in animal models 40 the accumulating clinical-epidemiological evidence about covid-19 implies that sars-cov-2 associated ace2 depletion is accompanied with a severe clinical course of disease in those clinical and epidemiological conditions that jeopardize the levels of ace2 expression including older age male sex and medical conditions diabetes mellitus hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and obesity 41 42 under these medical conditions the covid-19 infection-induced ace2 depletion could not overcome already exaggerated aceangiotensin iiat1r axis activity hence administration of recombinant soluble ace2 to patients with severe covid-19 infection may be a therapeutic modality however it is worthwhile to consider targeting downstream of aceangiotensin iiat1r axis such as il-6-stat3 axis 34 to combat the observed cytokine storm in covid-19 in order to prevent lung inflammation and end organ damageace2 ang-1-7 and ang-1-7 receptor mas are the constituents of the other arm of the ras system which counteracts and attenuates the effects of ace-ang ii-at1r axis 43 44 ace2 derives vasodilatory peptide ang-1-7 from ang ii following a cleavage activity this vasodilatory peptide has anti-proliferative anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities 45 46 47ang-1-7 reduces the expression of p38 mapk and nf-b and inflammatory factors such as il-6 tnf and il-8 48 49 50 51 thus ang-1-7 per se has an anti-inflammatory effect and ameliorates inflammatory damages as revealed in several animal studies 52 53 it has been shown that ang-1-7 reduces inflammatory cardiac injury in diabetic hypertensive rats 52 and glomerular involvement in mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis mpgn rat models 53the protection of vascular endothelium and renal tubular cells diuresis and vasodilation-dependent ang-1-7 effects occur via masr 54 55 mas receptors express in the epithelium and bronchial smooth muscle therefore ang 1-7 could modulate acute and chronic inflammatory processes in the lung via activation of masr 56 a range of physiological effects of ang- 1-7 is present in different tissues such as heart brain and kidney by its action on masr 57ang-1-7 also attenuates ang ii induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 icam-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 vcam-1 and mcp1 expression by masr activation leading to inhibition of the p38mapk and nf-b pathways 58erk 12 pathway modulates production of il-10 59 that induces differentiation of t-helper toward th2-type th-2 regulates immune responses by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like il-4 il-5 il-9 and il-13 60 additionally il-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that may be involved in the prevention of tissue damage 61 62 ang-1-7 modulates the activity of erk 12 fig2 63 64 65therefore ang-1-7 has an anti-inflammatory function via modulation of nf-b mapk and erk 12 pathways hence it may be proposed that sars-cov-2 associated suppression of ace2 which would be accompanied with reduction of all mas receptor-mediated functions leads to accentuation of the cytokines release and frank inflammatory responses because ang-1-7 exerts a critical role in counteracting the pro-inflammatory effect of raas protecting from endothelial cell activation and resulting lung damage from inflammatory mediators in the cytokine storm the administration of ang-1-7 or one of its similar agents to patients with covid-19 pneumonitis has been suggested 35 66the kinin-kallikrein system includes kininogen kallikrein enzyme bradykinin bk-1-9 or bk and des-arg9-bk or dabk 67 68 the active products of this system interact with two distinct g-protein coupled receptors the bradykinin b1 receptor bkb1r and bradykinin b2 receptor bkb2r the main ligand of bkb1r is dabk and the ligand of bkb2r is bk 69 70 bkb1r could hardly be detected in peripheral tissues in normal states however it is expressed on the cell types involved in inflammation therefore it is an inducible pro-inflammatory receptor 71 the expression of bkb1r as a specific receptor of bradykinin pathway is highly sensitive to inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide lps and interleukins 70 72 73 74 it is also up-regulated by cytokines such as il-1b and tnf 75 76 77 il-2 ifn epidermal growth factor egf and oncostatin increase the rate of bkb1r receptor mediated response 77 78 79 80 it should be mentioned that il-1b and tnf-induced bkb1r expression is related to nf-b activity 81 sodhi et al82 showed that activation of bkb1r enhances the neutrophil attraction to tissue by release of chemokine c-x-c motif chemokine 5 cxcl5 activity of this receptor leads to expression of fgf-2 83 and to increased levels of il-1b 84 and mcp1 fig3
 85dabk is a known pulmonary inflammatory factor 86 87 88 89 it is interesting that ace2 also cleaves terminal residue of dabk 90 91 this reaction results in deactivation of dabk therefore it could be postulated that covid-19-induced reduction of ace2 activity would be accompanied with increased activity of dabk and the resulting accentuation of the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leading to increased cytokine release hence targeting the ace2 dabk bradykinin b1 receptor axis has been suggested by some authors 92 93 to prevent or control ards in patients with severe covid-19 although several bkb1 antagonists have passed phase ii clinical trials none have been approved yet for clinical use 71the complement system is an ancient system that contributes to innate immune response this system includes many proteins and cleavage products that plays a key functional role in defense against microorganisms including viruses the viral inactivation by the complement cascade involves virus uptake and clearance by phagocytic cells coating virions resulting in prevention of attachment with their receptors virus lysis by pore formation and destruction of its membrane by membrane attack complex formation c5b-9 94following viral-induced complement cascade activation inflammatory processes are promoted complement factor 5a c5a is the strongest inflammatory peptide in the complement cascade that induces release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 95 96 97 98  c5a can also induce secretion of tnf- 99 100 terminal products of the complement cascade can induce the production of cytokines such as tnf- and il-1 98 101 102 103 104 terminal complement component c5b-9 induces release of il-6 via activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor nf-b and activator protein-1 ap-1 105 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp1 from vascular smooth muscle cells 106 also the increased production of c3a leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and tnf- 107the involvement of the complement system in the pathogenesis of syncytial virus infection mers-cov and sars-cov has been examined in several studies 108 109 110 the hyper activation of complement components including c5a in sera and c5b-9 in lungs was observed in mers-cov-infected hdpp4-transgenic mice the lung and spleen-induced pathological damages and inflammatory responses were alleviated through blockade of the c5ac5ar axis in those transgenic mice 110gralinski et al 109 showed that mice models deficient in c3c3-- loads in the lung had milder sars-cov induced pathologic features such as better respiratory function lower weight loss reduced pathologic findings in respiratory system and lower circulatory and tissue cytokines and chemokines despite equal lung viral loads compared to the controls these results showed that although the complement system had no role in virus replication activation of complement system in the lungs of sars-cov infected mice might lead to immune mediated damages in the lungs 109the complement cascade can be activated by the lectin pathway fig4
 by priming the immune system and enhancing clearances of viruses and virus-infected cells 111  the lectin pathway may also be involved in covid-19 pathogenesis recently gao et al 108 reported in a very interesting study the involvement of complement cascade aberrant activation in the pathogenesis of sarsmers-cov or sars-cov-2 via viral nucleocapsid n protein-mediated masp-2 auto-activation and binding to mannose-binding lectin mlb masp-2 is the main serine protease in the lectin pathway that induces downstream complement cascade via the mlb pathway resulting in accelerated inflammatory responses and lung damages in another arm of the aforementioned study the contribution of sars-cov-2 n protein in activation of the complement cascade was investigated in lungs of patients who expired with covid-19 not only were deposition of the complement components including c3 c3a and c5b-9 observed in lung autopsies but elevated circulatory levels of c5a were also reported in severe cases of covid-19 108magro et al 112 reported a pauci-inflammatory changes and lack of viral cytopathic effects accompanied with heavy deposition of c5b-9 c4d and mbl-masp2 in lung septal vasculatures of 5 patients with covid-19-induced respiratory failure indicative of unrestrained activation of the alternative and lectin cascades in these patientsgiven the above animal and clinical studies it is tempting to target the components of complement in severe covid-19 a promising clinical response including increased lung oxygenation and alleviation of systemic inflammation was reported in two patients with covid-19 who received an anti-c5a antibody 108c5a as the most potent complement derived mediator of inflammation in response to infections increases production of il-6 tnf and il-1 from toll-like receptor tlr-2 tlr-4 tlr-9 stimulated macrophages 113 114 however the c5a-c5r axis inhibition by the available pharmaceutical agents would be partial and the activity of residual terminal complement components might remain therefore targeting the upstream activators of the complement cascade such as c3a-c3ar axis may be more effective in restraining the uncontrolled complement pathway activation in severe covid-19 115 very recently the compstatin-based complement c3 inhibitor amy-101 was administered to a patient with ards due to covid-19 in which very good clinical responses with a high level of safety were reported 116the overall clinical benefits of targeting the c3a-c3arc5a-c5ar axis in order to control maladaptive immune-inflammatory consequences of the complement pathways in severe covid-19 remains to be clarified in the near futurethe covid-19 cytokine storm like the other cytokine storms in infectious and non-infectious conditions may be considered as a complex network the complex network of the cytokine response was described by tisoncik et al 7 as a series of overlapping networks each with a degree of redundancy and with alternative pathwaysour aforementioned pathogenesis of the so-called covid-19 cytokine storm through the four described distinct axes clarified that this cytokine storm complex network has many components which might cross-talk with each other in multiple known and unknown interfaces these interactions in a network state imply the complex nature of the covid-19 cytokine storm the dynamic equilibrium of the network components could be disturbed at multiple sites to emerge an untoward behavior in covid-19 cytokine storm this perturbation is initiated via attachment of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to its receptor ace2 followed by the aceang iiat1r axis activation leading to hyper-activation of nf-b by il-6 stats axis 34 in the normal dynamic equilibrium state the aceang iiat1r axis activation is counterbalanced by ace2masr axis and production of ang-1-7 that reduces the expression of p38 mapk and nf-b and inflammatory factors such as il-6 tnf and il-8 49 50 51 however sars-cov-2 associated down-regulation of ace2 suppresses these immunomodulatory effects leading to accentuation of the cytokine release responsewe currently know that dabk is a pulmonary inflammatory factor whose deactivation by ace2 is deranged by covid-19-induced reduction of ace2 activity this derangement is followed by ace2 dabk bradykinin b1 receptor axis activation that creates a pro-inflammatory synergistic effect for sars-cov-2 associated aceang iiat1r axis activation the resulting effect would be a more inflammatory state neutrophil recruitment and enhancement of pathological pulmonary changes that are observed in ards of severe covid-19we have already discussed the involvement of the complement system in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 via its nucleocapsid n protein-mediated masp-2 auto-activation and binding to mlb in the lectin arm of c3a-c3arc5a-c5ar axis 108 however the increased production of ang ii and activation of at1r may be accompanied with pro-inflammatory response via activation of the complement cascade including c5a c5b-9 23 this implies a cross-talk between aceangiotensin iiat1r axis and the complement systemsimilar to other complex networks elements from the complex network of the covid-19 cytokine storm may experience much cross-talk with elements from known and unknown pathways and networks for example ang ii as an element from aceang iiat1r induces tgf- expression 22 117 tgf- has a role in the differentiation of t helper 17 cells from naive cd4 t-cells th-17 cells generate il-17 gm-csf il-21 and il-22 il-17 itself promotes the production of a vast amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 8 118 il-17 was among the cytokines that were significantly correlated with the lung injury murray score and disease severity in covid-19 119 an increment of the highly pro-inflammatory ccr6 th17 in cd4 t cells was reported in covid-19 associated with ards 9 therefore targeting il-17 and t helper 17 responses in the cytokine storm of covid-19 have been suggested 8 118from a unifying point of view systems medicine approaches are required to understand the interactions among the different elements of the complex network of the covid-19 cytokine storm undoubtedly the clarification of hierarchy of the components of this complex network across different organizational levels will expand our armamentarium of treatments to tackle covid-19therapeutic plasma exchange is a well-known therapeutic option that can be considered in the treatment of autoimmune diseases the beneficial effect of this modality works through elimination of autoantibodies complement components immune complexes and cytokines therefore this option may be valuable in the treatment of severe covid-19 120 however application of this therapeutic modality is a general approach to confront the cytokine storm hence other approaches may be considered in the treatment of the covid-19 driven cytokine storm in order to protect lungs from injury table 1
according to the aforementioned axes which may be involved in the cytokine storm of severe cases of covid-19 some potential targets could be considered as therapeutic optionsthe first one is recombinant human ace2 there are some trials regarding the efficacy and safety of this agent in clinicopathological settings related to ace2 decrement such as congestive heart failure chf 121 ards 122 123 and lung injury due to viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus rsv 124 the reported findings about safety and efficacy were promising very recently monteil et al125 reported that human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 can prevent entry of sars-c0v-2 to the human blood vessel organoid and human kidney organoid this finding may suggest a highly compelling therapeutic intervention to protect lung injury in covid-19we suggested ace2bradykinindabk may be involved in the inflammatory response of sars cov-2 therefore blockade of this axis by inhibiting bkb1r may ameliorate a part of the cytokine storm which occurs in covid-19 infection lf22-0542 safotibant is a bkb1r antagonist with promising anti-inflammatory results 126 127 several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of this drug in multiple medical settings they have had promising results fig3 71regarding the pivotal role of the complement system in the cytokine storm and activation of th-17 every effort should be made to suppress the activation of this elegant cascade c5a as a potent component of this system is a good target for alleviation of pro-inflammatory responses to severe covid-19 eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody with high affinity to c5 near its cleavage site 128 this agent prevents the formation of c5a and c5b-9 it has been reported that this monoclonal antibody has beneficial effects in the treatment of diseases where their pathogenesis are based on complement activation 129 in a preliminary study conducted by gao et al 108 two patients with severe covid-19 received anti-c5a antibodies although the final effect of this type of therapeutic modality remains to be published the two patients showed dramatic clinical responses 108c3 blockade is another component of the complement system that can be targeted compstatin is a cyclic inhibitor of c3 cleavage 129 that may be considered in severe covid-19 complement receptor1 cr1 is a cofactor to inactivate c3b and c4b and inhibits the activation of c3 through all active pathways the recombinant form of soluble cr1 is developed which can block complement activation in serum samples from patients with c3-glomerulonephritis fig4 130in conclusion accumulating evidence suggests that sars-cov-2 driven ace2 down-regulation leads to an array of complex and intertwined molecular interactions via at least four axes consisting of dysregulation of the aceangiotensin iiat1r axis attenuation of ace2masr axis increased activation of ace2bradykinin b1rdabk axis and activation of the complement cascades resulting in the observed cytokine storm in severe covid-19the elucidation of molecular events of the aforementioned axes which might be involved in the pathogenesis of ards and lung injury in fulminant infections with sars-co-v-2 will promise novel therapeutic options for prevention or attenuation of the inflammatory cytokine release response that are observed nowadays in patients with severe covid-19mm in jr sf and mk interpreted and wrote the manuscript in and mm supervised the study all authors read and approved the final manuscriptthe authors declare the following financial interestspersonal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests an award was given to iraj nabipour by novo nordisk pars the best innovator of diabetes in iran 2013 for the remaining authors none were declaredcovid-19 was first detected in the city of wuhan china in december 2019 and the world health organization who declared a public health emergency following the spread of the virus and the possibility of a pandemic worldwide 1 this virus was first transmitted to humans through infected animals ie bats and pangolins and then spread around the world however there are still many ambiguities in this regard 2 the transmission rate of covid-19 is reportedly very high and each infected person can affect an average of 38 individuals mortality rates in patients with covid-19 have also been very variable and influenced by a variety of factors such as age and the presence of underlying diseases 3the other two members of the coronavirus cov family are sars-cov and mers-cov that can similarly cause respiratory disorders in humans in the same way as sars-cov-2 4 moreover sars-cov and sars-cov-2 can infect their target cells via ligation to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the entry receptor 5 however more recent studies have indicated that basigin bsg also called cluster of differentiation 147 cd147 or emmprin dendritic cell dc-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 icam-3-grabbing nonintegrin dc-sign known as cd209 and cd209l also labeled l-sign can act as receptors for sars-cov-2 6 7 8 it should be noted that ace2 in the human lung is highly expressed on the surface of alveolar type ii epithelial cells ecs and it can be considered as an appropriate host for sars-cov-2 9 besides other types of cells such as immune cells including macrophages and monocytes can express ace2 less than alveolar type ii ecs and as a result they can be attacked by sars-cov-2 10 however there is no accurate information on how other immune cells such as t-cells a type of lymphocytes and dcs are infected following sars-cov-2 infection dysregulated inflammatory responses infiltration of neutrophils monocytes and macrophages as well as uncontrolled release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are taken into account as critical factors in the development of severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or mof 11 12 13 14 several studies have correspondingly demonstrated a significant increase in il-6 serum levels in patients suffering from covid-19 15 16 17 this cytokine as an inflammatory mediator also plays an essential role in innate and adaptive immune responses though it can also have protective and anti-inflammatory properties in some pathologic states 18 19 20 furthermore regarding the findings of recent studies il-6 and its receptors could be high potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in covid-19 patients 21 hence in this review article the latest findings on the role of il-6 in the pathogenesis of covid-19 as well as therapeutic perspectives were summarized and discussedto date almost ten members of the il-6 family have been identified including il-6 il-11 il-27 il-31 cardiotropin-1 ct-1 leukemia inhibitory factor lif oncostatin m osm cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 clcf1 ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf and neuropoietin np 22 the il-6 gene is located on chromosome 7 in humans 23 this small single-chain phosphorylated glycoprotein consists of mainly four-helix bundles including a b c and d in which a and b helices run in one direction while c and d cases run on the opposite direction 24 there is another helix between c and d namely e helix located outside the a b c and d bundle signals of il-6 also transmit via a signal-transducing component ie glycoprotein 130 also known as gp130 which is a part of the il-6 receptor il-6r cd126 80 kda moreover il-6r is made up of three domains that is d1 d2 and d3 the d1 or immunoglobulin ig domain is connected to d2 and d3 as cytokine binding domains cbds the n-terminal of gp130 also consists of 6 domains ie d1-d6 besides soluble il-6r sil-6r and membrane-bound il-6r mil-6r are two identified forms of il-6r as well neutrophils t-cells monocytes and hepatocytes express mil-6r whereas sil-6r is produced following proteolytic cleavage of mil-6r via a disintegrin as well as metallopeptidase domain 10 adam10 and adam17 additionally alternative splicing of il-6r messenger ribonucleic acid mrna can produce sil-6r 25 which is capable of transporting il-6 to different parts of the body furthermore a hexameric complex comprised of two il-6sil-6rgp130 heterodimers is responsible for physiological and pathological functions 24both mil-6r and sil-6r can also transmit il-6 signals via classical and trans-signaling pathways respectively different biological consequences can even occur following ligation of il-6 to the cbd domains of these types of receptors as well as gp130 based on the location of gp130 26 moreover leukocytes and hepatocytes can express both the mil-6r and gp130 that initiate anti-inflammatory responses through the classical signaling pathway while pro-inflammatory responses are started in all cells to express gp130 via the trans-signaling pathway 27 three possible signaling pathways are thus initiated due to the activation of janus kinase jak with the hexameric complex ie two il-6il-6rgp130 heterodimers including signal transducer and transcription-3 stat3 mitogen-activated protein kinases mapk and phosphoinositol-3 kinase pi3k protein kinase b pkb also known as akt pathways as well as nuclear factor-b nf-b 24 in the pi3k pathway pkb can also stimulate the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor resulting in the activation of stat3 28 moreover evidence has revealed that stimulation of pkbakt mapk stat3 and nf-b prompts a wide range of inflammatory responses and pathological states in different disorders such as severe pneumonia and ards 2930 fig 1
 accordingly il-6 can act as a double-edged sword in different conditions depending on the activated signaling pathwayil-6 is known as a pleiotropic cytokine produced and secreted by a wide range of immune and non-immune cells such as dcs mast cells monocytes macrophages keratinocytes mesangial cells fibroblasts vascular endothelial cells ecs as well as t and b lymphocytes following infections or tissue damage 3132 evidence in this field has established that il-6 participates in critical cellular events such as cell proliferation differentiation survival and trafficking in this context il-6 acts as a double-edged sword affecting the activation and regulation of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses 33 the biological effects of il-6 on other cells as well as immune responses can be accordingly divided into two main categories effects on innate and adaptive immunity concerning innate immunity il-6 stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides amps and also acute phase proteins apps 3435 for instance il-6 stimulates the production of c-reactive protein crp in the liver through activating jaks 36 il-6 can similarly enhance monocyte differentiation into macrophages via stimulating colony-stimulating factor 1 csf1 production 37 moreover it can modulate the maturation of dcs by activating the stat3 signaling pathway in a negative manner 38 once pathogens enter the body their pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules pamps are also detected through innate immune receptors these cellular sensors are called pattern recognition receptors prrs including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors nlrs toll-like receptors tlr1 to tlr13 dna sensors absent in melanoma two also known as aim-2 and cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate gmp-amp synthase label led as cgas and rna sensors ie retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 mda-5 3940 in viral infections these different immune cellular pathogen recognition receptors are also able to detect and to bind to different viral pamps and activate transcription factor of il-6 and other inflammatory cytokines increasing production of these cytokines 41 in adaptive immunity il-6 has a wide range of activities for example in humoral immunity it can augment production of igg through regulating il-21 expression 42 moreover il-6 plays a critical role in differentiating naive t cd4 lymphocytes this cytokine also stimulates the production of il-4 by t cd4 and inhibits t helper type 1 th1 differentiation which can lead to th2 stimulation another mechanism leading to th2 differentiation is inhibition of interferon-gamma ifn- production by t cd4 identified as an essential cytokine in th1 differentiation 4344 on the other hand il-6 and tumor growth factor-beta tgf- can together differentiate naive t cd4 into th17 cells to produce il-17 in different pathological states 45 additionally cd8 t-cells namely cytotoxic t lymphocytes or ctls playing a significant role in anti-tumor and anti-viral defense can be stimulated and activated by the synergistic effect of il-6 il-7 and il-15 46 another essential function of il-6 is to be involved in trafficking of leukocytes especially neutrophils which is most commonly seen in infections 47 in some cases this cytokine along with other inflammatory cytokines is able to trigger a cytokine storm and lead to tissue damage that occurs through dysregulation of immune responses and mechanisms 48 one other adverse function of il-6 disrupting the effective immune response in viral infections as well as cancers is increased expression of inhibitory molecules such as programmed cell death protein 1 pd-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 pdl-1 49 in the case of viral infections elevated levels of il-6 in patients have been thus positively correlated with increased replication of the virus and persistence of the viral infection 50previous studies showed that during a viral infection il-6 overexpressed and it can have potentially adverse effects on the immune responses against the virus evidence suggests that an imbalance in the il-6 production can affect three main subjects in viral infection first virus clearance second virus persistence and spread and finally chronic viral infection il-6 can also stimulate the differentiation of th0 cells to th2 by activating the stat3 signaling pathway and ultimately production of the th2 cytokines such as il-4 and il-13 as well as the suppressor of cytokine signaling one protein socs-1 the socs-1 as an inhibitory molecule through its impacts on stat1 phosphorylation is capable of impairing the production of ifn- and il-2 resulting in decline levels of these cytokines by th1 cells 51 on the other hand increased il-6 and eventually socs-1 by interfering with the phosphorylation of stat4 have an inhibitory effect on the ifn-ii and ifn- production mentioned ifns are involved in infected cells cytolysis via stimulation and activation of killer cells including nk and t cd8 cells one of the main mechanisms in the removal of virally infected cells is the progression of the apoptotic pathways and their associated molecules by pro-apoptotic molecules such as granzyme b which is produced and secreted by killer cells 52 according to the described mechanism the survival of infected cells could be affected by il-6 because this multifunction cytokine can induce anti-apoptotic molecules expression via stimulation of th17 differentiation and il-17 production 52 another mechanism for developing the virus is the il-6 and ifn-i collaboration these cytokines increase the survival of the infected cell through an elevation of inhibitory molecules expression such as pd-l1 cd274 on the surface of the infected cell ligation of pdl-1 with pd-1 cd279 on t cd8 cells prevents apoptosis induced by these cells 5253recent studies show a positive and significant correlation between serum viral load and il-6 levels in patients with severe covid-19 and this viral load is associated with ards severity and lung tissue damage 70 all evidence suggests a possible destructive role for il-6 in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 71 shock and organ failure in several organs such as the kidneys heart lungs and liver are severely damaged by cytokine storms caused by an increase in inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-1 tnf- il-8 il-2 il-17 g-csf gm-csf cxcl10 ccl2 ccl3 in patients with covid-19 14 these cytokines can also cause extensive pulmonary damage through the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissue leading to the development of hyaline membranes and diffuse thickening of the alveolar barrier and ultimately diffuse alveolar damage 72 lymph node necrosis and spleen atrophy have also been reported in covid-19 patients which is discussed in the next section 73one of the most important and reliable indicators in the diagnosis of patients with covid-19 is a lymphopenia which is characterized by a significant reduction in b and t lymphocytes and this lymphopenia is directly related to the severity of the disease and the hospitalization of patients many factors and mechanisms could be involved in the development of lymphopenia but in patients with covid-19 damage to the spleen and lymph nodes as well as an increase in inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 appear to cause apoptosis of lymphocytes and a decrease in their number 7475 another role of il-6 in the occurrence of leukopenia and weakening the immune system is to reduce the number of major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii mhc-ii molecules on the surface of monocytes resulting in monocyte hyperactivation uncontrolled production of il-6 and lymphopenia 76 it has been shown that il-6 is able to decrease hla-dr expression on the cd14 monocytes and its circulatory level is inversely related to the expression of hla-dr 76 on the other hand a study reported that the addition of anti-il-6r monoclonal antibody tocilizumab in the plasma-enriched medium of cells partially improved the expression of hla-dr on the surface of monocytes and total lymphocyte counts of six covid-19 patients elevated following treatment with tocilizumab 77besides cd68cd169 macrophages that express ace2 have been detected in the marginal zone of the spleen as well as in lymph nodes marginal sinuses inside these types of macrophages the nucleoprotein antigen of sars-cov-2 is found additionally these macrophages can produce excessive il-6 concentrations infected tissues with sars-cov-2 also express fas molecule and it seems that mentioned macrophages can be involved in viral extension uncontrolled inflammation and initiation of lymphocytes death in patients with covid-19 73based on the evidence it appears that the link between inflammation and coagulation is not limited to vascular thrombotic disorders but can also occur in disorders such as vascular thrombotic disease as well as a wide range of severe infections leading to multiple organ failure and even deathpro-inflammatory cytokines considered as the leading players in inflammation-induced activation of coagulation it has been shown that il-1 and tnf- have anti-coagulant properties while il-6 can stimulate coagulation cascades following inflammatory responses via interfering in the generation of tissue factor and finally thrombin production 78 79 80 thrombin participates in different mechanisms including clot formation and enhances inflammation via proteinase-activated receptor-1 par-1 physiological anti-coagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor antithrombin iii and the protein c system are responsible for the regulation of thrombin production and all these regulators impaired following a hyper-inflammation condition a result of this imbalance between pro-coagulant molecules and anti-coagulant molecules leads to micro thrombosis diffused intravascular coagulation and eventually multi-organ dysfunction in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection 1781given the mentioned observations it is clear that il-6 plays an essential role in viral respiratory diseases such as covs or influenza and can be considered as a potential diagnostic biomarker and a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of these types of viral infections fig 2
a humanized anti-il-6 receptor mab or tocilizumab has been approved by the food and drug administration fda for the treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia and ra 82 in this line several studies on patients affected with covid-19 had revealed that tocilizumab could effectively improve clinical symptoms and also prevent disease development 83 84 85 86 87 therefore the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 treatment can be beneficial and more studies will probably be done on this mab soon however in several case reports contradictory findings have been obtained as a result of tocilizumab prescribing some of which are mentioned in this sectionas mentioned before tocilizumab in patients with severe covid-19 was related to a considerable reduction of inflammatory mediators satisfactory alterations of ct findings and condensed ventilatory care supplies 8889 tocilizumab clinical outcomes have an optimistic effect if used in the primary phase of sars-cov2-dependent pneumonia along with severe respiratory syndrome 90 the hyper-inflammatory state caused by covid-19 may be improved by the pro-inflammatory condition of sickle cell disease and severe acute coronary syndrome in these patients tocilizumab appears to be effective and safe in children as well as in adults it has been reported that blood exchange transfusion and non-invasive ventilation as the routine treatments of the severe acute coronary syndrome could be used safe and effective 91 also in mechanically ventilated sars-cov-2 infected patients tocilizumab was accompanying a decline of death despite higher super-infection incidence 92 an interesting study on a case of multiple myeloma with sars-cov-2 infection showed that the patient underwent significant clinical recovery after tocilizumab therapy however this finding required randomized controlled trials to confirm its findings and to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab 93 tocilizumab therapy in an immunocompromised patient with covid-19 and a related hemophagocytic syndrome showed that cytokine storm and multi-organ dysfunction quickly reversed and on hospital day 30 the patient was breathing spontaneously with protective tracheotomy 94various reports indicate that in some cases treatment with tocilizumab has been problematic evidence showed that in patients with diabetes and non-diabetic ones hyperglycemia could interfere with tocilizumab therapy and optimal management of sars-cov-2 infection is not achieved during this pathologic state as a result it could be of interest to researchers and clinicians to achieve more effective outcomes by controlling hyperglycemia following tocilizumab therapy of patients with covid-19 95 another study reported that subsequently tocilizumab therapy serum triglycine levels increased significantly peaked on day 16 1436 mgdl through interfering with related metabolic pathways 96 although such observations in two enrolled cases cannot be generalized to all patients the clinicians should monitor the patient for hypertriglyceridemia tocilizumab therapy in an investigation two cases with covid-19 undertreatment with tocilizumab it was observed that both patients progressed to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh despite tocilizumab therapy and one patient also contracted viral myocarditisregarding the clinical outcomes in these patients tocilizumab safety and its clinical practicality should be more considered and be used with caution in patients with covid-19 97 the risk of intestinal perforation is another problem of patients with severe covid-19 which is undertreatment with tocilizumab since tocilizumab reduces the acute phase response intestinal perforation may not necessarily cause a remarkable rise of crp and may primarily go unobserved in sedated and ventilated patients 98 recently an investigation on patients with covid-19 revealed that serum level of il-6 increased initially and then reduced following tocilizumab therapy while in some patients a persistent rise of il-6 was detected and treatment was failed the results of this study suggest that tocilizumab therapy may be valid only in covid-19 patients with cytokine storms and in critically ill patients with higher levels of il-6 in a dose and time-dependent manner 99taken together it seems that tocilizumab therapy should be used only when the lung lesions progression confirmed by radiological and clinical manifestations furthermore deciding on the timing and dose of tocilizumab administration is also critical in increasing treatment success rate 100siltuximab as a high affinity humanmurine chimeric mab can bind to sil-6 and create a stable complex siltuximab avoids the binding of il-6 to both membrane and soluble forms of il-6 receptors and is used for the treatment of adult patients with multicentric castlemans disease which is accompanied by dysregulated production of il-6besides siltuximab could provide a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 and elevated il-6 levels in these patients an 11 mgkg intravenous infusion administered every three weeks was recommended to il-6 reduction however the researchers found that the effectiveness of a single dose was more significant due to the severity of sars infection as well as the half-life of siltuximab it also suggested that before siltuximab administration it is essential to approve that total neutrophil and platelet count be higher than 1  109 celll and 75  109l respectively 101 another study also demonstrated that siltuximab had a significant role in the treatment of covid-19 patients with ards 102regarding the presented data inhibition of il-6il-6r with siltuximab and tocilizumab need further assessment in handling the supposed hyper-inflammatory response mediated by severe sars-cov-2 infection these primary findings are considered hypothesis-generating and well-designed randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the outcomes 103previous studies aimed at treating inflammatory diseases have introduced a group of natural and synthetic compounds that are capable of inhibiting il-6 given the role of il-6 in the pathogenesis of covid-19 and the possibility of applying these inhibitory compounds in the future some of them have been introduced here based on their mechanism of action the inhibitory compounds that directly affect il-6 or its receptors can be divided into three main categories 1 il-6 inhibitors which include derivatives of 2378tetrahydro4aryl1hcyclopenteimdiazo12apyridin56hone diaryl pyridine diaryl pyrazine meta-terphenyl 1benzyl245triphenyl45dihydro1himidazole 2 il-6 production inhibitors including benzophenone chalcones 4styryl3cyanocoumarin indoline tricyclic andrographolide atractylenolide iii madindoline a and b chromone-isoxazolopyridine hybrids and bergenin derivatives and 3 il-6 receptor inhibitors such as epoxyresibufogenin-3-formate 24a phase i clinical trial study had concluded that cvl218 as a poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor had beneficial effects through inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication without any noticeable cytopathic consequences additionally as stated so far about covid-19 peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and cvl218 can suppress the production of the cpg-induced il-6 in these immune cells these findings have indicated that cvl218 has anti-inflammatory properties and it is also a potential agent in the treatment of covid-19 particularly in patients admitted to intensive care units icus 104the mechanism action of hcq is to inhibit lysosomal activity via increasing intracellular ph in b cells dcs and macrophages as antigen-presenting cells apcs 105 this process ultimately leads to a defect in the presentation of t-dependent antigens through mhc-ii enhancing the cd8 t-cell immune response and reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 by t- and b-cells 106 prescribing hcq in patients with covid-19 has thus confirmed that the given drug can have beneficial effects in terms of improving patients through increasing viral clearance as well as lowering the severity of pneumonia and duration of symptoms without any severe side effects 107108at the beginning of the epidemic and following the pandemic studies have shown that hcq can be useful in the treatment of covid-19 patients through increasing viral clearance as well as lowering the severity of pneumonia and the duration of symptoms in contrast after further studies and side effects observed in these patients the effectiveness of this drug has been questioned for instance recently an observational cohort study proposed that hcq either alone or in combination with azithromycin had not a survival advantage among hospitalized patients with covid-19 109 another meta-analysis also revealed that the administration of hcqcq had not any considerable impacts on sars-cov-2 clearance and even increased hospitalized patients with covid-19 mortality with a higher risk in covid-19 patients with comorbidities 110 in a randomized investigation from china in patients with a mild to moderate sars-cov-2 infection recovery rates was not valuable following hcq therapy 107 similarly another study from france on 11 hospitalized covid-19 patients also failed to approve hcq anti-viral effects when hcq administered combination with azithromycin 111a reason for the disagreement in the anti-viral effects of hcq between these clinical trials might be due to the dosage of hcq this is because prescribing high doses of hcq can increase side effects and disorders caused by the treatment especially when these side effects are not monitored the present prescribed dosage in covid-19 patient may be concerning the anti-malarial dosage of hcq therefore this issue should be more evaluated in the other viral infections such as sars-cov-2 112known as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compound thalidomide is capable of stimulating t-cells inhibit cell proliferation and reduce lung injury as well as pulmonary fibrosis the effects of thalidomide might be related to regulating immune responses and preventing the production of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 a case report in this line had found that thalidomide could lead to treating pneumonia in an infected case with sars-cov-2 113 therefore it may be possible to use this drug to treat patients suffering from covid-19small molecules termed jak inhibitors are a group of anti-inflammatory drugs that can inhibit jaks in inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways these drugs have also been utilized to treat ra and have shown positive effects 114115 for instance following treatment with baricitinib as a jak12 inhibitor significant improvements had been observed in the condition of ra patients due to interruption of the il-6 signaling pathway and modulation of inflammatory immune responses 116 recently a combination of baricitinib with anti-viral drugs such as remdesivir lopinavir and ritonavir has been used in patients with covid-19 and this novel compound has been able to reduce viral replication and infectivity and dysregulated host inflammatory responses 117the roots of curcuma longa l contain a biologically active dietary polyphenol ingredient called curcumin which has numerous therapeutic properties such as reducing inflammatory responses and helping to treat cancers as cited in previous studies 118 the mechanism action of curcumin as an il-6 signaling inhibitor is interacting with several targets such as jak2 stat3 pi3kakt and mapkerk adaptor molecules which are involved in il-6 signaling pathways 119120 and also reducing inflammatory cytokines such as nf-b il-6 and others 121 studies reported that conventional poly lactic acid pla-containing curcumin had a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect even at 18 dose ie 50 compared to 400 mgkg free curcumin with lower bioavailability 122 additionally a meta-analysis study showed that levels of il-6 could be reduced by curcumin supplementation through suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling pathways related to different inflammatory disorders 123 besides clinical trials that used curcumin as an anti-inflammatory compound demonstrated that it was safe tolerable and nontoxic in studied patients 33 due to the anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin as well as the naturalness of this substance it may be used as an adjunct therapy in patients with covid-19 however this theory needs further researchresveratrol 3540transtrihydroxystibene is considered as an anti-inflammatory polyphenol existing in peanuts grapes mulberries and red wine it has also been extensively studied as a possible therapeutic agent for the regulation of the immune system and inflammatory responses 124 resveratrol can also promote a powerful anti-inflammatory impact via its ability to antagonize the inflammatory cytokines of nf-b tnf- il-6 as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase inos activity 125126 although there are no data for using resveratrol in patients with covid-19 a study suggested that this natural polyphenol compound may be an adjunctive anti-viral agent to consider particularly regarding the findings of linn et al study that showed resveratrol at 250 and 125 m alleviated the monolayer destruction of the mers-cov infected vero e6 cells 127 although the dose of resveratrol in humans has not yet been determined its administration in supplemental doses can be considered safe for patients 128naringin shows a productive anti-inflammatory activity as reported in the present and previous studies 129 130 131 this flavanone glycoside can also constrain the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 and il-6 recently the results of an investigation revealed that the application of naringin 10 20 40 gml in lps-treated macrophage cells had anti-inflammatory effects and meaningfully reduced the expression of cox-2 inos il-1 and il-6 132 the mentioned study suggested that regarding the potential anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of flavonoids the citrus fruit or its derived phytochemicals such as naringin are hopeful in the use of prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 132 another experimental study showed that the administration of naringin at different doses 25 50 and 100 mgkg body weight of rats in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity had considerable anti-inflammatory effects 133recently a chinese herbal patent compound called lianhuaqingwen lh has been used to treat covid-19 considering its anti-inflammatory properties including inhibited production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il-6 il-1 tnf- cc motif chemokine ligand ccl2 as well as cxcl10 this substance has reduced the severity of symptoms in infected cases investigations have also shown that lh can reduce the replication of the sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells 134 in an experimental study on influenza-infected mice undertreatment orally administered 1300 and 650 mgkgday of lh solution twice a day at 12-h intervals for five days the findings showed that in the early stages of infection serum levels of il-6 tnf- cxcl8 il-8 cxcl10 and ccl2 were decreased significantly 135 given these results as well as the several similarities between the immunopathogenesis of influenza and sars-cov2 lh may be useful in the treatment of patients with covid-19previous studies have revealed that ljf radix scutellariae and fructus forsythiae plant species in traditional chinese medicine tcm has been extensively used as a drug for several inflammatory disorders interestingly this herbal preparation has effectively repressed the production of inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 tnf- ifn- via pbmcs and lipopolysaccharide lps-stimulated murine alveolar macrophages 136137 currently these herbal agents have been prescribed for patients with covid-19 and findings have confirmed their beneficial effects in the treatment of the patients 136138 however accurate information about patients the dosage used and treatment outcomes are not availableshenfu is known as a type of tcm that contains aconite and ginseng 139 following an infection systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs occurs that can lead to ards mof or even death 140 to explore the therapeutic impacts of sfi and its effect on nf-b activity in pbmcs a lipopolysaccharide lps-induced sris model was created it was observed that following injection of 10 mlkg sfi the plasma levels of il-6 had significantly reduced in sfi treated group compared with untreated animals additionally a histopathological observation had established that the lung tissue had alleviated in the sfi group 141 another study on sixty-eight patients with severe sepsis undertreatment with 100 ml sfi intravenous drip once a day for seven days showed that serum level of il-6 was remarkably decreased in the sfi treated group compared with the control group 142 therefore due to the similarity of pathological immune responses in covid-19 sirs sepsis and other inflammatory-based disorders as well as the beneficial effects of sfi in decreasing the symptoms of sirs this compound might be considered as a potential therapeutic target for patients with covid-19to conclude based on the available evidence reviewed in this article il-6 plays a crucial role in promoting inflammatory responses after being infected with sars-cov-2 most recent studies on patients with covid-19 have also reported that il-6 serum levels had elevated in infected cases on the other hand dysregulated inflammatory responses could cause lung injury leading to ards mof or even death also a pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 would increase the need for medications or healing compounds for the disease the use of drugs mabs and natural or synthetic anti-il-6il-6r may thus be a helpful strategy for treating or reducing the deadly side effects of covid-19 however extensive studies need to be fulfilled to achieve the best agent or combinationthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperin late 2019 a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in china that is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of the time of this writing almost seven million cases have been reported globally in a pandemic that will potentially affect billions despite being recognized only 6 months ago clinical information is rapidly becoming available covid-19 is most severe in older individuals and those with preexisting conditions in contrast for most children covid-19 appears to be mild or asymptomatic although it is still early in the pandemic and much information is preliminary there are sufficient data available to analyze the clinical manifestations and possible pathogenesis of covid-19 in the context of the damage-response framework drfthe drf represents a theory of microbial pathogenesis first proposed in 1999 which views host damage as the relevant outcome of host-microbe interactions and posits that host damage stems from microbial traits or the host immune response or both 1 in the drf the relationship between host damage and the immune response is represented by a simple upright parabola whereby host damage is plotted on the y axis as a function of the immune response ranging from weak on the left to strong on the right 2 the drf has been useful in advancing understanding of infectious diseases 1 and providing insight into infectious diseases that occur in the setting of weak or strong immune responses such as candidiasis and cryptococcosis 35 the drf has also informed our understanding of host susceptibility to infectious diseases 6 and can be a valuable tool for teaching microbial pathogenesis and infectious diseases 7according to the drf clinical signs and symptoms manifest themselves when host damage reaches a threshold that impairs homeostasis in covid-19 clinical symptoms range from a mild upper respiratory tract-like illness to a life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome 8 in the latter oxygenation is compromised by pulmonary inflammation a reflection of host damage coronaviruses damage infected cells and trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines which elicit inflammation that damages host cells and tissues locally and at a distance any inflammatory response in the lungs has the potential to cripple their primary function of gas exchange the pulmonary failure associated with severe cases of covid-19 is the result of lung damage caused by inflammation of the airways 9 although neurological mechanisms and thromboembolism are also contributing factors 10 11 while virus is likely to be present in the lungs lung damage from sars-cov-2 is most likely due to both viral and host factors although their relative contributions are currently unknownthe emergence of covid-19 was preceded by two other outbreaks of coronaviruses in 2003 and 2012 caused by sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov respectively these two viruses have been studied extensively in recent years until comparable information from studies of sars-cov-2 is available the experience with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov provides the most important clues to the pathogenesis of the severe coronavirus-related disease caused by covid-19 like covid-19 severe disease in both sars and mers involved respiratory failure analysis of viral burden in those with the most severe disease showed that their viral titers were declining 12 this is consistent with the concept that an overexuberant immune response contributed to lung damage experiments in animal models showed that highly human-pathogenic coronaviruses such as the agents of sars and mers exhibit rapid viral replication in the lungs that triggers a proinflammatory cytokine response that in turn elicits an inflammatory cell infiltrate that damages the lung 13 hence for sars and mers lung damage that affected pulmonary function and host survival had a strong component of immune-mediated damage although only a few immunocompromised patients have been reported in the sars and mers literature two cases suggest that the disease may have been milder in those with impaired immunity perhaps supporting the idea that lung damage follows a strong immune response a patient with aids was reported to have a mild case of sars a fact attributed to the weakened condition of the immune system of the patient having resulted in a lack of severe disease 14 an early case report describing sars-cov-2 infection in persons with hiv infection did not compare the severity of the disease to that seen in hiv-uninfected persons 15 notably a bone marrow transplant recipient on immunosuppressive therapy suffered only mild sars after infection with sars-cov-1 16 these reports support the idea that exuberant inflammation may be the primary driver of lung damage in patients with covid-19 while this concept requires further investigation as there are currently no data on the course of covid-19 in immunocompromised patients it is consistent with findings in fatal cases during the h1n1 pandemic in which inflammatory damage in the lungs occurred in the absence of significant viral particles 17 on the other hand older age and low lymphocyte counts as well as elevated levels of inflammatory markers were associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with covid-19 in wuhan china 18 although the relationships among immune suppression the inflammatory response and lung damage in covid-19 remain to be unraveled the link between elevated inflammatory markers and respiratory failure has led to the use of immunosuppressive agents ranging from corticosteroids to inhibitors of cytokines such as interleukin-6 il-6 and other inflammatory mediators 19the rapidly evolving clinical picture of covid-19 presents a series of observations that include the followingprevalence and severity of the disease increase with agemany if not most infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild diseaseasymptomatic infected individuals can transmit sars-cov-2 implying viral sheddingindividuals with cardiovascular disease diabetes obesity diabetes and pulmonary disease have higher mortalitycovid-19 disease is less severe and may be asymptomatic in children but a small minority develop a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with similarities to kawasakis diseasesudden deterioration with progressive pulmonary failure can occur in younger individualsthe incidence and severity of disease are higher in men than in womendeath is usually the result of anoxia due to pulmonary failure although there is increasing evidence of dysfunction in other organs including heart kidneys and tissues affected by dysregulated coagulation and thrombosis
the drf framework posits that host damage can occur in the setting of either a weak or a strong immune response an important caveat when considering the strength of the immune response and disease in the context of the drf is that strong immune responses are not necessarily protective if they damage tissue by inducing exuberant inflammatory responses irrespective of whether they clear the microbe thus considering host damage as a function of immune response is a conceptual approach that provides a roadmap for incorporation of viral load and host inflammation into an understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of covid-19the observation that many sars-cov-2 infections are asymptomatic or result in mild disease implies that the immune response in such individuals controls the virus without eliciting damage that translates into clinical manifestations in contrast the manifestations of covid-19 that occur in aged persons andor those with pulmonary cardiac and endocrine conditions are likely to reflect a different immune response that may result in a degree of damage that increases disease severity the immune response of those with comorbidity conditions may be weaker and less effective in clearing virus aging is known to be associated with weaker immunity 6 similarly pulmonary disease cardiac disease and endocrine disease are each associated with organ andor tissue damage that can impair local immune responses and increase the likelihood of viral dissemination and progressive disease men are also known to be more vulnerable to many infectious diseases than women due to stronger immune responses in women 20 hence weaker immune responses might explain the observation that covid-19 is more severe in the aged the chronically ill and menthe relative rarity of symptomatic covid-19 disease in children infected with sars-cov-2 21 is striking a report from china revealed that 79 of children either were asymptomatic or had mild disease 22 and in italy only 12 of children seen in emergency departments with positive tests for sars-cov-2 were ill 23 the mean age of these children was 33 years this is notable since young children are often more susceptible than adults to respiratory viruses that cause pneumonia such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus the increased susceptibility of infants and young children to infectious diseases is often attributed to their having immature immune systems as exemplified by their inability to mount antibody responses to polysaccharides before age 2 however mers was often asymptomatic in children except those who were immunocompromised 24 similarly children were found to be susceptible to but less likely to have severe disease with sars-cov-1 25 thus the immune response of children to these betacoronaviruses may differ from that of adults it has been hypothesized that one factor contributing to the relative paucity of severe disease in children may be a higher percentage of cd4 t cells 26 this is consistent with the idea that the immune systems of children may contain sars-cov-2 more efficiently leading to less damage however a study in wuhan found that infants and younger children were more likely to have severe disease than older children 22 suggesting that age-related differences in the immune response may play an important role in containment of sars-cov-2 it is also possible that children have a different distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor for sars-cov-2 27 another possibility is that childrens immune systems do not react with a degree of intensity that causes tissue damage because they have not experienced multiple infections with other endemic human coronaviruses if this is the case the more severe disease observed in older individuals could reflect exuberant immune responses fueled by immunological memory of prior coronavirus infections however some children infected with sars-cov-2 develop an inflammatory vasculitis known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mis-c with features resembling those associated with kawasakis disease 28 although this syndrome has been described only recently and little is known about its pathogenesis the clinical findings are those of a severe vasculitis triggered by inflammation which again implicates strong immune responses in another facet of covid-19 diseasethe finding that most sars-cov-2 infections are asymptomatic and that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus to others has important implications for the pathogenesis of this disease the issue of asymptomatic transmission of other respiratory microbes remains a subject of intense study 29 30 the presence of high levels of sars-cov-2 in the upper respiratory tract is believed to explain the efficiency of asymptomatic transmission 31 transmission by persons without symptoms means that sars-cov-2 replicates to a level sufficient to be acquired by another person without damaging host tissues sufficiently to trigger clinical signs and symptoms this also implies that for some individuals repeated cycles of viral replication do not translate into damage that results in symptoms notably sars-cov-2 antibody levels were lower in hospitalized patients with less-severe disease suggesting that there is more to learn about relationships among viral load the immune response and disease manifestations 32the main clinical manifestation of severe covid-19 is pulmonary deterioration this often occurs in individuals with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in whom a cytokine storm is believed to drive disease pathogenesis in support of this hypothesis patients with more-severe covid-19 had higher serum levels of il-2r il-6 il-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- than patients with milder disease 33 however they also had lymphopenia suggesting the presence of cytokine storm may reflect a failure of cellular immunity to contain the virus the association of cytokine storm with severe disease and mortality has led to the use of various immunosuppressive agents in patients with elevated inflammatory markers 34 although it is too early to assume that the association of elevated inflammatory markers with severe covid-19 implies causation clinical deterioration in the setting of a strong proinflammatory response is consistent with host damage from an overexuberant immune responsein summary covid-19 is more severe in people who are likely to have impaired immunity such as the aged andor those with comorbidity conditions 35 this supports the concept that in such individuals weak or impaired immune responses may predispose to the development of disease consistent with this hypothesis are data associating lymphopenia and low t cell levels 36 with severe disease and the observation that the prevalence of disease is lower in women who mount stronger immune responses than men in contrast the association of high levels of proinflammatory mediators and cytokine storm with disease severity 37 histologic findings of inflammation an inflammatory prothrombotic state and an absence of viral inclusions in some postmortem reports 3840 suggest that the immune response is itself a major contributor to host damage in covid-19 in this paradigm the asymptomatic to less-severe responses of younger people without comorbidities and of children may reflect a balanced immune response that clears virus without inducing inflammatory damagethe drf provides the ideal paradigm to delve deeper into the pathogenesis of covid-19 by placing its different clinical manifestations on the axes of a parabola to account for their occurrence as a function of host susceptibility and the immune response fig 1 in this schema individuals are categorized into three groups group i consists of individuals with comorbid conditions that may impair the immune response the response of these individuals is located on the left side of the parabola indicating they may develop higher viral burdens and may be at greater risk for progression to severe disease due to an inability to contain the virus in the nasopharynx in some such individuals unchecked viral proliferation may trigger an excessive inflammatory response that further damages the lungs and progresses to pulmonary failure this would indicate a transition to group iii see below in some progressive disease is also characterized by hematological dyscrasia coagulation abnormalities and multiorgan failure which may stem from immune dysregulation in contrast those who do not progress to pulmonary failure may be able to mount an effective response that eventually contains the virus leading to recovery group i also includes immunologically intact individuals who acquired a large inoculum that overwhelmed local defenses resulting in a de facto weak immune response group ii consists of individuals who are infected with sars-cov-2 and remain asymptomatic or manifest only mild disease for such individuals the immune response contains the viral inoculum and subsequent viral replication occurs without leading to a degree of damage that alters homeostasis these individuals have mild or no symptoms of covid-19 although they may transmit virus to others this group also includes children most of whom exhibit mild to no disease manifestations and possibly some pregnant women who may also be asymptomatic 41 group iii consists of individuals from group i whose decompensated disease outcome is the result of an excessive immune response as well as individuals who mount an excessive initial inflammatory response to infection resulting in cytokine storm pulmonary failure progressive organ damage and deaththe mode of infection for sars-cov-2 is generally accepted to be introduction through the respiratory tract diagnosis is made by pcr detection of viral nucleic acids in the upper respiratory airways usually the nasopharynx at this time definitive statements about the relationships between nasopharyngeal virus pneumonia and disease are difficult to make because the pcr test may be associated with false-negative results 42 with this caveat we note that asymptomatic group i individuals may be positive for nasopharyngeal virus 43 44 those in groups ii and iii manifest clinical signs and symptoms of disease that range from cough to respiratory failure at this time the temporal relationship between nasopharyngeal infection and pneumonia is not well understood but it is clear that in some individuals upper airway infection precedes pneumonia while in others there is radiographic evidence of pneumonia with negative nasopharyngeal pcr test results 45 the relationship between nasopharyngeal virus and pneumonia may vary depending on the site of initial infection infection from large droplets that settle in upper airways or fomites could lead to initial nasopharyngeal infection that subsequently spreads to the lungs on the other hand infection from small droplets that reach alveoli would produce lung-first infection that could subsequently reach the upper airways the relationship between the initial infection site in lung or nasopharyngeal sites and outcomes in groups i to iii is unknown as progression to disease would depend on rates of viral replication and the nature of the immune responseanother way to apply the drf to covid-19 is to consider host damage as a function of time using this approach we can organize the outcome of host-virus interaction into discrete states associated with known outcomes of sars-cov-2 infection fig 2 the drf defines four states to describe the outcome of host-microbe interaction commensalism colonization persistence latency chronicity and disease 2 46 the states of colonization and commensalism are the same when the amount of damage from the host-microbe interaction is nil latency is a recognized state that follows infection with some viruses although colonization is not a term commonly used to describe viral infections use of the term in this context helps us to define the outcome of host-virus interaction and to characterize host damage as a function of time for sars-cov-2 we can think of the time that the virus is replicating in the nasopharynx of an infected individual as representing a state of colonization during that period the amount of damage that the host experiences is below the threshold that translates into symptoms thus the person is asymptomatic and yet is able to transmit virus ie is in a contagious state this is the reason that the cdc recommended that all persons wear masks in public 47 namely to lessen the chance that an asymptomatic person would transmit the virus to others colonization can elicit an immune response that leads to sars-cov-2 elimination and resolution of infection or a response that leads to progressive host damage and disease disease leads to death when host damage is irreparable and compromises vital organ function at this time we do not know if there is a chronic persistent state that would correspond to the state of latencyan important tenet of the drf is that strong immune responses do not necessarily represent effective immune responses in fact they can be deleterious to the host by mediating inflammatory damage if they eradicate the microbe or if they fail to do so to make this point for covid-19 we consider parallels between pneumocystis pneumonia pcp in patients with hiv-aids and in patients with comorbidities and covid-19 for both covid-19 and pcp severe disease is accompanied by exuberant pulmonary inflammation that impairs gas exchange and is life-threatening in pcp severely immunocompromised individuals develop a progressive pneumonia associated with hypoxia pulmonary failure and death as alveolar inflammation compromises oxygenation addition of corticosteroid therapy significantly improves survival of hiv-infected persons with hypoxia due to pcp 48 initially the use of corticosteroids in pcp was frowned upon because it involved giving an immunosuppressive drug to patients with profound immunosuppression today the beneficial use of corticosteroids in pcp is a standard of care per the following schema hiv-associated immune impairment  replication of pneumocystis spp in the lungs  increase in levels of fungal antigens  florid immune response  pneumonia  impaired oxygenation we propose that a similar sequence of events may occur in severe covid-19 in those with preexisting cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and the aged except that there is an increased viral burden instead of an increased fungal burden like the intense inflammation seen in cases of hiv-associated pcp the extensive lung inflammation in patients with covid-19 who have conditions associated with impaired immunity may seem paradoxical however it is worth noting that impaired immunity includes dysregulated immune responses that are often characterized by chronic andor inappropriate inflammation hence as noted above individuals in group i include those who mount a weak andor inadequate response to sars-cov-2 infection that leads to immune responses that result in transition to the type of damage seen in individuals in group iii as indicated by the line in fig 1another disease with a clinical course that has some parallels to covid-19 is pneumococcal pneumonia in the preantibiotic era descriptions of this disease noted progressive symptoms with a crisis at 7 to 8 days that was associated with the appearance of serum antibody and agglutinins that was temporally associated with defervescence and recovery 49 50 in contrast an inability to mount an effective antibody response was associated with extrapulmonary dissemination and a systemic inflammatory syndrome that often led to death the clinical course of covid-19 may also have a turning point after an initial phase of fever and cough that is followed by either clinical improvement or deterioration that can progress to pulmonary failure the mediators andor correlates of this turning point in covid-19 are not currently known the turning point of covid-19 has parallels to sars1 as well as to 2009 pandemic h1n1 in those diseases the immune system either eliminated the virus without triggering damage resulting in an asymptomatic state or triggered inflammation and damage resulting in respiratory failuresevere covid-19 and other pulmonary infectious diseases such as pneumocystis infection pneumococcal disease and influenza h1n1 virus and sars1 virus pneumonia are each notable for clinical manifestations that are largely driven by inflammatory damage despite being caused by a fungus bacterium and viruses respectively and for pneumocystis infection pneumococcus disease and influenza the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy these parallels highlight the ability of the drf to deconstruct microbial pathogenesis in a way that illuminates the role of the host in mediating damage that translates into clinical manifestations hence for covid-19 like the other pulmonary diseases the inflammatory response makes a critical contribution to host damage and avoidance or abrogation of this damage should be an important component of therapeutic strategiesconsidering the pathogenesis of covid-19 through the lens of the drf provides a roadmap for therapeutic approaches to this disease the therapeutic goal is to reduce host damage which would reduce the prevalence and severity of disease and translate into reduced mortality currently there are no validated therapies for covid-19 but many are under development and investigation therapeutic approaches can be broadly placed into three groups depending on whether the primary goal is to target the virus or the host immune response or both with the important caveat that antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are interdependent such that a strategy that targets one is likely to also affect the otheri antiviral the ability of small molecules that interfere with hiv herpesvirus and hepatitis virus replication to treat diseases caused by these viruses established the principle that drugs that target the virus can be effective in viral diseases today numerous compounds are under investigation that target viral replication and there is confidence that effective antiviral compounds against sars-cov-2 will be developed from the viewpoint of the drf these drugs function by reducing viral burden which can reduce virus-mediated tissue damage and avert or reduce the development of organ-damaging inflammatory responses one such drug is remdesivir an antiviral agent that received emergency authorization for use in covid-19 51 although the effect of remdesivir on sars-cov-2 viral load in patients has not been published it ameliorated disease in mers coronavirus-infected macaques by inhibiting viral replication 52 and was recently shown to reduce lung viral loads in macaques 66ii immunomodulator this class of agents modifies the course of disease by affecting the immune response and moving the individuals immune response to either the right or the left along the x axis of the drf parabola fig 3 given what we know about the pathogenesis of covid-19 immune modulators that enhance the immune response would be contraindicated although one can imagine potential usefulness in individuals at the extreme left of the parabola if they are unable to mount an effective antiviral response in this regard we note that although interferons are critical for an effective immune response against coronaviruses their therapeutic role in experimental and clinical disease is uncertain and could be detrimental 53 possibly because we currently cannot identify the group of patients on the left of the parabola who would benefit from this intervention on the other hand there are ongoing clinical trials with anti-inflammatory drugs targeted to various inflammatory mediators such as il-6 including tocilizumab and high-dose intravenous gamma globulin 54 the idea behind the use of these agents is to inhibit the development of damage mediated by the host inflammatory response targeting inflammation proved successful for pneumocystis pneumonia some studies support the use of corticosteroids in bacterial pneumonia and there is anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of immune modulators such as statins in viral pneumonias 55 56 steroids are used widely for covid-19 and a press release from a large randomized clinical trial recovery reported that they reduced mortality in patients requiring oxygen supplementation httpswwwrecoverytrialnetfilesrecoverydexamethasonestatement160620v2finalpdf from the viewpoint of the drf immune modulating agents such as corticosteroids reduce inflammatory damage and shift the curve to the left fig 3 although immune modulating agents do not target the virus directly the hope is that by reducing host damage the host will gain time to mount effective antiviral responses that lead to viral elimination and recovery however given the cascade of inflammation that may extend to complement and noncytokinenonchemokine mediators the use of two or more types of immune modulator might be necessary to harness and extinguish sars-cov-2-mediated immune dysregulation the concern about the use of steroids and other agents that suppress the immune response in covid-19 is that they may inhibit antiviral activity andor increase the likelihood of superinfection with bacteria and fungi clinicians must be vigilant and aware of the latter the ability to identify those patients who would most benefit from moving to the left on the drf parabola would help clinicians administer such agents with more confidenceiii specific immunoglobulins the only compounds that reliably target both the virus and the immune response are specific immunoglobulins as they have both virus-specific neutralizing and protean effects on the immune response ranging from activation of fc receptors and complement to enabling antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity there is an extensive body of evidence supporting the efficacy of convalescent plasma to treat viral pneumonias that dates back to the 1918 epidemic although most reports case series and uncontrolled studies have been favorable 5759 the approach has not been tested in large randomized controlled trials we have proposed that this approach be considered and tested 60 61 and there is some evidence for its usefulness against covid-19 6265analysis of covid-19 patients in the context of the drf suggests that the optimal therapeutic approach should depend on where their immune response lies on the parabola although all patients with covid-19 may benefit from antiviral agents that target sars-cov-2 optimal therapy is likely to also require agents that reduce host damage by modulating the immune response and moving the patients position to the left along the x axis treatment with immune modulating drugs may be important for those individuals with either insufficient or overexuberant immune responses that result in severe damage and disease the drf suggests a way to identify patients for clinical trials of investigational therapies particularly for agents that affect the immune response clearly individuals with covid-19 in groups i and iii are likely to respond differently to immune modulating drugs even when presenting with similar clinical conditions 7 as we gain a greater understanding of the way in which the clinical manifestations of covid-19 reflect viral factors and the host immune response it will be possible to develop algorithms that place affected individuals on the parabola to guide and optimize approaches to therapythe drf makes it possible to assemble the diverse manifestations of covid-19 into one synthesis that explains the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of this disease as a function of the host immune response the drf also provides a schema to design therapy based on anticipated effects on disease pathogenesis and host response and how they affect the position of the patient on the x axis of the drf parabola the drf is flexible and will be able to accommodate new information as we learn more about covid-19 for example between the date when this paper was first submitted for publication and its revision mis-c which the drf places on the right side of the parabola and the promise of corticosteroids in patients requiring supplemental oxygen were described most importantly placing covid-19 in the context of the drf can stimulate new thought concerning the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 as a function of the host immune response this provides a dynamic approach to research and therapy of this complex disease based on consideration of how to move patients immune responses from a state of disease to one of healthin december 2019 there were the earliest reported clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin epidemiologically linked to exposure at a seafood and wet animal market in wuhan hubei province china 1 the cause of this pneumonia was rapidly identified as a new -coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 in january 2020 the world health organization who officially coined the term coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which rapidly became a pandemic worldwide as of june 9th 2020 over 71 million cases of covid-19 have been confirmed globally coronavirusjhuedumaphtml with a 37 mortality rate that largely occurs in the 20 of the cases that develop severe disease defined as patients with bilateral interstitial pneumonia and in adulthood 2 in these cases respiratory failure resembling acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is considered the leading cause of mortality 3from a pathogenesis standpoint viral infections generally trigger a vigorous immune response that is crucial for viral clearance with a cascade of events involving both the innate and adaptive immune arms in most of the cases as covid-19 is a new emerging disease little is known about the immunological changes that occur in the infected human host but several reports have been published describing the immunological alterations in patients with this condition these range from a maladaptive immune response and abnormal cytokinechemokine production to hyperactivation of t cells and increased number of activated monocytes macrophages and neutrophils which may ultimately be associated with covid-19 outcome 4 5 6 7 8it seems that covid-19 shares a similar inflammatory immune response with autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions viruses not only share immune responses with autoimmune diseases ads but they can break immunological tolerance by a variety of mechanisms that include molecular mimicry bystander activation and epitope spreading 9 10 11 some examples of viruses linked to autoimmunity and autoinflammation include enteric viruses for type i diabetes 12 hepatitis c virus for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and sjgrens-like syndrome 1314 influenza viruses for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 15 and herpesviruses for systemic lupus erythematosus sle rheumatoid arthritis ra and adult-onset stills disease aosd 16 17 18 nowadays it has been already linked sars-cov-2 with guillain-barr syndrome gbs 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 autoimmune hemolytic anemia immune thrombocytopenic purpura 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 and kawasaki disease kd 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 in addition the study of critically ill patients with covid-19 has drawn attention to an increased risk of thrombotic events which appeared to be associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies 43 44 45 46 in children the appearance of clinical manifestations resembling kd has drawn attention to a new phenotype of autoimmunity 38 and recent estimates suggest a 30-fold increased incidence of this disease during the pandemic 39 moreover the immunomodulatory therapy widely used for ads its being used for covid-19 47 48 49 herein a scoping review on current advances in the immunopathogenesis of disease as well as the auto-inflammatory and autoimmune conditions observed during sars-cov-2 infection is presentedimmunological diseases are generally classified into three major groups autoinflammatory autoimmune and mixed pattern diseases 50 auto-inflammatory and ads have several features in common since they are both systemic inflammatory diseases involving the muscle-skeletal system and characterized by a hyperactivation of the immune response in genetically predisposed individuals however there are some differences between the two groups in autoinflammatory diseases the innate immune cells directly cause damage whereas in ads the innate immune system activates the adaptive immune responses which are ultimately responsible for tissue inflammation 51from a clinical standpoint ads predominantly affect women and are characterized by the activation of t cells cellular mediated responses or b cells ie presence of autoantibodies or both leading to pathology while the autoinflammatory diseases are invariably seronegative and manifest fever as the most common symptom periodic fever behet disease gout and aosd are paradigmatic for autoinflammatory diseases while sle ra and ss are major examples of ads a third intermediate group named mixed pattern diseases comprises several conditions which do not completely fit with either classification this is the case for example of spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases such as crohns disease 52 increasing knowledge of these diseases has revealed that the two major groups are in fact interconnected with the mixed pattern diseases representing a bridge between them as a continuum model from autoinflammation to autoimmunity 53 indeed it is well known that the innate and adaptive immune system are strongly interconnected and crucial points of connection are represented by toll-like receptors tlr il-1 and inflammasome activation 54 55 56a paradigmatic example in this sense is given by the activation of severe psoriasis flares after upper respiratory tract infections patients affected by chronic plaque psoriasis a bona fide ad may develop acute flares clinically resembling the generalized pustular psoriasis a clinical entity with molecular features of autoinflammatory syndromes ie deficiency of il-36 receptor antagonist 57 interestingly in these patients rhinoviruses and coronaviruses have been the infectious agents most frequently identified as triggering factors for both autoimmune- plaque psoriasis and autoinflammation- pustular psoriasis linked forms of the psoriatic disease 57 the pathogenetic differences between auto-inflammation and autoimmunity are mirrored by the different therapeutic approaches particularly approaches that involve the use of biologic agentsenvironmental epigenetic and genetic factors influence autoinflammatory and ads the inner characteristics of a population may influence the development of such conditions when they are exposed to an infection this explains why despite the association of certain pathogens with a specific disease there is still a considerable group of healthy individuals who after exposure to a microorganism does not develop the disease 58both hla and non-hla polymorphisms are associated with inflammatory and ads polymorphisms in hla class i and hla class ii molecules affect which amino acids are in the peptide-binding groove and thus their binding specificity in general foreign antigens presented by class i molecules are derived from intracellular infections caused by viruses or from proteins synthesized in the cytosol 58 a small study in a han population suggested that hla-c0729 and b1527 alleles may be associated with covid19 59 the first genome-wide association study in a european population published as a preliminary report showed that carriers of abo a-positive group were at a 45 increased for respiratory failure while individuals with blood group o were at a 35 decreased risk for respiratory failure 60 in addition a cluster of genes that could be relevant to the development of severe covid-19 was identified on chromosome 3p21 one of these genes slc6a20 encodes a transporter protein that interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the sars-cov-2 receptor required for cell entry 60host-pathogen interactions are vital to the understanding of infectious disease as well as its treatment and prevention in this sense considering the genetic variation at the genome of sars-cov-2 wwwgisaidorg will contribute to the knowledge of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis 61lineage b coronaviruses which include sars-cov and sars-cov-2 interact with the host receptor ace2 for viral entry the interaction is mediated by the receptor binding domain rbd region within the spike protein s of the virus the latter common to all beta-coronaviruses the ace2 receptor is expressed in the lungs small intestine testis kidneys heart thyroid adipose tissue brain blood vessels and muscle 62 63 64 65 after viral-receptor fusion in both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections host proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 66 endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin b and l cleave the s protein of the virus leading to the release of the spike-fusion peptide which enables intracellular virus entry zang et al 67 have shown that besides tmprss2 tmprss4 present in gut epithelial cells also contributes to enhance the localized tissue infectivity of sars-cov-2 fig 1
 4 5 6 7 8reduction in percentages of some innate immune cells may play an important role in covid-19 low eosinophil count has been suggested as a poor prognostic marker in covid-19 patients although the precise mechanisms remain unknown du y et al 68 described 85 fatal cases of covid-19 with 81 of the patients having very low eosinophil count at admission additionally other reports showed that low eosinophil count was less frequent in survivors of severe covid-19 and in nonsevere patients 69 than in a small cohort of recovering patients 70 confirming the potential association of low eosinophil count and poor prognosisreduced percentages of circulating natural killer nk cells have also been reported 71 as well as an increased expression of their inhibitory receptor nkg2a that likely contributes to their reduced cytolytic activity 72 moreover bronchoalveolar lavage fluid transcriptome from covid-19 patients revealed an increase in dendritic cells dcs and activated neutrophils 73 higher percentages of inflammatory monocytes have been recorded in patients with severe lung pathology 74several studies have shown a torrent of pro-inflammatory cytokines table 1
 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 it is quite possible that much like sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov sars-cov-2 could induce a delayed type i ifn response with a loss of viral control during the early stage of infection 86 blanco-melo et al 76 showed in animal models and select patients with covid-19 that reduced type i and iii ifn are associated with subsequent failure in the control of virus replication this phenomenon was observed at initial stages ie the first 7 days post-infection with a paradoxical increased production of chemokines such as cxcl17 cxcl16 cxcl9 cxcl8 these chemokines may enhance migration of additional innate cells such as monocytes macrophages and neutrophils decreased production of type i and iii ifn is maintained during the late stages of disease 14 days post infection accompanied by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 il-8 and tnf-other cells involved in covid-19 disease are the pulmonary endothelial cells ecs these cells may be associated with the development of pulmonary complications such as ards due to the modification of vessel barrier integrity promotion of the pro-coagulative state and dysregulation of inflammatory cells infiltration secondary to vascular inflammation ie endothelialitis ecs have an important role in ards and multi-organ failure therefore therapeutic strategies related to these cells should be studied 87 in fact van de veerdonk et al 88 have proposed that pulmonary edema in covid-19 is caused by activation of bradykinin 1-2 receptors on ecs therefore inhibiting kallikrein activity could prevent ardslymphopenia can be caused by viral infections and is commonly found in autoinflammatory and ads 89 in physiological conditions t cells undergo homeostatic proliferation following episodes of lymphopenia induced by infectious agents to restore their population in the peripheral blood 90 and this proliferative capacity correlates with their avidity for self-antigens several hypothetical mechanisms that could explain lymphopenia in covid-19 patients 1 lymphocytes express ace2 and these die due to viral infection 2 virus directly destroy lymphatic organs that includes destruction of lymphoid cells 3 the generation of cytokine storm that may lead to lymphocyte apoptosis or block of lymphopoiesis 91 4 metabolic alterations induced by the virus infection leads to the generation of molecules that result in lymphoid cell depletion 92 and finally 5 lymphopenia could also reflect differences in lymphocyte homing into tissues out of the peripheral bloodstudies on the changes in lymphocyte subsets demonstrated reduced percentages of cd4 and cd8 t cells as well as b cells in peripheral blood especially in patients with severe disease 71 a lymphopenic state could lead to failure in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance that leads to the activation of effector t cells with autoimmune potential this mechanism of loss of self-tolerance highlights the paradoxical association between lymphopenia and autoimmunity 93 such a scenario is supported by the speculation forwarded previously that a temporary lymphopenia induced by viral infections might trigger autoimmunity 94after infection occurs cd4 t cells are activated in secondary lymphoid organs followed by their migration into the inflamed tissue after pathogen clearance the majority of these cells undergo apoptosis but a small population remains becoming long lived memory cells able to respond more effectively and rapidly during a subsequent infection 95 this phenomenon is known as immunological memory and can be a double-edge sword when these memory cells are formed against self-antigens in fact they are implicated in autoimmune flare ups 96according to preliminary published data covid-19 critical patients express decreased percentages of t helper memory and regulatory t cells in the blood compared to patients with less severe disease 71 these findings raise unsolved questions is the loss of these cell subsets due to their selective trafficking to the lung or is it because they are specifically targeted by the virus more detailed studies about the phenotype of t cells in covid-19 patients showed that both cd4 and cd8 t cells express higher levels of the t cell activation markers eg cd38 or cd44 97 of interest cd44 is an adhesion molecule incriminated in the pathogenesis of a variety of ads and has been proposed as a biomarker of disease and disease activity for sle 98evaluation of patients at the intensive care unit icu disclosed an increase of ox40 expressing cd4 t cells and cd137 expressing cd8 t cells 74 ox40 is known to promote t cell cytokine production 99 while cd137 a member of the tnf receptor family is a potent costimulatory molecule for activated t cells preferentially involving cytotoxic cd8 t cells and cd8 memory cells 100 additional phenotypic studies showed an increased concentration of highly pro-inflammatory ccr6 th17 cells and a reduction in the number of cd28 cytotoxic suppressor t and regulatory t cells 71101 it is possible that a finding of sustained decrease in the cd8 t cell subset lack of viral clearance by secretion of perforin granzymes and ifn- could serve as an independent predictor of covid-19 severity 102 reduction of regulatory t cells and over activation of t cells manifested by increase of th17 and high cytotoxicity of cd8 t cells are described in several autoinflammatoryads and the th17 subset is known to be highly pro-inflammatory and is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoinflammatoryautoimmune conditions the balance between these two cell populations is critical for health 103104two less obvious pathways that are altered in covid-19 include il-7 and p53 first an increased expression of il-7 has been reported in peripheral blood during covid-19 il-7 is a hematopoietic growth factor secreted by stromal cells in the bone marrow and dcs which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of all cells of the lymphoid lineage increased il-7 in severe covid-19 disease may represent an attempt to counteract sars-cov-2-induced lymphopenia second xiong et al 105 found upregulation of pathways associated with apoptosis autophagy and p53 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of covid-19 patients some studies reported that lymphopenia might be related to mortality 106 lymphopenia was also found in mers patients mers-cov can directly infect human t cells and induce their apoptosis without a requirement for virus replication 107 sars-cov-2 can similarly infect t cells but not replicate within them however whether this virus induces t cell apoptosis needs further investigation 108 furthermore in covid-19 a higher expression of pd1tim3 t cells and an increased expression of nkg2a by cd8 t cells have been observed indicating that sars-cov-2 virus induces t cell exhaustion in covid-19 patients 7279concerning b cells a case report from australia first described the kinetics of antibody responses in covid-19 109 immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg antibodies that bound sars-cov-2 virus were detected in blood before symptomatic recovery these immunological changes persisted for at least 7 days following full resolution of symptoms 109 in a small report sera from 5 covid-19 patients were able to neutralize sars-cov-2 in vitro suggesting a possible disease-suppressive humoral response 110 a more recent study investigated the diagnostic potential of serological elisa-based tests in 85 patients with confirmed covid-19 and 24 suspected patients this study showed that igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 can be detected as early as day 4 post infection with readily detectable igg antibodies by day 11 and ongoing post infection these serological tests thus appear to be reasonably sensitive and have a good specificity for covid-19 diagnosis the igg seropositive rate decreased at 28 days after disease onset however the sample numbers tested n  7 were small and the results await confirmation 111long qx et al 7 by using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay reported that seroconversion for igg and igm may occur simultaneously or sequentially in their sample 122 of the patients reached a plateau in igg titer within 7 days of symptom onset 7 more recently xu et al 112 by using the same method confirmed this result which suggest that the value of igm as an early marker for the acute phase of sars-cov-2 infection might not be on par with that in other viral infection diagnostics the lack of similar methods and standardization precludes comparability of resultsfafi-kremer et al 113 carried out a serological study in patients with mild sars-cov-2 infection asserting that 80 of the population present subclinical or mild covid-19 the authors showed that 13 days post-disease onset 99 of the patients had antibodies against sars-cov-2-s protein and 97 of the patients had neutralizing antibodies one month after disease onset interestingly neutralization capacity correlated with antibody levels 114115 although recovered patients from covid-19 without hospitalization and mild disease have low levels of nabs they do have potent antiviral activity and persist up to 40 days after symptoms onset 113116 the identification of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in recovered patients which can bind and neutralize the virus supports the use of convalescent plasma cp as a therapeutic approach of artificial passive immunity 113117 up to now there are several reports that confirm that nabs against rbd can interrupt the interaction between sars-cov-2 and ace2 thus controlling the infection 115118even though anti-viral neutralizing antibodies are important for the viral clearance some authors are questioning if the presence of a premature humoral response against sars-cov-2 might be harmful previous studies in sars-cov animal models showed that antibodies against the spike protein anti-s-igg shares the capability to cause severe lung injury by interfering with the inflammatory response by promoting pro-inflammatory monocytemacrophages accumulation and their release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 119 based on these observations it has been speculated that sars-cov-2 shares a similar inflammatory response with antibody-mediated lung damage through skewing of macrophages or through complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms 120although the safety of cp based therapies is still under investigation recent and strong evidence suggest that this therapy is safe and could offer high rates of efficacy in covid-19 ie reduction of viral load increase in neutralizing antibodies and improvement of clinical status 121 a study of 5000 patients showed that less than 1 of patients presented major adverse events such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload transfusion-related acute lung injury andor severe allergic transfusion reactions 122 in addition the adverse events mechanisms associated with cp infusion suggest that they are similar to intravenous immunoglobulins ivig which include anti-idiotype reactions neutralization of complement and inflammatory cytokines and reduction of migration of t and b cells as well as macrophages 121several studies have now documented the presence of significantly high plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines in patients with covid-19 such chemokines recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to sites of infection and include il-1 ifn ifn-inducible protein ip10 and monocyte chemotactic protein mcp-1 each of which are elevated in covid-19 compared to healthy subjects hs suggesting an activated th1 cell response fig 1 in patients requiring icu admission higher concentrations of g-csf granulocyte colony-stimulation factor ip10 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory proteins mip-1 il-2 il-7 il-10 and tnf have been detected compared to patients not requiring icu admission in the same study il-6 plasma levels were significantly higher in icu patients compared to hs but not compared to non-icu patients 123several cytokines are involved in th17-type responses in covid-19 il-1 and tnf promote th17 responses along with th1 th17-type response contributes to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the context of a css 124css are a group of disorders representing a variety of inflammatory etiologies with the final common result of overwhelming systemic inflammation hemodynamic instability multiple organ dysfunction and potentially death css is not a disease itself but rather the common end point of different initial insults infectious autoimmuneinflammatory and iatrogenic 125 the hemophagocytic syndromes hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh and macrophage activation syndrome mas represent two clinically similar css with an unknown degree of overlap and pathophysiology the clinical presentations of all css can be strikingly similar creating diagnostic uncertainty 125in a report from 150 patients with mild symptoms or severe disease il-6 was found to be significantly higher in the latter group and possibly predictive of mortality 3 in some patients increased levels of il-10 and il-4 have also been reported suggesting that a th2 response is also initiated table 1 126 this line of evidence suggests that the most severe subgroup of patients might experience a css elsewhere defined as a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and certain drugs css is characterized by a variety of symptoms including both mild flu-like symptoms and severe life-threatening manifestations such as ards because of the released of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines fig 2
in the last few years this condition has become of great interest especially among oncologists since it represents an important adverse event following chimeric antigen receptor car-t cell immunotherapy for cancer 127 the understanding of css pathophysiology is largely incomplete but a model has been proposed in which the target cell lysis induces the t cell activation and cytokine release fig 3
 128 while innate immune cells are also activated with further cytokine productionil-6 seems to play a dominant role in css since high levels of il-6 can activate the coagulation pathway and vascular endothelial cells and inhibit myocardial function 129 indeed elevated il-6 levels are observed in patients with css and important beneficial effects of il-6 blockade by tocilizumab an anti-il-6 receptor antibody are achieved in patients with css induced by car-t cell therapy 129 tocilizumab which is widely used to treat ra and giant-cell arteritis was first used in china in 21 covid-19 patients in critical conditions with remarkable improvements 130 since this first report il-6 blockade strategy has been applied to treat other covid-19 patients including italian patients in different areas of the country with promising preliminary resultsa phase ii clinical trial investigating the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in patients with covid-19 pneumonia has been completed and results await data analyses 131 given the condition of hyperinflammation found in these patients selective inhibition of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 signaling by therapeutics such as anakinra or canakinumab has also been suggested 132 giamarellos-bourboulis et al 133 published an interesting study indicating that patients with covid-19 and severe respiratory failure may present with a condition similar to mas driven by il-1 or to an immune dysregulation driven by il-6 these data provide support and the rationale for clinical trials of anakinra or tocilizumab respectively as therapeutic strategies for covid-19 patients experiencing cssin addition the css may trigger the activation of auto-reactive t and b cells in autoimmune susceptible individuals a phenomenon known as bystander activation which occurs when cd8 t cd4 t or b cells are activated in an antigen-independent manner 11 viral infections such as cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus and hepatitis b virus are examples of infectious agents that appear to recognize viral epitopes that mimic self-epitopes and trigger bystander activation via this mechanism 11 although there is no evidence regarding this issue in covid-19 the disproportionate inflammatory response associated with sars-cov-2 may explain the appearance of autoimmune phenomena in the end-stages of the disease including neurological and coagulopathy manifestations fig 2some patients with prior autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions infected with sars-cov-2 have shown better outcomes may be due to baseline immunomodulatory medications some reports have shown that patients with ads with prior treatment with hydroxychloroquine tnf antagonists 134 anakinra 135 or tocilizumab 136 may develop a mildest sars-cov-2 infection these phenomena could be associated with a better control to covid-19 and it may suggest that these medications used chronically decrease the severity of this infection however further analyses are warranted in which other factors associated with covid-19 severity are includedin contrast those patients treated with rituximab 137 or secukinumab appeared to have worst outcome defined by a higher rate of icu admissions 138 those patients treated with rituximab and secukinumab exhibited high concentrations of il-6 suggesting that these medications failed to modulate il-6 which has been strongly associated with mortality in covid-19 138 in addition cd20 blockers could impair b cells function hindering the production of nabs against sars-cov-2 138since patients with ads are prone to infections 58 a major concern is the possibility of a high rate of infection of sars-cov-2 in them emmi et al 139 found an estimated frequency of 022 001121 sars-cov-2 infections in their cohort of italian patients with ads which was comparable to that observed in the general population in another study in patients with autoimmune liver conditions ie autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis authors did not find an increased frequency of cases of sars-cov-2 140these results should be evaluated with caution first health systems worldwide have recommended that those patients with chronic conditions including ads must avoid social contact these recommendations could influence the risk of sars-cov-2 infection and may bias the estimate of its prevalence in ads second as discussed above patients with autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions could exhibit a mild covid-19 this scenario may influence the rate of clinical consultation by these patients since most of infected individuals only visit clinical settings in situations of a severe disease or flares therefore the questions about the risk and prevalence of covid-19 in patients with inflammatory and ads remains openmas is seen most frequently in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in its adult equivalent aosd however it is increasingly reported in other rheumatic disease of childhood including pediatric sle kd juvenile dermatomyositis and antiphospholipid syndrome aps 141 episodes of mas appear to be most commonly triggered by infections particularly viral infections or during periods of high disease activity including the period of disease onset 141the immune response to viruses depends on the sophisticated balance and the coordinated function of several cell types and cytokines encompassing both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system if the immune response is not successful in eliminating the virus it continues to stimulate the inflammatory response with the potential to lead to the development of immunologically-mediated disorders 142 as previously reported patients with covid-19 express higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines considered the major contributors of lung damage moreover this cytokine profile in covid-19 patients is responsible for the hyperinflammatory syndrome with unremitting fever cytopenia hyperferritinemia disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure including ards 143 as mentioned this syndrome is often associated with auto-inflammatory conditions and ads and can be triggered by infections 144 the pathophysiology of mas is still not completely elucidated but a defect in lymphoid cell cytolytic activity has been hypothesized a combination of genetic predisposition and a pro-inflammatory milieu including the presence of il-6 and il-1 may decrease cytolytic functions of nk cells and cd8 t cells with the consequent inability to lyse active antigen presenting cells or infected cells 75 this results in an inflammatory cytokine storm leading to macrophage activation hemophagocytosis and multi-organ failure 145 it is likely that in genetically predisposed individuals sars-cov-2 infection may trigger the occurrence of such a phenomenon as mentioned both a cytokine storm and a reduced cytolytic function of nk cells and cd8 t cells have been reported in covid-19 patients 72with regards to the role of specific cytokines il-1 and il-6 are known to suppress regulatory t cells functions allowing unchecked adaptive autoimmune response 146147 these cytokines are also involved in the pathogenesis of several autoinflammatory and ads such as aosd 148 and ra 149 moreover il-6 induces natural regulatory t cells to acquire characteristics of the th17 cells in a tgf--dependent manner with resultant enhanced pro-inflammatory activity 150 these above-mentioned cytokines represent a th1 response notably pro-inflammatory while cytokines such as il-4 or il-10 represent a th2 response th2 cells initially have been described as anti-inflammatory but a number of reports established a role for th2 cells in tissue inflammation of note several autoimmune conditions are th2-driven eg sle 151 the promising results obtained by il-6r blockers suggest that a th1 response is predominant in the immunopathology of covid-19 130in summary it is tempting to speculate that a pathophysiological model resembling aosd might characterize covid-19 in aosd an environmental trigger possibly an infectious agent leads to the induction of danger signals activating a dysregulated nod-like receptor 3 nlrp3 inflammasome which promotes release of il-1 and il-18 and th1 polarization with subsequent tnf and il-6 production contextually the virus triggers activation of tlr7 and th17 proliferation together with neutrophil recruitment 152 tlr7 is mainly expressed by plasmacytoid dcs pdcs b cells and to a lesser extent by macrophages the tlr-7-myd88 pathway is overexpressed in pdcs of aosd compared to healthy individuals 153 and changes in the nlrp3 inflammasome could be involved in aosd pathophysiology however no polymorphism in the nlrp3 gene have so far been identified thus a reduced threshold of activation or a deregulation of the inflammasome have been hypothesized 154 a similar condition may explain the devastating inflammatory response in the most severe covid-19 patients moreover il-6 stimulates the liver synthesis of ferritin and il-18 triggers nk cell-mediated ifn production which promotes macrophage activation with possible onset of mas fig 3 128155gender differences are recognized in many diseases and are generally manifest by changes in the clinical course symptoms therapy-response and clinical outcome these differences are more striking for ads 156 it is well known that there is a very high gender bias towards females for systemic ads such as sle and ss 91 femalemale ratio while a few other immunological diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis are more prevalent in males 157gender however not only influences the prevalence of these conditions but also the severity of symptoms and the degree of disability indeed some studies describe sle as a more severe disease in men compared to women 158 while women affected by axial spondylarthritis tend to have a greater disease activity and a lower quality of life compared to men 159 the background for these gender-related differences is not completely elucidated but seems to be the result of a complex interaction between sex hormones epi-genetics and the composition of gut microbiota 160 all of which have immunological consequences overall the female immune system has a higher reactivity with enhanced ability to produce antibodies a stronger ability to mount a type i ifn response and also an increased antigen presenting activity by monocytes while men are more susceptible to infections with an increased inflammatory response to infectious pathogens 161 interestingly estrogen was found to exert inhibitory effects on il-6 production 162163 suggesting it can directly hamper the covid-19 related cytokine storm in femalessome of these characteristics may be also responsible for the gender disparities reported for covid-19 severe cases in both china and italy the rate of infection among males and females was similar but the death rate among males was much higher compared to females 164 indeed a study from china reported that while men and women have the same prevalence for sars-cov-2 infection men are more at risk for worse outcomes and death independent of age 165 the precise mechanisms that lead to such disparate outcomes remain to be defined although underlying health status and comorbidities ie cardiac disease obesity among others have been opined as contributory factorsthe risk of reinfection is currently being analyzed in patients with a history of covid-19 in different animal models it has sought to clarify the risk of reinfection of different coronaviruses a ferret model of reinfection was used in acute sars-cov infection the innate immune response was mainly led by the production of ifn the symptomatic ferret previously reinfected or vaccinated had a lacking ifn antiviral response this indicates that a likely modification in the initial response of ifn could influence future reinfections 166 however in a follow-up study in rhesus macaques previously infected with sars-cov-2 no cases of reinfection were documented 167 the presence of viral replication in the nasopharynx and anus was evaluated on different days without finding viral activity on the other hand investigations in african green monkeys described the immune response associated with elimination of sars-cov and the persistence of lung inflammation even after having eliminated the virus 168 in this sense after a period of reinfection the viral clearance was faster however the lung inflammation lasted a few more days so it is not ruled out that the persistence of a long-term protective humoral immune response may be associated with previous disease severityalthough possible cases of reinfection in humans have been suggested the presence of a second sars-cov-2 positive pcr does not necessarily mean viral activity and infectious capacity it should be noted that pcr-based diagnosis does not reveal the presence of live and replicating viruses merely the presence of viral rna therefore a positive pcr test should be evaluated within this context 169 after the sars-cov infection disease a longitudinal study was carried out in 176 patients previously infected in order to evaluate the duration of antibodies the authors showed that the levels of igg antibodies were maintained for 2 years and after 3 years after disease onset these antibodies were drastically reduced 170 despite this it is relevant to consider other factors associated with the durability of protective antibodies against infection including age and the presence of previous infections antibodies to coronaviruses are higher in older compared with younger adults and binding antibodies are more sensitive than neutralizing antibodies in identifying coronavirusassociated illnesses 171the korean centers for disease control and prevention carried out an epidemiological analysis of 285 positive cases and 790 contacts the re-positive cases were renamed as re-detected pcr because neutralizing antibodies and negative viral cultures were documented 172 therefore there is a low risk of reinfection in addition the immune memory response against sars-cov-2 caused by cross-reactivity upon previous exposure to other human-cov virus must be considered 171detection of viral rna after recovery does not necessarily indicate infectivity the infectivity of the virus depends on the presence of the complete virus not only on its rna therefore prolonged positive results may reflect only the lack of complete removal of nucleic acid from tissues 173 bullar et al 174 showed that there was no growth in the samples with cycle threshold value ct  24 or symptom onset to analyze  8 days therefore the ct indicated by the rt-qpcr test should be used as a reliable tool in terms of predicting infectivity and to define the maximum transmission risk period these findings require further tests of cell infectivity in culture to demonstrate that rt-pcr positivity persists significantly beyond infectivitythroughout the sars-cov-2 pandemic autoimmune phenomena mainly hematological ads have been documented table 2

 181 kd may also involve cardiovascular gastrointestinal pulmonary neurological genitourinary and musculoskeletal systems 182 an early innate immune response has been described associated with a high number of neutrophils and release of tnf il-1 and il-6 183 in the first week after the onset of fever the presence of regulatory t cells and pro-inflammatory cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells have been observed 184although the etiology of the disease is not clear the main trigger seems to be infectious 185 there has been a notable increase in the number of kd cases during the pandemic 3839 suggesting an association between sars-cov-2 and this condition to date children continue to be the most affected additionally main cases of incomplete kd have been described together with a high rate of cardiac complications fig 4 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 as reviewed by son 186 this condition is referred to variously as the pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with

reactants was also described in relation to cardiac compromise an elevation of cardiac enzymes was found and in one patient echocardiographic changes as echo-bright coronary arteries on day 1 and then coronary aneurysm at day 7 were described two of the children were positive for sars-cov-2 1 post-mortem and four had an epidemiological link with relatives diagnosed with covid-19belhadjer et al 41 described 35 children with acute heart failure and sars-cov-2 of these several patients showed clinical signs suggestive of atypical kd on the other hand toubiana et al 42 analyzed 21 cases of children with covi-19 associated with kd half of patients exhibited cardiac involvement due to pericardial effusion myocarditis and cardiac arrhythmias which reinforces the high number of patients with cardiac compromisea separate study in italy showed a 30-fold increased incidence of kd children exhibit a higher rate of cardiac involvement and features of mas than those patients with similar manifestations prior to the beginning of this pandemic 39 jones et al 37 described a previously healthy 6-month-old patient in whom the medical examination documented polymorphous rash conjunctivitis and changes in the oral mucosa after two days of fever together with a positive rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 additionally rivera-figueroa et al 40 reported the case of a 5-year-old boy with 8 days of fever presenting with erythematous lips non-exudative conjunctivitis bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy diarrhea abdominal pain and dysuria were observed the increase rate of kd in times of pandemic is striking beside the relationship between sars-cov-2 infection and css mentioned above the mechanisms and risk factors by which kd in children with covid-19 is increasing remains to be elucidatedgbs is an acute inflammatory immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy presenting typically with tingling progressive weakness autonomic dysfunction and pain immune injury specifically takes place at the myelin sheath and related schwann-cell components in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy whereas in acute motor axonal neuropathy the membranes on the nerve axon the axolemma are the primary target for immune-related injury 187the association between sars-cov-2 and autoimmune neurological diseases such as gbs has become relevant table 2 alberti et al 19 reported the case of a 71-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital secondary to paresthesia progressive weakness areflexia and protein elevation in cerebrospinal fluid fulfilling criteria for gbs diagnosis weeks before the diagnosis the patient had experienced fever and during hospitalization the patient presented with dyspnea and severe hypoxia chest tomography showed multiple bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidations all typical of covid-19 pneumonia however confirmation of sars-cov-2 was not donefive additional cases of gbs following sars-cov-2 infection were reported by toscano et al 20 the patients showed neurological symptoms between 5 and 10 days after onset of the viral disease four of them were successfully treated with ivig and one received plasma exchange however a woman with covid-19 developed a severe form of gbs that did not respond to ivig 27 this may suggest that select susceptible patients infected with sars-cov-2 may develop peripheral neurological diseases as reported for other viruses such as zika dengue or cytomegalovirus 187 at present the gbs variant mainly associated with sars-cov-2 is the demyelinating one the case reports presented in table 2 indicate the possible causal relationship between sars-cov-2 infection and gbs through an autoimmune cross-reactivity mechanism however to determine accurately the prevalence of gbs in covid-19 more data and analysis are necessarydinkin et al 28 documented 2 patients with covid-19 and ocular motor palsy miller fisher syndrome and oculomotor nerve inflammation were suspected in one patient while the second patient exhibited a sixth cranial nerve compromise these cases support the association between covid-19 and the appearance of inflammatory neuropathies similar to gbs it has been observed that patients with lymphopenia hyposmia and hypogeusia have a higher risk of developing these neurological manifestations 28 therefore an autoimmune phenomenon triggered by covid-19 should not be ruled out inflammation may compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and this facilitates the affectation of nerve structures 188 on the other hand macrophages expressing ace2 receptors can prolong inflammation in the nervous tissue 189covid-19 is a new disease that rapidly became a dominant global health issue in which scientific interdisciplinary and collaborative work has become more important than ever viruses are known to trigger several autoinflammatory and ads and many immunological abnormalities described so far in covid-19 patients can be observed in auto-inflammatoryautoimmune conditions our current understanding of the covid-19 pathogenic mechanisms is very limited however it is evident that the disease may evolve in four overlapping phases an initial viral phase that may well be asymptomatic or mild in about 80 of patients it is not known why such a large proportion of patients have mild or asymptomatic disease then host-virus interactions take place which dictate the outcome for the subsequent phases of the disease the second phase corresponds to a hyperresponsiveness of the immune system the third phase is characterized by a state of hypercoagulability lastly in the fourth phase an organ damage occurs and its related to the organ- and cell-specific expression of ace2 receptor the intensity of the inflammatory response ie css and the hypercoagulable state given this characterization it is worth asking is covid-19 just an infectious disease or something else 190 or are autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions at the crossroad of covid-19 it also raises the issue of whether other ads may be caused by a coronavirusto date there are no established evidence-based therapies for this new disease however the number of reports showing beneficial effects by immunomodulatory drugs is increasing some of these drugs possess both anti-viral and immunomodulatory effects 191 monoclonal antibodies eg tocilizumab targeting il-6r and anakinra targeting il-1 are currently studied in the treatment of covid-19 similarly colchicine an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders is also under evaluation suggesting that modulation and control of inflammation is crucial and that there is a point during the course of the disease when immunosuppressive therapy maybe a prudent course for the therapy of this new pathological condition 192 clearly we are not fully informed and therapeutic strategies remain in their infancy 193current studies on sars-cov-2 vaccination should consider the topics we have raised here as discussed above bystander activation and molecular mimicry could be associated with the development of autoimmunity while antibody-dependent enhancement may be associated with severity of disease in addition personalized approaches including genotypification of risk genes and evaluation of risk factors for autoimmunity ie familial autoimmunity must be also considered in the current development of vaccines

coronavirus its structural proteins consist of a spike s envelope e nucleocapsid n and membrane protein m among them s glycoprotein on the surface of the virus plays a significant role in adhesion and entry to host cells s proteins bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the host cell surface 1 when the virus enters host cells by endocytosis translation of proteins and replication of rna occurred in the cytoplasm of these cells through the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum system then with an attachment of vesicle containing viral particles to the cell membrane 2 the virus released and activated antigen-presenting cells apc which consequently stimulated humoral and cellular immunity systems as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk pathway and nf-kappa-b signaling pathway which regulated gene expression and altered immune cell differentiation 3 the result is pro-inflammatory cytokines release 4 unfolded protein production and er stress induction 5patients with sars-cov-2 infections which declared as covid-19 will probably develop different stages of the disease from asymptomatic to the mild stage with headache fatigue fever and diarrhea as well as the severe stage with an excessive decrease in lymphocyte count and failure of some vital organs frequently lungs 6 the exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear 7diabetes mellitus dm is defined as abnormal glucose metabolisms and insulin functions it is well recognized as the result of a relative or absolute defect in insulin secretion and variable degrees of systemic insulin resistance the most common form of the dm is type two a heterogeneous complication attributed to insulin resistance with obesity oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation as a background 8 9insulin is an anabolic hormone secreted by beta cells of the pancreas it is responsible for glycemic control by facilitating glucose utilization regulating nutrient hemostasis and stimulating gene expression cell survival and development metabolic actions of insulin have exerted differently in three primary target tissues with additional negative regulation of hormone-sensitive lipase activity insulin leads to a decrease in free fatty acid efflux from adipose tissues 10 11 12 in the lack of insulin sensitivity blood glucose elevated the anabolic action of insulin reduced the end products become glycosylated and oxidative stress increased insulin starts its function by binding to the extracellular alpha-subunit of insulin receptors insr at targeted tissues which induces intracellular beta-subunit autophosphorylationfurther it acted like the trigger of several intracellular signaling cascades through the downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates irs1-4 leading to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pi3k growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 grb2 and mapk signaling pathways 11 12 the pi3k pathway activated several serinethreonine kinases like protein kinase b pkb is also known as akt 13 it largely contributed to insulin metabolic actions including glucose hemostasis lipid and protein synthesis as well as an anti-inflammatory response akt proteins are the major investigated serinethreonine kinases involving in insulin resistance which has realized that akt2 activation is reduced in adipocytes and skeletal muscle in dm type two leading to a higher inflammatory condition mapk pathway another intracellular signal is responsible for gene expression and affects the cell development and inflammatory cascades by intervening in the pi3k-akt pathway in certain conditions mapk can act as a serine protease of irs and interfere with insulin signaling through an inappropriate activation 11insulin resistance and obesity are the major features of dm type two denoted as an insufficient response of targeted tissues to insulin 14 the exact mechanism of insulin resistance is not yet determined but the insidious role of inflammation underlying obesity insulin resistance and dm suggested by several studies 13 understanding the hypoglycemic effect of salicylate an anti-inflammatory agent via the inhibition of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-b kinase ikk is the origin of such studies 13 15 subsequent researches have further highlighted the positive relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance they have also identified obesity as an essential factor in the development of insulin resistance and dm type two 13 the downregulation of insulin receptors has seen in obesity leading to decrease insulin sensitivity 10 irs1 is a common mediator which attributed to insulin signaling dysregulation 12 reduced levels of irs1 are also associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can reduce the irs expression by negative transcription regulating 16 suppressors of cytokine signaling socs are inflammatory proteins overwhelming irs inflammation activates the socs1 and socs3 which induce ubiquitination and finally disintegration of irs proteins 12 17 activation of the insulin receptor stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of irs1 directing the signal transduction while the two major inflammatory pathways inhibit signal propagation by serine kinase activity 12 as previously mentioned the nf-kappa-b pathway plays a crucial role in an inflammatory response silenced by nf-kappa-b inhibitor i-kappa-b in resting cells and can fulminate by serine phosphorylation activity of ikk on i-kappa-b results in i-kappa-b degradation in inflammatory condition 13 15 ikk subset signaling has a close association with obesity and metabolic disorders 15 c-jun nh2-terminal kinase jnk1 is another serine kinase that involves inflammatory signals through the jnkap-1 pathways which also regulates the nf-kappa-b process 12 13in docking analysis of cd26 and covid-19 s glycoprotein conducted by vankadari et al a significant interaction between the proteins was found 18 dpp4 or cd26 is the main receptor for mers-cov which caused the transmission of various species and humans 19in recent years the role of dpp4 in chronic inflammation has been proved dpp4 or cd26 is a glycoprotein on the cell surface with 110-kda molecular weight 20 dpp4 activity has been shown in mice rats and humans and is present in the kidney intestine lungs liver lymph node thymus prostate spleen monocytes epithelial cell and lymphocyte 21 macrophages natural killer nk cells b cells and t cells express the dpp4 protein this protein is multifunctional and involved in cytokine production dna synthesis signaling activation and cell proliferation 20 interferons upregulate the expression of dpp4 il12 and tumor necrosis factor tnf-alpha are involved in the dpp4 translation and translocation cd26 has a role in regulating the migration and maturation of cd4 t-cell antibody production cytokine secretion and immunoglobulin class switching but the exact role of this protein in immune cells is not clear cd26t cells have a strong ability to migrate via endothelial cells 22dpp4 can also interact with caveolin-1 on apc an integral protein on the membrane of smooth muscle cells macrophages and endothelial cells dpp4 and caveolin-1 interaction lead to carma1-lipid rafts carma1 belongs to the maguk family caspase recruitment domain 11-containing membrane-associated kinase whose role is the regulation of nf-kappa-b activation in lymphocytes 20 the dimerization of cd26 is essential for its binding to carma1 the interaction of carma1-dimeric cd26 is via the cytoplasmic tail of the second one this binding of apc to cd26 causes caveolin-1 phosphorylation and interleukin-1 receptor-associated serinethreonine kinase 1 irak-1 and toll-interacting protein tollip dissociation from caveolin-1 22 both irak-1 and tollip are involved in the toll-like receptor tlr signaling pathway 20 afterward the phosphorylation of irak-1 is occurred and activates nf-kappa-b 22 this activation may cause tnf-alpha secretion and consequently jnk activation parallel nf-kappa-b activation induces m1 macrophage and then different interleukins secretion including il1 il6 and il12 fig 1 22 likewise the secretion of tnf-alpha caused by nf-kappa-b during the inflammation activates dpp4 which causes the migration and maturation of cd4 t-cell especially th1 th17 and cytokine secretion dpp4 probably also has a role in the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 alpha 22 which exaggerates the inflammation fig 1so dpp4 has a different role in the immune system such as inflammation-related disease immune responses and t cell activation it also enhances inflammation through the tlr pathway dpp4 inhibitors like sitagliptin affect adipocytes and macrophages as an anti-inflammatory agent 23 the inhibition of dpp4 reduces inflammation intensity in different states 24the severe stage of the covid-19 is associated with lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm which caused multi-organ damage 7 therefore identification of the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines that incorporate in the cytokine storm can be an important step in the therapeutic approach some studies identified that diabetic patients are at a higher risk for covid-19 infections 25 due to that dpp4 expressed on the different cell surfaces dpp4 inhibitors in addition to the anti-diabetic effect can inhibit t cell proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce the severity of inflammation sitagliptin is a dpp4 inhibitor that can reduce inflammatory response 26 interestingly the docking studies have also suggested an additional association of dpp4 with s glycoproteins of the new coronavirus 18 in addition to the fact that the inflammatory mediators are active in individuals with covid-19 and blocking the predominant pathway could be beneficial the present hypothesis suggests a new therapeutic approach by linking the covid-19 pathogenesis with diabetes and potential sitagliptin mechanisms at the molecular levelsapcs like dendritic cells present viral antigens to t cells and play a significant role in the immunity system that leads to the production of cytokines and activation of cd8 t cells the innate immune system includes macrophage dendritic cells neutrophils and t cells that express pattern recognition receptors prrs like tlr for detecting viral and microbial compartments 4 19 dysregulation of the immune system like inflammatory cytokine storm and lymphopenia has been confirmed in the severity of coronaviruses 27 however inflammation is a proper biological response to pathogens and the inflammatory responses can also act as a double aged sword in infection conditions 28 in covid-19 infection changes in the immune system can cause deregulation in the immune system and higher expression of inflammatory pathways especially nf-kappa-b that induces the further production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the different mechanisms leading to the cytokine storms increased pro-inflammatory cytokines level in the lungs prevents proper function of lungs and possibly causes lung failure 19 29 the stimulus of inflammation initiated by receptors activation and then developed within the intracellular signaling like the nf-kappa-b pathway i-kappa-b protein is an inhibitor of nf-kappa-b activation presenting in the cytoplasm under the physiological state whereas in the inflammatory condition prrs activates ikk an inhibitor kinas of i-kappa-b leads to the i-kappa-b degradation and eventually causes the translocation of nf-kappa-b to the nucleus to induce transcription of inflammatory genes 30 activation of nf-kappa-b signaling is responsible for the induction of the nave t cell activation and proliferation which leads to the induction of chemokine expression and additionally the inflammatory effect of different innate immune cells and tcr t cell receptor signaling 31 the pro-inflammatory effect of nf-kappa-b on macrophage was extremely studied activated macrophages have different phenotypes including m2 activated alternatively and m1 macrophage m2 phenotype can produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like il10 and il13 but the m1 form produces inflammatory cytokines like il1 il1beta il 6 il12 tnf-alpha and il8 and involve in different inflammatory conditions 32 il6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that triggers the nf-kappa-b pathway and allows it to translocate transcript and finally release inflammatory mediators 20 the nf-kappa-b pathway is an essential transcription factor for the induction of the m1 phenotype of macrophage and essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes that encode il1beta il6 tnf-alpha cyclooxygenase two and il12 33 nf-kappa-b induces differentiation of inflammatory t cells to consist of th1 and th17 that mediate inflammatory response and involved in different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions th1 secretes interferon-gamma ifn-gamma which contributes to inflammatory processes nf-kappa-b promotes secretion of cytokines by affecting the tcr signaling which increases the differentiation of th1 cells 34 th17 secrete il17 which recruits neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inflammation the aberrant activation of the nf-kappa-b pathway stimulates tlr to produce il6 which induce th17 differentiation and increase the production of ifn-gamma and il1beta with t cells 31 34 as mentioned above tlrs are the members of the prps group that involved in the activation of inflammatory processes tlrs signaling activates the intracellular signaling processes and leads to the nf-kappa-b translocation to the nucleus 35 patients with covid-19 have multi-organ damages like liver heart and kidney disorders and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in a severe stage that cause acute lung disorders pulmonary edema and consecutively failure of lungs a life-threatening condition these events are involved with cytokine storms cytokine storms increased expressions of cytokines like il2 il6 il8 il9 il17 il1beta granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor gm-csf granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf il10 macrophage inflammatory protein 1a mip1a mip1b and tnf-alpha in the serum of patients at the later stage of the disease icu patients had a large account of il2 il10 il7 tnf-alpha mipa and monocyte chemo attract protein-1 mcp1 compared to non-icu patients 27 it has been clear that sever cases of covid-19 patients with higher neutrophillymphocyte had a higher level of inflammatory cytokines like il6 il1 but a lower account of cd4t cells level compared to covid-19 patients with a lower ratio of neutrophillymphocyte 36 in the peripheral blood of covid-19-patients the number of lymphocytes decreased but they are in the excessive activated status in this condition activated cd8 t cells have a higher expression level of cd44 cd69 and cd38 but activated cd4 t cells have a higher level than healthy control individuals 3 37as a presence of low-grade chronic inflammation in diabetes the nf-kappa-b pathway is almost always excited elevated nf-kappa-b pathway expression in diabetes affects the immune system in such patients diabetic patients could also suffer from high levels of th1 and th17 which can explode the inflammatory cascade in an uncontrolled manner 3 activation of the innate immune system in adipose tissue has been suggested in connection with inflammation obesity and diabetes 38 weight gain causes adipose tissue remodeling and expansion with inadequate supporting of vasculature leading to higher oxygen supply and consequently trigger cellular hif-1 to promote inflammation state 12 as a part of inflammation state adipokines may alter where mcp1 mip il8 il6 il1beta and tnf-alpha are increased as well as adiponectin and il10 are less secreted 38 39 these higher factors will activate adipose tissue macrophages and t cells leading to the release of more pro-inflammatory chemokine to attract other immune cells 40 41 various evidence has indicated that adipose tissue macrophages play a major role and confront inflammation in the metabolic organs it is also determined that predominantly anti-inflammatory m2-type macrophages are transformed into pro-inflammatory m1-macrophages in the obese population 13 42 ikk plays a vital role in both obesity and metabolic disorders and is also involved in interferon signaling which is essential for fighting with viral infections 15 enhanced production of ifn-gamma in adipose and hepatic tissue may also cause insulin resistance contributing to the switch from m2 macrophages to the m1 phenotype 42 free fatty acids are also able to promote nf-kappa-b by tlr24 activation leading m1-subset to overcome 12 15 one of the most co-existing complications of diabetes is obesity-induced insulin resistance it has a major role in ongoing inflammation via the macrophage switching to m1 type the release of various cytokine especially il6 and tnf-alpha increase th1 and th17 cells stimulation of tlr24 and finally activation of ikk fig 1 macrophages can also exert their inflammatory responses via jnk-1 signaling an important component of obesity-induced insulin resistance 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha and il6 disturb the insulin action which consequently leads to systemic and local insulin resistance 43 tnf-alpha impairs insulin function by irs1 tyrosine phosphorylation blockade in adipose and muscle tissue 44generally it has been reported that patients with dm are more susceptible to viral infections and covid-19 is no exception 45 there are various reasons why diabetic patients are more likely to develop covid-19 symptoms and progress to more complications patients with dm have shown to have increased receptor expression more virus entry impaired immunity response decreased phagocytic activity reduced viral elimination dysregulated inflammatory cytokines and higher susceptibility to hyperinflammatory states accordingly a closer look at each of these mechanisms could reveal a way to treat covid-19 not only in the diabetic population but for all patients diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection and complications and new clinical challenges exhibited in controlling of the covid-19 in diabetes 46 47 epidemiological documentations have declared severe clinical manifestation and more complications in patients with covid-19 and co-morbid diabetes 25 the chronic state of low-grade inflammation and increased formation of glycosylated end products and oxidative reactive stress may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of individuals with diabetes one of the suggesting sites of intervention between diabetes and covid-19 is ikk with a particular relative role on nf-kappa-b signaling as well as simultaneously association with insulin resistance and viral infection combat chronic expression of ikk in diabetes shows the double burden of diabetes and viral infections 15 although there is a basal inflammatory activity among the diabetic hosts the strong clinical evidence has supported delayed and dysregulated inflammatory signals followed by impaired immune responses aligned with inflammation ace2 expression and furin level the two important binding mediators who mediate the virus entry and initiate viral pathogenesis have been augmented in diabetic hosts 46 47 the altered glucose metabolism and oxidative stress have directly impaired phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages 48 together with defective apc recruitment and function the initiation of adaptive immunity delayed in diabetic populations a unique cytokine profile in the diabetic state also modifies the acquired immunity through both arms in t-cell subset cd4 th1 th17 and cd8 cytotoxic t cells ctl are up-regulated whereas cd4 th2 and regulatory t treg cells are diminished 48 49 treg cells have an important role in immunological tolerance the cd4 involved in the auto-reactive t cells suppression and in vivo studies showed that they prevented the progression of diabetes 50 diabetes also delays the b-cells activation which may have considerable regulatory effects on the other functional immune response 48the bold role of dpp4 in different disorders like inflammation cancer immune disease and diabetes put dpp4 inhibitors in the spotlight 22 on the other hand the parallel analysis of covid-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches sitagliptin is a dpp4-inhibitor a class of oral diabetic agents for treating diabetes mellitus type two 51 they are in the market since 2006 patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease who consumed sitagliptin had a better inflammatory state 21 dpp4 inhibitors may have the anti-inflammatory effect independent of their effect on glp-1 level dpp4 inhibitors are supposed to decrease the expression of cd26 on the immune cell surface which led to the inhibition of innate immune system activity some data suggest that the positive role of dpp4 inhibitors like sitagliptin in controlling the inflammation is due to the increase of glp-1on the other hand some studies believe that dpp4 inhibitors adjust the activity of the innate immune system and t-cell activation and act as an anti-inflammatory agent 20 alogliptin a dpp4 inhibitor inhibited the inflammation mediated by macrophage due to the presence of lps in u937 cells in nga et al study 52 sitagliptin reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on nf-kappa-b signaling pathway 53 it also decreases apoptosis wholly partially suppresses il1beta and il6 levels 20 and inhibits tnf-alpha secretion dose-dependently in vitro 21 makdissi et al proved the anti-inflammatory effect of sitagliptin in humans for the first time sitagliptin suppressed the nf-kappa-b and the expression of cd26 and tlr-2 at time 2 hours the nf-kappa-b suppression may decrease m1 macrophages activity nave t cells and innate immune cells that finally lead to the reduction of the inflammatory condition and prevent the progression of the diseases and the occurrence of cytokine storm inflammation the suppression of cd26 maintained at week 12 as well as the expression of tnf-alpha jnk-1 and tlr4 a receptor for lipopolysaccharide was suppressed at week 12 suppressing tlr2 and tlr4 leads to nf-kappa-b suppression besides the plasma concentration of il6 and c-reactive protein decreased in week four and two respectively 24covid-19 is becoming a global health threat due to being highly contagious and is leading to mortality rates covid-19 patients who reached the late sever stages developed the remarkable lymphocytopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm which caused multi-organ damage pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection shows an immune system dysregulation with the major role of a well-known inflammatory pathway nf-kappa-b the nf-kappa-b involves the defective cycle which induces inappropriate cd4t cell differentiation and more inflammatory signals that causes the systemic inflammatory condition and various organs to be involved with pro-inflammatory cytokines and consecutively lead to cytokine storm on the other hand diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance it has been revealed that the inflammatory process has an ambiguous role in diabetes onset and development it is considering the fact that diabetic patients are more likely to contract covid-19 infection signaling analysis of diabetes-inflammation linkage indicates the persistent nf-kappa-b activity and low grade chronic inflammatory state among the diabetic populationas the control of the inflammation is an important step in both covid-19 and diabetes mellitus treatment modulating the macrophage transformation and t cell differentiation via the suppression of dpp4 tnf-alpha and tlr24 are parallel approaches which are added to the direct nf-kappa-b suppression due to the different role of dpp4 in the immune system such as inflammation-related disease immune responses and t cell activation especially th1 and th17 which have an inflammatory effect dpp4 inhibitors are considered useful as discussed this drug class can meet all of the above anti-inflammatory goals owning to their effects on the immune system the drug inhibitory effect on various interleukins and cytokines such as il6 il1beta and tnf-alpha has been approved in different in vitroin vivo studies the recent evidence of sars-cov-2 docking analysis which has interestingly shown the interaction of s glycoprotein and dpp4 receptors magnifies the dpp4 inhibitors role more than before sitagliptin decreases the inflammation via suppressing main inducers and different characters in the nf-kappa-b signaling pathway hence dpp4 inhibitors like sitagliptin should be a good candidate for controlling the inflammationthe authors declare no conflicts of interestin december 2019 the emergency of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan china posed a serious and urgent threat to the medical and health public in the world 1 on 11 february 2020 the world health organization who officially named 2019ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease caused by it as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on 30 january 2020 the who declared covid-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern then on march 11 who made an assessment that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic it is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus emerged rapidly since sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 20122 which made public health care institutions around the world face greater challengessars-cov-2 showed a similar pattern of infection clinical features and even faster transmission rate 3 than the two coronaviruses have already erupted 4 however it is of particular attention that acute lung injury ali systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards occur in sars-cov or mers-cov infected patients as well as in severe patients with covid-195 cytokines have been found that play a key role in driving the appearance of these clinical features and are also at the core of inflammation development 6 7 consistent with the previous findings severe covid-19 patients showed significantly increased in cytokines such as il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf with the characteristics of a cytokine storm 8 when sars-cov-2 infects the body the inflammatory response plays an antiviral role but the strong cytokine storm due to the unbalanced response will make a huge damage on patients therefore taking some strategies to suppress effectively the cytokine storm is an essential way to prevent the deterioration of patients with covid-19 and save the patients lives which is of great significance for the treatment of critically ill patients and reducing the mortality rate in this review sars-cov-2 and the occurrence mechanisms of cytokine storm induced by it will be introduced in detail including the ways in which cytokines are activated and released how they cause cell and organ damage and therapeutic interventions to prevent or quell this harmful processsars-cov-2 is a zoonotic human coronavirus cov closely related to those coronaviruses that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov discovered 9 coronaviruses are a group of positive-sense single-strand rna viruses with the largest genetic material and a likely ancient origin because the envelop spinous process similar to the corona known as coronavirus 10 sars-cov-2 belongs to the -coronavirus genus all coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes two thirds genomes consist of two large overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b which are translated into 16 non-structural proteins nsp1 to nsp16 the remaining genome encodes structural proteins including nucleoprotein n receptor binding site spike glycoprotein s small envelope glycoprotein e and membrane glycoproteins m11 coronavirus entering targeted cells is mediated by spike protein the s protein includes two domains the s1 subunit is responsible for binding to the receptor and the s2 subunit combinate the virus and the host cell membrane 12 among the coronaviruses that have been identified n protein is the only protein present in the nucleocapsid and participates in viral replication binds to rna which is composed of two separate domains the n-terminal domain s1-ntd and the c-terminal domain s1-ctd both serve as rna receptor binding domains rbd13 coronaviruses have been recognized as the causes of mild and severe respiratory tracts diseases in humans and some animals compared with the other four low-pathogenic human viruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hku1 are prone to cause mild cold-like symptoms the two highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov cause severe respiratory infected in humans and even progress to fatal multiple organ failure14 in the light of published genomic data the sequence homology between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov was 79615 most of proteins are also highly homologous16 besides there are still unknown about the origin of sars-cov-2 although those cases were originally thought associated with huanan seafood market wuhan8 so these basic but important researches are exigent for rapidly finding the source for sars-cov-2 in order to prevent the ongoing outbreakit has been reported that the early clinical manifestations of patients with covid-19 are mainly fever 98 the second most common symptom was cough 82 shortness of breath which rapidly progress to pneumonia 8 nausea or vomiting and diarrhea were uncommon 17 abnormalities were found in chest computed tomography ct images of the patients mainly grinding glass-like opacity areas in bilateral lungs of the infected 72 18 common underlying diseases in patients may be risk factors for poor prognosis including diabetes hypertension chronic heart disease and kidney disease especially for older men 19 with a median time from the first symptoms to dyspnea of 50 days developing to ards time is 80 days 20 a study showed that 17 of patients progress to ards 11 of whom condition worsened within a short period time and died of multiple organ failure 21 patients with covid-19 have very similar clinical characteristics to those infected with sars-cov or mers-cov 6 22 23 positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test can diagnose covid-19 assisted with ct and antibody tests the most common abnormalities in laboratory results include normal or reduced white blood cells lymphocyte decreased 83217 and abnormally elevated alt and ast24 25 proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and tnf- increased d-dimer c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin pct also increased8 in addition patients plasma angiotensin ii ang ii levels were significantly increased which was related to viral load and lung injury 24clinical manifestations and pathology studies have shown that patients with covid-19 mainly performed lung injury 26 and most of the deaths due to multiple organ failure caused by ards 5 27 in addition icu patients showed higher levels of plasma cytokines like il-628 d-dimer crp and pct29 suggesting that inflammatory responses played a key role in these injuries and may also be related to the severity of the patients30 even the cause of death owing to the lack of direct evidence it is unclear how the process of inflammatory response involved cytokines is fully completed but it is certain that the manifested clinical features are directly related to the violent occurrence of inflammationcytokine storm refers to the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that having a wide range of biological activity from a variety of tissues cells mainly for immune cells which due to different infection and a loss of negative feedback on the immune in turn those cytokines drive a positive feedback on others immune cells and continue to recruit them to the sites of inflammation begetting the growing inflammation exponentially and organ damage in short it is the unceasing extreme activation and attack of the autoimmune system the main cytokines involved are interleukin il interferon ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf colony stimulating factor csf chemokine family growth factor gf etc they are divided into pro-inflammatory factors such as il1 il6 il12 tnf ifn and anti-inflammatory factors such as il4 il10 il13 tgf based on their functions cytokine storms are a crucial cause of ards systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure 31 moreover the viruses invade lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to produce progeny nucleic acid which stimulate infected cells to release cytokines and chemokines activating macrophages and dendritic cells etc 13 much more chemokines and cytokines are released from these cells to attract more inflammatory cells to migrate to the site of inflammation from the blood vessels thereby cascading amplification the inflammatory responseit has long been believed that well-coordinated and rapid innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection the cytokines synthesized and secreted by immune cells are involved in the induction period and effect phases in all inflammatory reactions more importantly activating the initiation of cytokine transcription mechanism to promote secretion is the key link when immune cells in the body detect the pathogen-associated molecular pattern pamp from the virus through the pattern recognition receptor prr on the cell membrane immediately the innate immune response system is activated 32 among the prrs the most typical is toll-like receptor tlr3 tlr3 is a transmembrane receptor extracellular accessory proteins md-1 md-2 and rp105 are involved in the recognition of pamp 33 macrophages are the key cells for host defense tlr3 on macrophages specifically recognizes the intermediate product ds-rna of virus replication followed by the recruitment recruits signal transfer proteins myd88 tirap tram or trif in the cytoplasmic tir domain activation of various kinases iraks tbk1 and ikks and tumor necrosis factor receptor-related factor 6 traf6 according to the different adaptors eventually nf-b mapk or jnk-stat pathways were activated to promote the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and produce ifn il-1 and il-6 etc coordinating local or systemic inflammatory responses34figure 1
 il-1 and il-6 are the major pro-inflammatory cytokines released during viral infections 35 il-1 enhances inflammatory responses of bronchia and alveolar in patients with lung injury at the same time acute phase proteins from hepatocytes stimulated by il-1 and il-6 activate the complement system and the complement cascade further increases vascular permeabilityprr activates multiple cytokine transcription and delayed ifn- and - responseil-6 has always been an important star factor in cytokine storms in virus-infected lesions il-6 can respond to il-1 tnf- or tlr signals trigger cis-regulatory modules and activate the nf-b transcriptional signaling pathway and the binding site of the nuclear factor il-6 caatebp 36 but the most important is that il-6 combines with transmembrane receptor il-6r to generate the il-6il-6r complex then the signal transduction component gp130 dimerization induced by the complex and activated janus kinase signal transduction and transcription activators 37 figure 1 high levels of il-6 can activate the coagulation system and increase vascular permeability providing conditions for the rapid spread of inflammation 37 as reported that higher levels of il-6 in severe patients with covid-19 which proves that high levels of il-6 may cause greater damage to lung tissue 8 it has been verified in vitro that sars-cov s protein induces upregulation of il-6 and tnf- in mouse macrophages through the nf-b pathway 38 the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response pathway is a series of intersecting networks each one has a degree of redundancy and with alternate pathways the combinations of tlr and ligands initiate signal cascaded amplification and lead to the activation of multiple cytokine pathways which is the main research focus of current inflammatory responsesthrough the regulation of cytokines and chemokines conventional lymphocytes t cells and b cells differentiate into specific effector cells and localize at the site of infected for instance cd4t cells differentiate into th1 cells and produce ifn- to activate macrophages and other types of cells because of the induction of il12 thereby triggering defense against intracellular pathogens at the same time ifn- can induce the transcription of multiple chemokines besides il-6 induce the differentiation of cd8t cells into cytotoxic t cells which eliminated the viruses in the way of lysing infected cells suicide the consumption of cytotoxic t cells may be the cause of the decrease in lymphocytes in most patients with covid-198 it has been found t lymphocytes are a vital source of many chemokines and express multiple molecule receptors 39 such as neutrophils and macrophages are drawn to the region of injury by il-8 and mcp-1chemotactic influences respectively while secreting chemokines to recruit more cells to participate in the battle with pathogens it is now accepted that each cell can respond to multiple chemokines just by expressing a single type of receptor it is this complex relationship between chemokines and their receptors that makes chemokines rapidly replenish in various microenvironments and the inflammatory storm continues to develop 35 according a report the proinflammatory cytokines like tnf il-6 and chemokines il8 ccl3 mcp-1 ccl5 ccl2 and cxcl10 were significantly up-regulated while the anti-inflammatory factor such as il10 was lacking in sars patients31 which showed that the lack of anti-inflammatory factors can cause an imbalance in the inflammatory response and promote cytokine stormacute lung injury ali is a common consequence of cytokine storm in lung tissue and systemic circulation 40 recently pulmonary pathology of sars-cov-2 infection showed the major changes of the lung tissue showed diffuse alveolar damage alveolar edema and proteinaceous exudates thickening of alveolar walls evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation indicated ards 26 and multinucleated giant cells in the alveolar cavity inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in the pulmonary mesenchyme 27 in addition the patients pathological results confirmed that the number of cd4t and cd8t cells in peripheral blood reduced but over-activated the high proinflammatory effects th17 cells increased that concentrating ccr4ccr6 and cd8t cells contain high concentrations of cytotoxic granules mainly perforin and granulysin which can cause severe immune damage in patients 27 these evidences showed that patients with extensive acute lung injury and multiple organ failure which may be caused by the activation of the bodys immune system including innate immunity and adaptive immunity resulting in a strong inflammatory stormfrom the molecular modeling structural analysis results of 2019-ncov receptors the receptor binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 has more effective interaction with ace2 compared to sars-cov47 the binding of s protein to ace2 is the first step for the virus to enter target cells accomplished by proteolytic cleavage and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes 13 it was speculated that sars-cov-2 might also cause lung tissue injury in the same pathogenic mechanism 48 on the one hand when sars-cov-2 infects alveolar cells s1 and ace2 transmembrane domains combine to reduce the level of ace2 resulting in the renin angiotensin system ras tilts towards the ace-ang ii axis 49 meanwhile the production of ang ii is absolutely or relatively elevated which causing macrophagocyte infiltration inducing cytokines and adhesion molecules increase including il-6 monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 vcam-1 selectin e etc causing endothelial dysfunction 50 51 besides down-regulation of ace2 reduces protective effects against acute lung injury 49 leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability and pulmonary edema and severe patients may die of respiratory failure on the other hand cell experiment studies in vitro have shown that sars-cov s induces shedding of the ace2 extracellular ectodomain and promotes virus entry into cells through dependence on tnf- converting enzyme tace but the function of free sace2 is unknown currently which may also mediate inflammation and tissue injury 52 in addition the binding of virus and ace2 might also be involved in intracellular pathway recognitionpyroptosis is a new inflammatory form of programmed cell death inflammation storms caused by sars-cov-2 infection may be related to cell pyroptosis research evidences from chen et al showed that sars-cov viroporin 3a protein activates nlrp3 nod-like receptors protein 3 inflammasome causing il-1 production 53 reduced cell counts and increased il-1 in serum of covid-19 patients may indicated activation of cell pyroptosis when a variety of extracellular pamps are recognized by tlrs 54 which triggers activation of the nf-b signaling pathway and upregulation of inflammasome related components including inactivated nlrp3 proil-1 and proil-18 subsequently nlrp3 oligomerize and it was connected with the pro-caspase-1 through the adaptor protein asc to form a multiprotein complex thereby activating caspase-155 activated caspase-1 recruits and incises members of the polymerizes gasdermin family such as gsdmd in the pathway downstream56 simultaneously incises the precursors of il-1 and il-18 forming active il-1 and il18 which are released into the extracellular to recruit more inflammation cells to aggregate and expand the inflammatory response57 besides the active cleavage fragment of gsdmd caused extensive cell perforation by inserting into the lipid bilayer resulting in cell swelling and lysis which was followed by release of contents such as cellular matrix and cytokines 58 a mass of endogenous molecules from immune intracellular are released such as oxidized phospholipids and cellular matrix which are called damage-associated molecular patterns damp similar to pamp known as alarm singles they can also be recognized by nlrp3 thereby progressively magnify the inflammatory effects and cause cell pyroptosis59 figure 2
 covid-19 patients often have lymphopenia but further research is still needed to prove whether it is also related to this mechanismintracellular signaling mechanism of cell pyroptosis induced by pampsifn is a core family in innate antiviral immunity type i interferons ifn- and - are essential especially for the innate immune response against viruses and other microbial infections the binding of type i interferon and tis dimer receptor ifnar activates the jak-stat signal transduction pathway in which jak1 and tyk2 kinases phosphorylate stat1 stat2 and irf9 form a complex these complexes enter the nucleus and initiate the transcription of ifn-stimulated genes isg 60 in vitro studies have found that rapid replication of sars-cov in mice induces significant but delayed ifn- response accompanied by a large influx of pathogenic inflammatory mononuclear macrophages imm 61 leading to lung cytokines and chemokine increased vascular leakage and virus-specific t cell apoptosis further hinder virus clearance in addition studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses can rapidly replicate in host cells and encode proteins nsp1 that antagonizes ifns response by blocking stat1 phosphorylation 13 62 meanwhile structural proteins m and n inhibit ifns signaling by deactivating traf3 tbk1ikks and some other mechanisms respectively 63 the coronavirus structural and non-structural protein against the delayed response of ifns further amplifies the inflammatory response by promoting viral replication followed with the increase of viral pamps in turn the pamps inhibit delayed ifn signaling and stimulate prr-induced abnormal inflammatory responses 64 above all it should be clear that these putative antiviral mechanisms have been confirmed in step-by-step studies whether they are really important in infectious viruses and systemic antagonist pathways need to be further studiedgenerally considered that antiviral antibodies play a much important role in the viral clearance according to reports the response to anti-s-neutralizing antibodies nab in dead patients developed significantly faster 147 vs 20 days and higher level than patients who had recovered during sars 65 in a sars-cov macaque experimental model inoculated with s protein antibody it has been found that anti-s-igg facilitate severe lung injury in the early stages of infection via eliminates wound healing macrophage response and tgf- production as well as promote inflammatory macrophages and the production of factors mcp-1 and il-866 these evidences suggested that anti-s-igg may also play an important role in lung injury caused by acute sars-cov-2 infection during acute infection period 66 since fcr was blockaded reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines it is considered that the virus-anti-s-igg complex may promote cytokine release by binding to fc receptors on the surface of macrophages or additionally through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity adcc directly lyses target cells 67 whether this complex is associated with antibody-dependent enhancement ade 68 or complement system activation in patients with covid-19 during viral replication 55 remains to be proven by further studiesin sum the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has forced all medical institutions to carry out research and prevention and control worldwide all efforts are being made to slow the spread of covid-19 in order to provide better public-health recommendations and to develop timely diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines the mentioned above potential mechanisms are based on two outbreaks of coronavirus and current partial research 69 many new mechanisms still unknown new treatments are developed based on existing experience in combating viral infections however at present treatment strategies for sars-cov-2 infection are only supportive more important is no effective antiviral therapies for covid-19 here we assume and discuss that sars-cov-2 likely associate similar cytokines storm therapeutic interventions targeting these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may help alleviate adverse inflammatory responsescorticosteroids are usually used to suppress inflammation responses which were the main means of immunomodulatory therapy during the sars epidemic but the early patients were found increased plasma viral load and secondary infections 70 in some studies early administration of ifn is beneficial in reducing viral load and moderately improves clinical performance and combination with ribavirin also made certain therapeutic effect 71 ifn- inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of il-1 without excessive stimulation for the immune system which might become a potential therapeutic direction 72 besides the results from the management of patients with covid-19 by xu et al showed that an artificial liver blood purification system can quickly clear inflammation mediators to suppress cytokine storms however repair system may be delayed for excessive clarity 73 however these strategies still need to be tested for clinical effectiveness in addition there is evidence that the serine protease tmprss2 plays an important role in sars-cov-2 entry into cellular but tmprss2 inhibitors can prevent entry this may become a treatment option and more sars-cov-2 was neutralized by serum from recovery sars patients 41 showing a good therapeutic effect therefore the use of intravenous immunoglobulin may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation meanwhile which means that vaccine development may be the most effective means but current vaccine production faces many obstacles this requires researchers to explore via international cooperationstudies have found that there may be individual differences in susceptibility to cytokine storms the innate immune response of healthy people is highly variable which can be genetically confirmed the tlr receptor for example sepsis patients with single nucleotide polymorphisms snps of tlr1 hypermorphic variants which is associated with increased susceptibility to organ dysfunction death and gram-positive bacteremia infection 74 tlr4 is the major contributor to lipopolysaccharide lps and its variants can make individuals susceptible to sepsis genome-wide association studies gwas have linked tlr4 polymorphisms to pathogen susceptibility and disease severity 35 future researches likely reveal potential genetic variations that affect host cytokine storms during infection in addition the bodys immune pathological damage is closely related to the viral load and the degree of the cytokine storm is an essential connection point if plasma cytokines are monitored dynamically to assess the degree of cytokine storm timely and effectively which may be of great benefit to the care of critically ill patientsthe inflammatory response is an essential part of the immune system to function otherwise pathogen will be difficult to eliminate sars-cov-2 might induce excessive and prolonged cytokine responses resulting in lung damage and multiple organ failure so far most studies have focused on the direct measurement of those cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood but in the context of the rapidly changing cytokine environment after virus infection we have no round understanding the cause of the vigorous inflammatory response a comprehensive understanding of the factors although existing researches have shown that during the occurrence of pathogenic hcov infection the violent cytokine storm caused immune pathological damage and may be the real dead killer in critically ill patients at the same time human autopsy and animal models studies provided some evidences for the pathogenic mechanism of inflammatory cytokines derived from imm and neutrophils however current researches are limited and detailed molecular biology principles and broader epidemiology are lacking therefore future researches should not only focus on the identification of specific inflammatory response signaling pathways in patients and animals infected with hcov but of course include the scientific and effective application to control the spread of the virus worldwidethe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papersevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has infected over 4 million people worldwide resulting in a pandemic responsible for over 278000 deaths as of may 11 2020 12 the severity of coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to critical illness with up to one third of hospitalized patients requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit icu 3 4 5 6 fatality rates vary between demographic groups with old age and certain comorbidities hypertension obesity diabetes associated with higher riskin a subset of patients with severe covid-19 rapid progression of pulmonary infiltrates and multi-organ failure coincides with dramatic increases in inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical markers of inflammation consistent with a covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome covid-css 7 8 9 10 11 the high mortality rate associated with covid-css has led to the off-label use of targeted anti-cytokine therapies aimed at blocking the inflammatory cascade and improving patient outcomes clinical trials are being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of cytokine blockade in covid-19 currently there are no standard therapies for covid-19 or covid-css and recent national institutes of health nih guidelines have recommended against use of investigational agents outside of clinical trials 12 on may 1 2020 the united states food and drug administration fda have granted emergency use authorization for the anti-viral drug remdesivir based on the as-yet unpublished results of a national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid sponsored randomized control trial that demonstrated reduced recovery time compared to placebo 13 how this drug my influence cytokine storm and how the niaid trial compares to a prior study that found no benefit of the drug are currently not known 14covid-css has brought renewed attention to cytokine storm syndrome as a general concept 15 in 1993 perhaps influenced by the military operation desert storm the term cytokine storm was coined to describe the hypercytokinemia seen in graft-versus-host disease gvhd 1617 css has since been associated with viral infections eg influenza severe acute respiratory syndromesars autoimmune diseases eg systemic lupus erythematosussle systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritisjia hematologic conditions hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosishlh and medications 18 19 20 examples of the latter include the phase i clinical trial of tgn1412 an anti-cd28 monoclonal antibody that caused severe cytokine storm in healthy volunteers and the cytokine release syndrome crs following chimeric antigen receptor car-t cell therapy 2122 the wide heterogeneity of conditions that have been placed under this umbrella term underscore the need to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases characterized by hypercytokinemia recently css has been defined as a condition of dysregulation and perpetuated activation of lymphocytes and macrophages resulting in secretion of large quantities of cytokines leading to overwhelming systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure with high mortality 20understanding the hypercytokinemia and immune dysregulation associated with covid-19 is urgent some have proposed that covid-19 is actually a hypo-inflammatory vasculopathy rather than a cytokine storm this hypothesis is based on one study reporting relatively low interleukin-6 il-6 levels mean 25 pgml normal range  7 measured on admission to hospital in one chinese study 23 however cytokine storm is generally thought to develop later in the course of this disease and emerging data from our center and others indicates that patients with covid-css have a degree of hypercytokinemia ie il-6 levels 100 to 5000 pgml comparable to conditions such as car-t cell crs the overlap in clinical and biochemical features between covid-css and cytokine storm syndromes associated with other conditions may allow for insight into the underlying pathologic immune dysregulation in covid-css and inform strategies for therapeutic intervention in this review we summarize the clinical features pathologic mechanisms standard and investigational therapies for css in three well-defined hematological cytokine storm syndromes secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh idiopathic multicentic castleman disease imcd car-t cell crs in order to compare and contrast them with covid-csshlh is a hyperinflammatory syndrome of fever cytopenias and multi-organ dysfunction caused by uncontrolled immune activation and excessive cytokine production 24 primary hlh is typically a pediatric condition driven by germline mutations impairing granule-mediated cytotoxicity in natural killer and cytotoxic t cells 25 the secondary hlh syndromes observed in adults are most often driven by infection commonly viral such as epstein-barr virus ebv cytomegalovirus cmv or human immunodeficiency virus hiv malignancy lymphomas primary rheumatologic conditions termed macrophage activation syndrome-hlh subtype mas-hlh or medications immune checkpoint inhibitors lamotrigine 24 the hlh-2004 diagnostic criteria table 1
 developed for the pediatric population are recommended to guide diagnosis in adults and include soluble interleukin-2 receptor a marker of t cell activation as a cytokine-related diagnostic criterion 242627 the hlh-2004 criteria may be restrictive in identifying all patients that may benefit from immunomodulation the hscore was developed specifically for secondary and especially malignancy associated hlh in adults but unfortunately does not include any cytokine-related criteria 28 initially named for the hemophagocytosis seen on tissue biopsy hemophagocytosis in bone marrow aspirate is a common but non-specific feature in adults 2930 clinical and laboratory features include fevers often described as hectic in that they may exceed 40 c organomegaly cytopenias coagulopathy and profound hyperferritinemia often 10000 gl which often rapidly worsen despite initial empiric anti-microbial therapy resulting in eventual multisystem organ failure 2431 mortality remains high in adults around 70 despite therapy though patients with mas-hlh driven by rheumatologic diseases have better prognosis with less aggressive immunosuppression than other secondary hlh syndromes 2429castleman disease cd describes a group of syndromes with shared clinical hyperinflammation and histopathological features 32 diagnosis requires lymph node biopsy with characteristic histopathology as defined by consensus guidelines residing on a spectrum of histologic patterns from regressed germinal centers and prominent vascularization to hyperplastic germinal centers with prominent plasmacytosis 3233 idiopathic mcd is characterized by dysregulation of il-6 mediated inflammation typically occurring in the 5th and 6th decade of life patients present with lymphadenopathy in more than one lymph node station constitutional symptoms fluid accumulation and cytopenias 3233 liver or kidney dysfunction as well as the presence of secondary autoimmune phenomenon are also common 3234 the profound inflammation of the disease is reflected by a frequently observed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in the imcd-not otherwise specified imcd-nos subgroup 35 a subset of patients demonstrate a more aggressive clinical course with thrombocytopenia ascites reticulin fibrosis renal dysfunction and organomegaly tafro and do not exhibit the same hypergammaglobulinemia seen with imcd-nos 3235the engineering of car t-cells to bind tumour-specific epitopes and elicit cell-mediated death of malignant cells has been a major leap forward in cancer therapy first implemented in relapsed and refractory b-cell lymphoid malignancies cd19 car-t cell therapy has demonstrated response rates of 5090 in cd19 b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-hodgkin lymphoma 36 the activation of car-t cells after an encounter with target cells leads to release of granzyme and perforin proliferation of the car-t cell population and a supraphysiologic increase in cytokines such as il-6 and interferon- this cytokine release syndrome crs may occur in up to 70 of patients depending on conditioning therapy and cell construct with icu admission rates up to 13 36 37 38 crs is grade 12 in the majority of patients but may be severe in 1247 of patients 37 crs typically presents within the first 6 days following car-t cell infusion with fever as the defining feature followed by hypotension tachycardia hypoalbuminemia with capillary leak and weight gain and consumptive coagulopathy 3638 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans with a varied symptom profile table 1 may also be observed with later onset during an episode of crs or shortly after its resolution 3638 39 40 icans can also occur in patients who did not develop crs and this observation in addition to the separate timeline of development has resulted in the separation of icans from crs in the consensus grading system as a distinct toxicity 394142 crs may be observed after other tumour-directed immune therapies including the bi-specific t-cell engager drug blinatumumab 37for most people who contract covid-19 the clinical course is mild and often asymptomatic with the majority of those able to be recover from the disease at home individuals who require hospitalization most commonly present with fever cough fatigue and dyspnea 7 8 943 routine laboratory investigations on admission demonstrate lymphopenia elevated d-dimer and elevated crp chest imaging demonstrates bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacities 7 8 943 twelve to 31 of patients admitted to hospital will eventually develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and require critical care support 56943 severe covid-19 disease as per who-china working group definition includes the following respiratory frequency  30min blood oxygen saturation  93 pao2fio2 ratio  300 andor lung infiltrates 50 of the lung field within 2448 h 44 critical disease is defined as severe covid-19 with any of the following respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunctionfailure 44 while multi-organ failure is frequently reported in this population marked organomegaly has not been reported one of the emerging facets of severe covid-19 is the association with a hypercoagulable state d-dimer elevation was recognized early on in the pandemic to be an important prognostic marker for predicting severe disease and mortality 43 klok et al have reported a 31 incidence of thrombotic complications in covid patients admitted to the icu including demonstration of venous thromboembolism vte in 27 of patients 45 increased thrombotic risk is seen with many inflammatory states and reflects overlap in the regulation inflammation and thrombosis 46 the profound activation of thrombotic pathways may be a unique feature to covid-19 compared to other css but remains to be confirmed in further studiesin the pediatric population affected with covid-19 there have been emerging reports of a hyperinflammatory shock syndrome sharing features with an atypical kawasaki disease initial symptoms of fever conjunctivitis rash and gastrointestinal symptoms progress to shock requiring vasopressor support fluid accumulation and cardiac injury 47 the delayed-onset and profound rise in inflammatory markers suggest a secondary pathologic immune response that may share features with adult covid-css but further study is needed to confirm these observationsthere is no consensus definition of covid-css and it is prudent to recognize that not all patients with severe or critical covid-19 infection develop dysregulated immune response and toxic cytokine secretion 11 the working definition of covid-css at our institution used for consideration of adjunct immunomodulatory therapy is critical covid-19 with evidence of derangement of multiple inflammatory markers including ferritin 1000 gl and crp  100 mgl although we are presently analyzing other clinical and laboratory parameters and immune biomarkers such as il-1 and il-6 to produce a more nuanced definitionas the adult secondary hlh disorders result from many different etiologies and triggers an in-depth understanding of pathophysiology is lacking inferring from studies of the genetic defects in primary hlh patients the hlh syndrome results from the dysregulation and unrestrained activation of macrophages cytotoxic t-cells and nk cells leading to the observed end-organ damage 24253150 the inability to resolve certain infections and subsequent uncontrolled immune activation may explain the amplified inflammatory response in shlh from viral bacterial and fungal infections aberrant autonomous cytokine production from malignant cells of the immune system may develop into the hlh observed in lymphomas 242531 secondary hlh can complicate auto-inflammatory conditions sle stills disease etc with the inappropriate response to self-antigen driving continuous activation of t-cells and macrophages 2451 the observed responses to ifn- antibody therapy suggests this may be a key factor perpetuating the pathologic feedback loop of inflammation but murine models of primary hlh have implicated both ifn-  dependant and independent pathways 52 53 54the pathogenesis of imcd is less well understood than when the syndrome is driven by human herpesvirus 8 hhv-8 or poems increased il-6 is seen in the majority of patients and the response to il-6 targeted therapy has implicated dysregulation of this pathway as the main driver of disease 32 elevated vascular endothelial growth factor vegf levels and dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin mtor signaling are also observed in some patients 3255 the cause of the elevated il-6 levels and inappropriate inflammatory activation is not known associations of imcd and autoimmune and malignant conditions may point to shared pathophysiology while as-yet-undiscovered infectious triggers have also been hypothesizedthe development and severity of crs correlates with car-t cell expansion but preclinical mouse studies have also shown monocyte and macrophage production of il-1 and il-6 to be the major drivers of the inflammatory response 3856 57 58 subsequent endothelial activation results in microvascular permeability and the clinical features of capillary leak hypotension and reduced serum albumin levels 38 autopsy evidence also suggests activated endothelial cells produce additional il-6 reinforcing the pathologic inflammatory feedback loop 59 eventual blood-brain barrier disruption as a result of increased il-6 levels and endothelial activation is thought to contribute to severe icans 37our understanding of covid-css is rapidly evolving with early clinical biochemical and autopsy observations supplemented by more thorough preclinical studies of the closely related sars-cov responsible for the 2003 sars outbreak mouse models of sars-cov suggest that delayed type i interferon signaling promotes accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory macrophages leading to hypercytokinemia vascular leakage and impaired t cell responses 60 deleting the ifn-gamma receptor or depleting macrophages protected mice from lethal infection without affecting viral load supporting that the inflammatory response may contribute more to severe disease pathology than direct viral effects 60 in a subset of patients with covid-19 disease severity seems to correlate with inflammatory markers commonly implicated in other cytokine storm disorders including il-2r il-6 il-10 and tnf cytokines 7810 in patients with covid-css development of sepsis need for intubation and ards are accompanied by worsening inflammatory markers and are observed between 7 and 14 days after illness onset consistent with clinical deterioration due to inflammatory sequelae 43 an autopsy series from 6 patients who died from covid-19 demonstrated il-6 production by virus-infected macrophages present in lymph nodes and spleen tissue suggesting that viral-infection leading to macrophage production of il-6 was the initial trigger for inflammatory dysregulation 61corticosteroids have been the cornerstone in managing hyper-inflammatory disorders due to their broad effects leading to reduced inflammatory mediators and immune cell activity used alone or in combination with cytotoxic therapies responses are frequent but often short-lived and associated with significant long-term toxicity the hlh-94 protocol combines upfront dexamethasone with etoposide for its specific reduction of t cell activity and cytokine production 6263 cyclosporine may be introduced after 8 weeks or after 1 week as per the hlh-2004 protocol though it is often poorly tolerated in adult patients 2426 despite the demonstrated efficacy in pediatric hlh syndromes adults treated with the hlh-94 protocol and its variations demonstrate poor long-term survival around 30 24 relapses in secondary hlh occur frequently either despite standard therapy or as therapy intensity is tapered mortality related to infectious or other complications of prolonged immunosuppression is also commonin imcd corticosteroids are frequently used as adjunct therapy for disease flares though only half of patients will demonstrate improvement with corticosteroids 32 as high dose corticosteroid therapy is poorly tolerated in the long term a number of lymphoma-like chemotherapy options have be used to treat patients with imcd 32 steroid-containing immunomodulatory regimens with thalidomide cyclophosphamide and prednisone has also shown promising efficacy and safety 64the use of corticosteroids in the management of crs following car-t cells is limited by the concern of unwanted cytotoxic effects on the car-t product reducing overall efficacy however given its effectiveness for rapidly reducing the systemic inflammatory burden in this population corticosteroids are still used second-line after directed anti-cytokine therapy 3637 steroids are particularly useful as first line therapy in the treatment of icans with cns penetrating steroids such as dexamethasone preferredcorticosteroids were used frequently in the management of covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic in china with reported use in 3079 of patients 47 8 94365 the indication for therapy is not widely reported and may be due to comorbid conditions copd asthma or as adjunct therapy for sepsis analysis has suggested improved outcomes in patients with ards treated with steroids though this has not been conclusive and ideal timing and patient selection are not known 94366 animal models and some human data of the closely related sars-cov infection have demonstrated early corticosteroid use may reduce initial inflammatory response but raise the concern of increased viral replication and shedding that could worsen clinical outcomes and increase viral transmission 6768improved mechanistic understanding of hyperinflammatory syndromes has led to therapies targeting specific cytokines implicated in disease pathogenesis emapalumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting interferon- that has demonstrated efficacy with overall response rates over 60 in a study of pediatric hlh 69 based on this trial the us food and drug administration fda approved emapalumab for use in refractory recurrent or progressive primary hlh in both children and adults 22 though there is a concern of secondary infections particularly from organisms responsive to ifn-gamma driven immune reactions the medication has been well tolerated in the majority of patients including those with infectious complications prior to therapy 546970 data are limited in the use of emapalumab for secondary hlh in adultsin imcd the disease process is thought to be dependent on elevated il-6 levels perpetuating the hyperinflammatory state in most patients therefore use of il-6 targeted therapy is now the front-line management for patients with imcd with or without adjunctive steroids siltuximab a monoclonal antibody directed against il-6 in a placebo controlled trial has shown reduction in tumour burden and symptomatic response in a third 34 of patients with responders having sustained disease control up to 6 years of follow-up 71 tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody directed against the il-6 receptor has demonstrated similar improvement in symptoms and biochemical markers of disease activity in a single arm study 72 anti-il-6 therapy is well tolerated for many years in patients with disease response though relapses may be common following cessation of therapy 3272the early observation of a substantial increase in il-6 during crs prompted the introduction of anti-il-6 agents for management of those receiving car-t therapy with good effect 73 tocilizumab is now fda approved for use in crs with response rates of 70 following 12 doses with a median time to response of 4 days 2237 doses can be repeated every 6 to 24 h until crs symptoms begin to improve as tocilizumab is only used in short courses for a limited period there is less concern of serious adverse events that may be seen in patients taking the drug long-term for rheumatologic indications tocilizumab administration has been demonstrated to not affect car-t cell efficacy and is thus the preferred first line agent over corticosteroids tocilizumab appears to be not as effective for icans likely because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and targets the il-6 receptor with no direct il-6 lowering effect leading to elevated systemic il-6 levels after therapy without cns protection 384072 direct targeting of il-6 by siltuximab may have better cns response though this has not been studied in clinical trialsas il-6 levels correlate with disease severity in hospitalized covid-19 patients anti-il-6 therapy has been one of the first treatment strategies explored during the pandemic 7 8 9 10 there have been several published case reports as a well as two larger case series from china using tocilizumab as a treatment for severe covid-19 demonstrating biochemical efficacy with decrease markers of inflammation but the impact of clinical outcomes such as time in intensive care and mortality compared to supportive care remains unknown 74 75 76 77 78 79 a recent large series of 100 consecutive patients with severe covid-19 demonstrated clinical stability or improvement in 77 of patients following administration of tocilizumab 80 a press release for corimuno-toci nct04331808 a multi-centre open-label randomized controlled trial of tocilizumab in moderate and severe covid19 has suggested positive results and with the study currently under peer-review 81 optimal timing of tocilizumab initiation is unknown but there is sound rationale that earlier treatment in patients demonstrating a pathologic inflammatory response may ameliorate immune-mediated lung injury repeated doses of tocilizumab similar in strategy to its use in car-t cell related crs may be reasonable for patients with refractory covid-css serious risks of tocilizumab in the short term include a small risk of bowel perforation acute hepatic failure and osteonecrosis of the jaw 8283 case reports of hypertriglyceridemia and candidemia following tocilizumab infusion for covid-19 have been reported 8485 there is a concern that the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 could increase the risk of secondary infections and delay viral clearance as was postulated in the report of 2 cases of viral myocarditis following tociluzumab for covid-19 86 these safety concerns should be thoroughly evaluated in future studies clinical trials of tocilizumab siltuximab and sarilumab an il-6 receptor blocker are currently being conducted in patients with moderate and severe covid-19 though trials specifically evaluating these agents in the covid-css population are not yet plannedin addition to their well-known anticoagulant properties heparins are known to have anti-inflammatory effects with lowering of il-6 levels specifically described 87 88 89 in patients with covid-19 a retrospective study has observed reduction of il-6 levels in patients treated with low-molecular weight heparin lmwh 90 given the maturing evidence of increased thrombotic risk in covid-19 lmwh may be a good adjunct therapy for covid-css to reduce both il-6 driven inflammation and thrombotic risk optimal dosing strategies in patients without proven thromboembolic disease is not currently known but is being investigated in upcoming clinical trials nct04359277il-1-receptor blockade with anakinra has been used in case series and retrospective studies for hlh with a clinical trial currently ongoing 91 92 93 anakinra has been hypothesized to have utility for car-t crs and neurotoxicity based on the observation that il-1 elevations precede il-6 spike in murine crs models and treatment with anakinra therapy resulted in reduction of both cytokines 5658 anakinra has the added benefit of having a very short half-life compared to other anti-cytokine therapies a retrospective cohort study of 29 patients with covid-19 and moderate-to-severe ards and hyperinflammation crp 100 mgl andor ferritin 900 ngml treated with high dose anakinra demonstrated clinical improvement in 72 of patients and improved survival compared to historical controls 94tnf inhibiting agents are available for the management of other inflammatory conditions though at the time of this review no reports of tnf inhibition have been reported for covid-19 the use of tnf inhibitors has some potential concern these drugs have also been thought to trigger shlh in some case reports 95 96 97 clinical trials for tnf inhibition in covid-19 are plannedto implement cellular responses to cytokines cell surface receptors must connect these external environmental signals to the nucleus to guide gene expression cell proliferation and activity this bottle-neck of inflammatory communication through shared internal signaling molecular pathways has facilitated the creation of targeted therapies that inhibit multiple cytokine pathways simultaneously many cytokine and growth receptors signal through the janus kinase jak signal transducer of activators of transcription stat pathway this has spurred the development of small molecular jak inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory and neoplastic conditions 98 these agents may be advantageous for disease states in which broader inhibition of cytokine signaling is required to control inflammation compared to the targeted blockade of single cytokinesruxolitinib a jak12 inhibitor already approved for the therapy of myeloproliferative neoplasm and rheumatologic disorders has activity in murine hlh models by reducing inflammation through ifn- dependant and independent pathways this results in reduced activity and tissue infiltration of t-cells and neutrophils 5253 case series in relapsedrefractory hlh as well as a single case of upfront therapy for moderate severity hlh have described biochemical and clinical efficacy in treatment of hlh with ruxolitinib monotherapy 99 100 101 early phase clinical trials are ongoing but preliminary results have demonstrated biochemical hematologic and clinical recovery in the few patients enrolled thus far 102 importantly the treatment is tolerated well with few adverse events reported especially in contrast to standard regimens of prolonged chemotherapy combined with high dose steroidspatients with the tafro subtype of imcd will typically have a more aggressive course and most have no substantial response to il-6 blockade analysis of molecular signaling pathways active in imcd patients refractory to anti-il-6 agents has implicated downstream activation of the pi3kaktmtor pathway common to signaling of the t cell receptor and vegf pathways 103 use of the mtor inhibitor sirolimus has met with early success in limited numbers of patients and a clinical trial in il-6 blockade refractory tafro patients is underway 3255103 pre-clinical studies of cells obtained from patients with imcd have also indicated that jak inhibitors may be able to interrupt il-6 driven mtor pathway activation 55currently there are limited reports of the use of jak-stat or other cell signaling pathway inhibitors in the management of covid-css the use of jak inhibitors is attractive as the medications are well tolerated have short half-lives and have the potential to target numerous inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously while ruxolitinib has been the agent most studied in hlh other jak inhibitors may have potential advantages baricitinib an oral jak12 inhibitor that is currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was recently identified by artificial intelligence-based technology as a potential immunomodulatory treatment strategy for sars-cov-2 104 at therapeutic doses baricitinib is predicted to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and viral entry into cells by blocking the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 104 aak1 regulates endocytosis in numerous cell types expressing ace2 the receptor that mediates sars-cov-2 viral entry including lung at2 alveolar epithelial cells 104 because any agent that dampens the inflammatory response could lead to a potential loss of immune-mediated viral control the hypothesized anti-viral effect makes baricitinib an attractive investigational therapy over agents that target disordered inflammation alone of concern with baracitinib is the increased risk of thrombosis which may increase the rate of thrombotic complications already observed with covid-19 105 clinical experience with covid-19 is limited but a pilot study of 12 patients has demonstrated improvement in fever dyspnea and hypoxia with a lower rate of icu admission than a historical control cohort 106ferritin the iron storage protein and c-reactive protein crp are the acute phase reactants most widely available at hospitals for monitoring systemic inflammation hyperferritinemia is the most common feature to prompt further evaluation for secondary hlh with levels 10000 gl observed in 789 of adult patients and can frequently be in excess of 100000 gl 27107 patients with crs also demonstrate elevated ferritin levels with most patients reaching a peak over 3000 and many in excess of 10000 gl 3857 patients experiencing higher grade crs have greater median peak ferritin and crp though with significant overlap in the observed ranges 3857 similarly ferritin and crp levels in patients with covid-19 are reportedly higher in patients with severe compared to moderate disease and in patients who died compared to those that recovered 7810 in our experience with covid-css patients in the icu we have observed ferritin levels in the range of 100010000 gl with crp levels typically above 100 mgl hoiland r et al manuscript under reviewthe measurement of d-dimer a fibrin degradation product is a widely available test that shows active clot formation and breakdown its increase in systemic inflammation reflects the overlap between the physiologic inflammatory and thrombotic pathways though not frequently used in the evaluation of the cytokine storm disorders it has been correlated with severity of crs following car-t 38 d-dimer levels correlate with disease severity in covid-19 and admission d-dimer 1 gml has emerged as one of the earliest prognostic marker to identify patients with high mortality 43the pattern of inflammatory markers may be more useful than relying on absolute values alone in order to establish a diagnosis in children with sjia the ratio of ferritin to erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr was useful for identifying patients with mas 108 in one study of japanese hlh cases a ratio of sil-2r to ferritin was predictive of those with lymphoma-associated rather than benign disease 109the soluble interleukin-2 receptor sil2r level is integrated into the hlh-2004 diagnostic criteria 26

levels have not been widely reported on in imcd but one study found elevated levels in 20 of 21 cases 34 additionally it was observed that for patients on anti-il-6 therapy sil-2r was one of the earliest markers that predicted disease relapse and failure of therapy 34110 in car-t crs it has been observed that sil2r levels are markedly elevated in patients with severe compared to non-severe disease 57 patients with covid-19 demonstrate higher sil2r levels in those with severe and fatal disease though levels have thus far reported to be typically less than 2000 uml 7810111il-6 is a key cytokine common to the pathophysiology of most css disorders and has important therapeutic implications in hlh data available in pediatric patients demonstrate moderate il-6 elevation though it has not been useful in distinguishing hlh from sepsis or other inflammatory conditions 112 idiopathic mcd is conceptualized as a primarily a disorder of il-6 elevation though serum il-6 levels in imcd may be normal or only mildly elevated response rates to il-6 blockade do correlate with baseline il-6 levels in imcd but many patients with low il-6 levels will improve with therapy while patients with high il-6 levels can show no response 3271 il-6 levels peak with disease flares in imcd and can be used to monitor disease course but once il-6 blockade is initiated serial monitoring is not useful tocilizumab and sarilumab block the receptor for il-6 leading to clinical improvement while serum il-6 levels will remain stable or increase 72 similarly il-6 levels cannot be accurately interpreted for 1218 months following the last dose of siltuximab car-t crs demonstrates substantial increases in il-6 that correlates with severity of crs and may be orders of magnitude greater the levels reported for imcd and hlh 3871112 in covid-19 il-6 levels have been high for patients with more severe and fatal disease 7810111 in our institutions experience with covid-css observed levels of il-6

downstream targets of interferon such as cxcl9 and cxcl10 appear to have utility in monitoring disease activity and treatment response 5470use of cytokine measurements in css to diagnose and monitor disease activity and response to therapy is an area in need of further refinement monitoring response to therapy requires in depth knowledge of drug targets and expected impact on cytokine levels

future goals for css include improved access to immunophenotyping and expression profiling to inform our understanding of disease mechanisms and enhancing diagnostic and monitoring capabilitiesdue to the lack of currently available evidence the nih guidelines for the management of covid-19 do not recommend for or against cytokine inhibition with il-1 and il-6 blockade and specifically recommend against off-label use of jak pathway inhibitors outside of clinical trial 12 current industry sponsored trials of sarilumab nct04327388 and tocilizumab nct04320615 in patients with severe-critical covid-19 are underway however they exclude critically ill patients requiring vasopressors and therefore will not address the question of whether these agents will be of benefit in those who are

tissue resident and blood-derived macrophages are key contributors in the inflammatory response to viral infections and the pro-inflammatory precursors of ards 26 alveolar macrophages are the predominant tissue resident immune cells found in the lung and are likely to be involved in both the early anti-viral response and trophic end-stages of tissue damage and recovery in addition pleiotropic monocytes invading across the capillary-epithelial bed will differentiate into pro-inflammatory m1 macrophages upon arrival and may contribute to the excessive immune response in the lung 26 moreover macrophages that develop into an inflammatory m1 lineage become a potent source of inflammatory cytokines eg tnf il-1 il-6 il-12 cxcl10 furthering inflammation 26 27 of note the balance of macrophage polarization between the microbialifn-induced m1 phenotypes and the anti-inflammatory m2 could dictate the amplitude of classical activation versus neutrophil efferocytosis and immune resolution respectively during pulmonary insult 28in vitro studies using human macrophages further support an immunomodulatory action with lmwf5a treatment by shifting macrophage phenotypes from an inflammatory m1 lineage to an anti-inflammatory m2 lineage 21 in these experiments a human thp-1 monocyte cell line was differentiated to induce macrophage-like characteristics then treated with lmwf5a and stimulated with lps reductions in both secreted cytokine and mrna transcription were observed for the m1 markers il-6 cxcl10 and il-12 importantly the same cells exhibited an increase in the release of the anti-inflammatory m2 marker il-10 with lmwf5a treatment as compared to saline controls the reduction in inflammatory m1-type cytokine release and gene expression combined with increased anti-inflammatory m2-type cytokine release indicates lmwf5a modulates the immune response by shifting the cytokine profile towards homeostasis this shift in macrophage phenotype could reduce macrophage hyperactivity and partially address the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines observed in covid-19although covid-19 may be characterized as an innate response studies also indicate that adaptive cells contribute to the etiology of lung jury as well animal models demonstrate that t-cells facilitate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf and the arrival of neutrophils in the lung 29 as observed with macrophage polarization this may result from an imbalance in inflammatory and regulatory subsets for example the ratio of pro-inflammatory th17 to t regulatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of patients has been found to be predictive of 28-day mortality with ards 30 in support of this evidence activated and proliferating pro-inflammatory t-cells have been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from ards patients 31 moreover lymphocyte counts have been associated with increased disease severity in covid-19 with patients who die exhibiting significant leukopenia 32 these cells represent a potentially underappreciated source of both ifn and proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf and contributors of disease progression in covid-19 once in the lung inf priming of t-cells will provide for intense superantigen-like signaling that may exacerbate autocrine and paracrine cytokine activity while their role in covid-19 is yet to be fully elucidated targeting persistent and long-lived immune regulators such as t cells could prove valuable in balancing the immune responseone of the earliest documented activities of lmwf5a is its ability to reduce cytokine release from immune cells stimulated through the t-cell receptor tcr by cd328 antibody or specific antigen presentation lmwf5a was found to reduce tnf and ifn release from cd328-stimulated pbmc and influenza ha antigen-presented human t-cell clones 17 this activity was attributed in part to an identified diketopiperazine molecule formed by the cleavage and cyclization of the two n-terminal amino acids of human serum albumin da-dkp present in lmwf5a treatment of these cells with da-dkp resulted in significant reductions of tnf and ifn release from antigen presented t-cells clones 18 interestingly this effect appears to be specific to memory cd45ro but not nave cd45ra phenotypes unpublished findings these findings demonstrated that lmwf5a can reduce cytokine release during an adaptive immune response triggered by the presentation of antigen or activation of t-cells therefore with respect to covid-19 lmwf5a may shift the overall inflammatory response away from the hyper-cytokine production observed as the disease transitions to ards without impacting the bodys ability to fight the primary viral infectionmechanistically covid-19 pathogenesis seems to be conducted through distinct transcriptional signaling pathways for example activation of nf-b appears to be a hallmark of alveolar macrophages found in patients during ards 33 more importantly inhibition of nf-b has been shown to limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like il-6 and cxcl10 in mouse models resulting in reduced mortality 34 dysregulation of nf-b activity has been broadly implicated in the production of inflammatory cytokines tnf il-1 il-6 and cell apoptosis 3537 also it has been reported that nf-b signaling pathways can coordinate with other hallmark pro-inflammatory transcription factors in the immune response 38another pro-inflammatory transcription factor associated with lung inflammation is signal transducer and activator of transcription stat the canonical ifn signaling pathway involves the activation of janus kinase and stat1 which promotes m1 polarization of macrophages and augments tcr signaling priming 39 stat1 and stat3 activation has also been shown to be a driving factor in lps-induced lung injury by mediating the release of il-6 and tnf 40 supporting this mechanism inhibition of stat3 reduces the accumulation of immune cells as well as the amount of detectable tnf and il-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in lps-induced mouse lung ali models 41several lines of preliminary evidence demonstrate that lmwf5a reduces the activity of both nf-b and stat nf-b luciferase hek293 reporter cells treated with lmwf5a and then stimulated with tnf exhibit dose-dependent reductions in nf-b expression as measured by luciferase activity as for stat preliminary experiments using the lps-stimulated human pbmc model described above indicate that lmwf5a reduces stat1 and stat3 activation as measured by dna-binding elisa in nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions taken from cells after 24 h in culture while these findings need to be fully evaluated reduction in nf-b activity could reduce the overall inflammatory status of covid-19 patients while a reduction in stat could provide an avenue to help suppress the robust ifn and m1 signaling that appears to trigger the cytokine storm development in these patientsconversely lmwf5a appears to activate the anti-inflammatory andor immunoregulatory transcription factors aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ppar a source of endogenous ahr ligands are tryptophan metabolites and one of the active ingredients in lmwf5a is n-acetyl-tryptophan suggesting that ahr activation contributes to the immunomodulatory action of lmwf5a the effect on ahr activity was confirmed using an ahr antagonist ch223191 in the thp-1 model described above when an ahr antagonist was added to these macrophage-like cultures the il-6 response was partially attenuated demonstrating that the ahr activation plays a partial role in the reducing of cytokine observed in this model however ahr antagonism had no significant effect on cxcl10 inhibition indicating other pathways are involved in lmwf5a activity as well 21 another target pathway for activity was identified based on the fact that endogenous ppar ligands are comprised of fatty acids and their derivatives and lmwf5a contains the fatty acid caprylate furthermore 15-delta prostaglandin j2 15d-pgj2 a resolving prostaglandin known to be a natural ligand for ppar is upregulated by lmwf5a to be discussed more below to establish the contribution of ppar in our models dna-binding and pathway specific antagonism was evaluated preliminary findings suggest that human pbmc treated with lmwf5a exhibited increased ppar dna binding and the addition of the ppar antagonist gw9662 to these cultures results in the attenuation of the lps-induced tnf inhibition together these data indicate that both ahr and ppar transcriptional pathways play a role in the anti-inflammatory responses observed by lmwf5aa large body of evidence suggests that ahr and ppar signaling plays a pivotal role in immunosuppression and the direction of regulatory immune cell phenotypes to illustrate ahr has been shown to suppress nf-b activity by increasing dna binding of the nf-b subunit p50 p50p50 nf-b homodimer to competitively inhibit the active p50 nf-b subunit p65 rela heterodimer 42 sequestering co-regulators rela nf-b subunit relb to prevent translocation into the nucleus 43 and direct trans-repression in the presence of stat1 44 ahr also promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine production il-10 il-21 and the differentiation of t-cells to regulatory phenotypes through cross-talk with the transcription factors proto-oncogene c-maf and stat3 45 46 as with ahr ppar has been shown to suppress nf-b activity by binding to dna and directly interacting with the rela and p50 subunits of nf-b inducing the expression of inhibitor nf-b protein sequestering coactivators required for nf-b such as creb-binding protein and releasing the repressor b-cell lymphoma 6 protein which redirects its activity towards nf-b-mediated promoters 47 this activity decreases the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated by the nf-b pathway including tnf and il-6 47 48 more importantly the ppar agonist rosiglitazone is protective of endotoxin induced ards in rat models with marked reductions in nitric oxide and oxidative damage observed 49 based on these results we suspect that activation of these pathways could help suppress the release of key cytokines such as il-6 during covid-19 provide additional control over pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and potentially rebalance inflammatory immune cells to regulatory and immunotolerant phenotypes that appear to be missing in critical stages of ardsone of the unique aspects of lmwf5a-induced immunomodulation is the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines concomitant with the enhancement of pro-resolving molecules in our lps-stimulated pbmc investigations we found that unlike the steroid dexamethasone which reduces cytokine and prostaglandin release lmwf5a inhibits tnf release while potentiating the production of pro-resolving prostaglandin e2 pge2 and 15d-pgj2 in these cultures fig 2 20 on the other hand treatment with ibuprofen a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug strongly attenuates prostaglandin release but does not result in a significant reduction in tnf release consequently lmwf5a offers a distinctive immunomodulatory profile to other hallmark anti-inflammatory drugs western blot analysis shows that lmwf5a accomplishes this by upregulating prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 cox-2 expression 20 a similar pge2 response is observed in macrophage-like cell culture models using pma-differentiated u937 monocytic cells stimulated with lps suggesting that while lmwf5a can suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines healing and resolution phase mediators are still produced and possibly enhanced by treatment
in regard to covid-19 it is now appreciated that cox-2 plays a critical role in protection through the resolution phase of inflammation hangai et al found that pge2 release from necrotic macrophages may represent a mechanism to suppress damp-induced inflammation and that inhibition of cox-2 results in elevated serum tnf levels in liver necrotic models 50 interestingly studies have also shown that pge2 in the wound site is sufficient to drive the reverse migration of neutrophils as well as promote the apoptosis of neutrophils and efferocytosis critical for the resolution phase of the inflammatory process 51 the authors further hypothesized that this activity is temporally important in part to allow neutrophils to perform critical functions then provide timely resolution while it is certain that damp signaling has evolved to help achieve homeostasis after insult or injury excessive andor sustained responses can exacerbate disease as a result compensatory mechanisms exist within the biologic milieu and it appears that lmwf5a may help drive lipid-mediated feed-back loops of immunosuppressionmore importantly this pathway also appears critical to viral immunity and may afford some protection from the robust inflammation in late phase viral infection that leads to ards for example in some coronavirus studies it has been shown that the virus manipulates prostaglandin release from infected cells during different phases of infection fang et al showed that sars-cov achieves this is by membrane protein-induced down regulation of nf-b with a resulting reduction in cox-2 expression 52 the authors suggest that this is a protective measure by the virus to evade the immune response in the early stages of infection in addition the host response with these molecules also appears to dictate disease progression to illustrate in mouse studies age-related differences in pgd2 release result in defective migration of dendritic cells and cytotoxic cd8 t-cell activity into the lung 53 furthermore it has also been found that anti-inflammatory pgd2 signaling through d-prostanoid receptor 1 reduces inflammasome-induced il-1 release and mortality in coronavirus-infected mice 54 finally influenza studies have established that 15d-pgj2 treatment protects mice against lethal influenza infection through a ppar-dependent mechanism with a marked reduction in viral load and lung inflammation observed 55 it has been theorized that bioactive lipids such as arachidonic acid may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds thus together with the findings above prostaglandins could provide a therapeutic advantage for ards secondary to viral infections such as covid-19 56there are many clinical parameters that may contribute to the pathogenesis and morbidity associated with covid-19 one of these is dysregulation of the alveolar-epithelial barrier which results in the build-up of protein-rich fluid and decreased oxygen diffusion resolution and repair of the widespread inflammation characteristic of ards depends not only on clearance of infiltrating immune cells and suppression of inflammation but also on removal of fluid and restoration of barrier function interventions that enhance barrier function should provide a rational approach for the treatment and prevention of covid-19research findings suggest that lmwf5a may protect barrier integrity in several ways first and expanding on an intrinsic ability described above prostaglandins and cox-2-derived mediators also appear to promote the recovery of barrier function in both endothelial and epithelial cells to illustrate pge2 release from lps-stimulated a549 epithelial cells acting through pge2 receptor ep4 has been shown to enhance microvascular endothelial cell barrier function 57 moreover murine models indicate that cox-2 derived mediators are protective of acid-induced ali and that selective inhibition delays resolution 58 thus the authors propose that increased cox-2 activity could provide some level of protection against the edema associated with ali 58equally significant lmwf5a and its component da-dkp have been found to impact the activity of enzymes that link extracellular signals to cytoskeletal rearrangements known as small guanosine triphosphate hydrolases gtpases proteomic analysis and pulldown assays of human t-cells stimulated through the tcr shows that da-dkp elevates the phosphorylation and activity of the gtpase ras-related protein rap-1 rap-1 as compared to controls 18 changes in the activity of other gtpases are also observed in bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stems cells bmmsc treated with lmwf5a following treatment with lmwf5a bmmsc exhibit a rapid reduction in the intracellular level of active ras homolog family member a rhoa together with an increase in rac family small gtpase 1 rac1 22 finally da-dkp treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells appears to reduce rhoa activation induced by thrombin unpublished findings this body of evidence provides support for the idea that lmwf5a treatment can rapidly regulate gtpase activity in culturethese molecular switches are intimately linked to a variety of cell processes that help regulate the barrier function of both endothelial and epithelial cells of critical importance specific exchange protein activated by camp epac activation of rap-1 both prevents and reverses dysregulation of vascular function induced by inflammatory cytokines through stabilization of cytoskeletal components 59 as seen in endothelial cells epithelial cell gtpase activity dictates the arrangements and status of f-actin cytoskeletal elements and cellular junction proteins 60 it is important to note there is relevance of this finding to covid-19 as studies on the pathology of severe coronavirus-induced ardsali hypothesize that alveolar damage is dependent on a balance between coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways 61 interestingly viral infection also appears to activate rhoa activity in some models 62 because one of the underlying features of ards secondary to covid-19 is the breakdown of the endothelial-epithelial barrier in the alveoli this activity could provide a potential avenue to reduce the influx of fluid into alveolar spacesan ancillary cytoskeletal rearrangement has also been observed following lmwf5a treatment of human retinal endothelial cells when treated these cells observe a rapid increase in acetylated -tubulin a modification associated with stabilization and longevity of polymerized microtubules fig 3a 24 this post-translational modification attributed to the release of ca2 from intracellular stores in this model can be detected in these cells in as little as 30 min post-treatment and persists for 24 h fig 3b 24 to put this in perspective destabilization of microtubules has been shown to be an integral endothelial barrier dysfunction as a result innate immune signaling and oxidative stress 63 moreover inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 resulting in the acetylation of -tubulin has been shown to reduce lps-induced lung injury by down regulating caspase 1 activity resulting in lowered il-1 levels 64 ergo microtubule stabilization has a documented anti-inflammatory and barrier enhancement effect in the lung
the potential biologic relevance of this lmwf5a activity can be seen in functional assays of barrier activity and in the microscopic examination of cytoskeletal rearrangements treatment of both endothelial and epithelial monolayers with da-dkp increases barrier function for extended periods of time as measured by increased trans endothelial electrical resistance moreover da-dkp also attenuates rapid increases in permeability promotes cortical f-actin rearrangement and reduces stress-fiber formation following thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells this activity is suggested to be dependent on epac1 an exchange factor for the aforementioned small gtpase rap-1 and ve-cadherin organization unpublished findings altogether these data on the molecular mechanisms and more general functional effects of lmwf5a demonstrate how this biologic may prove useful for the treatment of lung vasogenic edema by enhancing the alveolar-epithelial barrier via altering gtpase activity promoting cortical f-actin rearrangement and stabilizing the microtubule networkto explore the use of lmwf5a for this indication a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized lmwf5a in adults with ards secondary to covid-19 infection supplement 1 was developed and is under review by the center for biologics evaluation and research division of the food and drug administration briefly this trial is designed to enroll up to ten 10 patients randomized 11 to nebulized lmwf5a plus standard of care soc for ards active arm n  5 or soc for ards control arm n  5 the primary trial objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nebulized lmwf5a in patients with ards secondary to covid-19 infection the secondary trial objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of nebulized ampion versus control in improving the clinical course and outcomes of patients with ards secondary to covid-19 infection including mortality ventilator free days and pao2fio2 ratioif successful this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality increase ventilation free days improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit this initial study will be followed by larger randomized controlled trial in covid-19 positive patients exhibiting respiratory distress and might avoid the need of mechanical ventilationin conclusion in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of lmwf5a make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in covid-19severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus that emerged in december 2019 in wuhan china and is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the most frequent clinical presentation of severe covid-19 is pneumonia with fever cough and dyspnoea the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that of 44500 confirmed infections the majority of infected patients 80 experienced mild disease with either no or only mild pneumonia 14 developed severe disease with dyspnoea hypoxia or greater than 50 lung involvement on imaging tests and 5 developed critical disease characterized by respiratory failure systemic shock or multi-organ failure1 approximately 2030 of patients who have been hospitalized with covid-19-associated pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support23 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a common complication of severe viral pneumonia including pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov4 in a group of 1099 patients hospitalized with covid-19 ards was reported to occur in 156 of patients with severe pneumonia5 a recent study from the new york area which has emerged as the epicentre of the pandemic in the united states reported that of 2634 patients who were hospitalized with confirmed covid-19 between 1 march and 4 april 2020 142 of patients were treated in intensive care units icus 122 of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and 21 of patients died mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 8816the factors that trigger severe illness in individuals infected with sars-cov-2 are not completely understood and the development of severe disease does not seem to be solely related to viral load and could involve a defective interferon response7 an excessive inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 is thought to be a major cause of disease severity and death in patients with covid-19 ref8 and is associated with high levels of circulating cytokines profound lymphopenia and substantial mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs heart9 spleen lymph nodes and kidney1011 as observed in post-mortem analysisgiven that the morbidity and mortality seen in covid-19 is associated with excessive inflammation a better understanding of the immunological underpinnings of the differential responses seen in patients infected with sars-cov-2 is necessary to better identify therapeutic targets dozens of immunomodulatory agents are rapidly going into clinical trials as well as already being used routinely in the clinic in an off-label manner without a thorough understanding of which particular inflammatory pathways and cell types represent the best targets some of these strategies could have detrimental effects in certain patients andor at different stages of covid-19 disease in this progress article we discuss the nature of the inflammatory responses that have been detected so far in patients with covid-19 in particular we highlight the emerging roles of monocytes and macrophages in the pathology of covid-19almost all patients with covid-19 present with lung involvement as evidenced by chest radiography whereas severe complications  such as ards and death  are only observed in a subgroup of patients although observational studies reported older age and the presence of comorbidities as risk factors for increased disease severity in patients with covid-19 it rapidly became clear that severe disease can also occur in younger patients with no pre-existing medical conditions higher levels of inflammatory markers in blood including c-reactive protein ferritin and d-dimers an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio11213 and increased serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines31417 have been associated with disease severity and death the systemic cytokine profiles observed in patients with severe covid-19 show similarities to those observed in cytokine release syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome with increased production of cytokines such as il-6 il-7 and tumour necrosis factor tnf and also of inflammatory chemokines including cc-chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 ccl3 and cxc-chemokine ligand 10 cxcl10 as well as of the soluble form of the -chain of the il-2 receptor this has led to the hypothesis that dysregulated activation of the mononuclear phagocyte mnp compartment contributes to covid-19-associated hyperinflammation818 levels of il-6 are often increased in the sera of patients with severe disease but most studies including unpublished observations from our own laboratories mm and jcm have not seen increased serum il-1 levels in patients with covid-19 including in patients with severe disease whether the discrepancy between il-6 and il-1 levels seen in patients with covid-19 reflects technical limitations or localized tissue production of cytokines or indicates the absence of inflammasome activation requires further clarification measurement of systemic il-18 as well as local measurement of il-1 and il-18 should better assess the role of inflammasome activation in covid-19 pathophysiologyas is seen in infections with other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses a common feature in many patients with covid-19 is the presence of a global t cell lymphopenia which is more pronounced in the cd8 t cell compartment and is particularly prominent in patients with severe disease although it is possible that the reduced levels of circulating t cells in patients may reflect their massive recruitment to inflamed tissues or the use of steroid treatment to mitigate inflammation some studies have reported significant t cell depletion from the secondary lymphoid organs of patients infected with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 refs1019 the potential mechanisms responsible for t cell depletion are still poorly understood but are not likely to be related to direct infection of t cells by the virus at least in the case of patients with covid-19 for which no evidence supports possible t cell infection by sars-cov-2 ref10 serum levels of tnf il-6 and il-10 negatively correlated with t cell numbers20 in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling tunel staining revealed high levels of lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleens and lymph nodes of patients who had died from covid-19 and this was associated with increased expression of the death receptor fas suggesting that activation-induced cell death aicd may cause t cell lymphopenia10 because t cells exert major functions in viral containment and clearance further exploration to clarify whether t cell aicd is antigen-induced andor increased by macrophage-derived cytokines such as il-6 will be importanttrials to block il-6 signalling have been launched across the world and some clinical benefits have been seen in a subset of patients a study from china reported a clear benefit in 15 of 20 75 patients treated with il-6 blockade leading to fda approval of il-6 blockade in patients with covid-19 ref21 a more recent study from italy reported a benefit in only 7 of 21 33 patients22 neither of these studies had control arms and very few data are available on the exact clinical and inflammatory status of patients who responded versus those who did not several groups across the world have now initiated clinical trials combining il-6 receptor and il-1 blockade in patients with covid-19 hopefully careful immune monitoring of responders and non-responders will reveal immune correlates of response or resistance to cytokine blockade and shed light on the pathophysiology of the covid-19-associated inflammatory response measuring the prevalence and severity of disease seen in patients with covid-19 who are on immunomodulatory biologics for other comorbidities will also help us to understand whether blockade of particular immune pathways can modulate covid-19 disease outcomes examples include patients on anti-tnf anti-il-4 receptor anti-il-1223 anti-il-17a and janus kinase jak inhibitors as well as those receiving drugs that interfere with leukocyte migration for example 41 integrin 47 integrin and s1pr inhibitors and t cell co-stimulation these patients will provide important additional insights on the disease pathophysiology of covid-19bronchoalveolar fluid balf from patients with severe covid-19 was shown to be enriched in ccl2 and ccl7 two chemokines that are most potent at the recruitment of cc-chemokine receptor 2-positive ccr2 monocytes23 accordingly single-cell rna sequencing scrna-seq analysis of balf collected from patients with severe or mild covid-19 revealed increased proportions of mnps with these cells accounting for as much as 80 of total balf cells in patients with severe covid-19 compared with only approximately 60 and 40 respectively of total balf cells in patients with mild disease or healthy controls24 mnp composition was further characterized by a depletion of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and an abundance of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in patients with severe disease24 inflammatory programmes seen in these macrophages24 were consistent with findings from bulk rna-seq analysis of balf23 from patients with severe covid-19 and notably both studies identified a strong interferon gene signature in addition a subset of macrophages has been described in patients with covid-19 that is enriched in genes associated with tissue repair and promotes fibrosis generation such as is seen in liver cirrhosis25 this suggests that the pathogenicity of infiltrating macrophages could extend beyond the promotion of acute inflammation and is also in line with the fibrotic complications observed in patients under mechanical ventilation26interestingly clonal expansion of subsets of cd8 t cells with a tissue-resident memory t cell gene signature was observed in the balf of patients with mild covid-19 in which inflammatory monocyte infiltration was minimal these results could suggest that pre-existing populations of tissue-resident memory t cells with potential cross-reactivity against sars-cov-2 enable rapid control of the virus and protect against disease progression by limiting epithelial damage local inflammation and accumulation of pathological macrophage populations while this hypothesis remains to be addressed epidemiological studies have reported that prior bacillus calmettegurin vaccination may protect from covid-19 leading several countries to launch clinical trials testing the protective benefit of intracutaneous administration of bacillus calmettegurin vaccine in health-care workers clincialtrialsgov identifiers nct04328441 and nct04327206a significant expansion of populations of cd14cd16 monocytes producing il-6 was also observed in the peripheral blood of patients with covid-19 in icus compared with those patients who did not require icu hospitalization2728 a finding also supported by scrna-seq analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells29 and our personal observations jcm and r josien unpublished observationsin addition immunostaining of post-mortem tissue from patients who had died from covid-19 revealed that populations of cd169 lymph node subcapsular and splenic marginal zone macrophages express the sars-cov-2 entry receptor ace2 and that these macrophages contained sars-cov-2 nucleoprotein np10 this finding is surprising given that scrna-seq analysis of human tissues failed to identify ace2 expression on most tissue-resident macrophages including on secondary lymphoid tissue-resident macrophages mm e kenigsberg and a leader unpublished observations however it is possible that ace2 expression on macrophages can be triggered by inflammatory signals such as type i interferon30 it is also possible that additional receptors such as cd147 ref31 are involved in virus entry although sars-cov-2 np was detected in secondary lymphoid tissue macrophages10 it is still unclear whether the virus productively infected these cells or whether the np positivity reflected macrophage uptake of other infected cells macrophages that contained sars-cov-2 viral particles were found to express il-6 and the presence of il-6 macrophages was associated with severe depletion of lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes7 cd68np macrophages were also observed in the kidneys of patients with covid-19 and acute kidney tubular damage was associated with marked accumulation of monocytes and macrophages8 these preliminary findings in patients with covid-19 are in line with the pathology observed in post-mortem tissues obtained from patients infected with sars-cov the disease pathology seen in these patients is also characterized by damage to the lungs consistent with ards focal necrosis and lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration into the lungs heart kidney liver and muscles as well as massive necrosis of the spleen and focal necrosis of lymph nodes32the exact drivers of monocyte and macrophage activation in covid-19 and the contribution to covid-19 disease pathophysiology remain to be clarified key questions to address include one the exact contribution of direct viral sensing as opposed to cytokine exposure to macrophage activation two the influence of prior infections and epigenetic remodelling events in shaping monocyte responsiveness33 three the contribution of the tissue site of immune activation that is the inflamed tissue blood or bone marrow to macrophage activation state and four the contribution of tissue-resident macrophages as opposed to monocyte-derived macrophages to tissue damagea similar disease course to that seen during sars-cov-2 infection has been described during infection with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov with 20 of patients ultimately progressing to fatal ards extensive cellular infiltration dominated by macrophages was found in post-mortem lungs from these patients similar to what has been reported in sars-cov-2 high levels of interferon- ifn il-6 il-12 transforming growth factor- tgf ccl2 cxcl10 cxcl9 and il-8 were reported in patients with sars-cov however in contrast to patients infected with sars-cov-2 low levels of il-10 and high levels of il-1 were often detected in sars-cov of note while infection of mnps is abortive in sars-cov mers-cov can replicate in monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells4 as mentioned above sars-cov-2 viral particles were detected in mnps but evidence of productive infection remains to be demonstratedthe factors that drive severe lung pathology during infection with highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are poorly understood potential mechanisms include high rates of viral replication which could be responsible for enhanced host cell cytolysis and the strong production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by infected epithelial cells delayed induction of antiviral interferon responses owing to virus escape mechanisms such as production of interferon inhibitory proteins which perpetuates virual damage leading to excessive accumulation of monocytes macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs4 or modulation of the ace2-mediated epithelial protective pathway upon virus binding to its receptor34 although viruses have evolved many mechanisms to block type i interferon production in infected cells35 it is surprising that reduced interferon activity can persist in patients with covid-19 who show massive inflammatory responses7 this suggests that additional pathways such as inflammasome activation could contribute to the persistent low level of type i interferon induction as was recently shown36 identifying the exact mechanisms that contribute to reduced type i interferon activity will be critical for the development of targeted immunomodulatory strategies in patients with covid-19studies in animal models of virus-induced acute lung injury ali suggest that several pathways drive pro-inflammatory programmes including the infiltration of monocytes for example sustained activation of infiltrating monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages could be driven by type i interferon37 oxidative stress3839 anti-spike protein igg immune complexes40 and nlrp3 inflammasome activation4142 interestingly however deletion of the toll-like receptor tlril-1 receptor adaptor myd88 had no effect on mouse ali38 in fact a protective role of myd88 was even reported although protection was independent of il-1 receptor engagement by il-143 these experiments were conducted in mice with constitutive myd88 deficiency and do not rule out a pathological function for myd88-dependent tlr and il-1-mediated signalling in late stages of the disease however the temporal contribution of inflammasome-induced il-1 to viral clearance andor covid-19 severity remains to be investigatedit remains to be clarified whether similar pathways are involved in sars-cov-2-mediated activation of inflammatory macrophage responses the extent of their contribution to disease severity and the therapeutic benefits of targeting the myd88 tlr andor il-1 pathways it has also yet to be determined whether additional receptors trigger the direct or indirect activation of macrophages by sars-cov-2 and what the contribution of these putative receptors may be to covid-19 disease stages and progression to severe forms of disease figure 1 considers potential pathways that may drive hyperactivation of macrophages during infection with sars-cov-2importantly lower platelets counts increased levels of fibrin degradation products known as d-dimers44 and coagulation abnormalities are being increasingly associated with poor prognosis and could represent a main cause of organ failure and death in patients with severe covid-19 ref45 fig 2 microthrombi of the lungs lower limbs hands brain46 heart liver and kidneys47 have been described in patients with covid-19 notably activation of coagulation and intravascular coagulation is a hallmark of organ injury in sepsis where it is mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines48the initiation of inflammation-induced coagulation leading to an increased coagulation state is almost always mediated by the expression of the tissue factor tf also called cd142 or coagulation factor iii pathway4950 tf is expressed on mononuclear cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines mainly il-6 but tf is also expressed on vascular endothelial cells and is known to promote the transformation of prothrombin into thrombin which in turn converts circulating fibrinogen into fibrin leading to fibrin-based blood clots51 in addition major natural anticoagulant pathways such as antithrombin or tf pathway inhibitor are almost always impaired during inflammation contributing further to the propagation of coagulation in the absence of vascular injury the initiation of coagulation is completely dependent on the recruitment of tf-expressing inflammatory monocytes by activated endothelial cells52 fig 2 it is also possible that oxidized phospholipids oxpls  which have been detected in the lungs of patients infected with sars-cov38  contribute to the process53 oxpls are produced following oxidative stress they promote the induction of tf expression and inflammatory programmes in monocytes and activate endothelial cells to recruit and bind to monocytes5354 in experimental ali oxpls trigger macrophage activation through the tlr4triftraf6nf-b pathway38 interfering with monocyte andor endothelial cell activation in response to oxpls could help prevent thrombotic complications especially in patients with covid-19 who have pre-existing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities13 however it is important to note that the sars-cov-2 entry receptor ace2 is expressed on arterial and venous endothelial cells5556 where it plays an anti-inflammatory protective effect whether the increased coagulopathy observed in patients with covid-19 is also partly due to direct vascular damage induced by sars-cov-2 infection or ace2 inhibition remains to be determinedclinical trials to assess the benefits of inflammatory cytokine blockade targeting il-6 and il-1 alone or in combination are in progress table 1 trials examining the blockade of additional myeloid-derived inflammatory cytokines such as tnf57 and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gmcsf nct04341116 have also been considered andor initiated strategies aimed at broadly interfering with cytokine signalling could also significantly reduce hyperinflammation in patients with severe covid-19 and several trials testing the use of jak inhibitors are ongoing alternatively strategies upstream of the production of individual cytokines could represent a broader and possibly more effective way to dampen the occurrence of cytokine release syndromes current evidence suggests that pathological macrophages mostly derive from circulating monocytes that massively infiltrate the lungs and other organs rather than from tissue-resident macrophage populations circulating cd14 monocytes require the chemokine receptor ccr2 to exit the bone marrow and to accumulate in inflamed tissues5859 ccr2 blockade could potentially help to reduce the accumulation of pathological monocytes in inflamed tissues although it is likely that redundant mechanisms independent of ccr2 may also contribute to monocyte accumulation in tissues during severe inflammation trials targeting ccr5 another chemokine receptor that regulates monocyte and t cell migration have been initiated in patients with covid-19 who show mild-to-moderate symptoms of respiratory illness nct04343651 although the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine remains uncertain its immunomodulatory activity in chronic inflammatory diseases is well established60 and this could have contributed to the reported although still controversial clinical benefits of this drug in patients with covid-19based on evidence that interferon responses to coronaviruses deviate from those induced by other respiratory viruses3761 trials testing the administration of type i or type iii interferons have been initiated type i interferon ifn receptors are ubiquitously expressed and type i interferons can drive antiviral effects but also induce the activation of immune cells that could potentially enhance tissue pathology by contrast type iii interferon also known as ifn mainly targets epithelial cells as well as a restricted pool of immune cells and could therefore promote a potent antiviral effect without enhancing pathological tissue inflammation62 as discussed above inflammatory macrophages from the lungs of patients with severe covid-19 exhibit a strong interferon signature and it is possible that while interferon may be protective during the early stages of the disease persistent ifn production could ultimately drive macrophage hyperactivation as is seen in macrophage activation syndrome trials exploring ifn blockade in patients with covid-19 who show respiratory distress and hyperinflammation have been initiated nct04324021current models of covid-19 propose three distinct immune stages that are crucial for the ultimate disease course in the first stage early activation of the immune system through the induction of a potent interferon response is important to control the virus in the second stage a delayed interferon response may lead to progressive tissue damage this may ultimately lead to the third stage a deleterious hyperinflammation characterized by the excessive macrophage activation and coagulation that is seen in patients with severe disease possibly followed by dysregulation of tissue repair mechanisms and fibrosis63 the exact drivers of pathological inflammation in covid-19 remain to be identified but it is crucial that we establish the pathways involved in the different stages of the inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 and determine the contribution of these pathways to ultimate disease outcome the results of these studies should help identify not only the most relevant immunomodulatory strategies but also the optimal timing of such immunomodulatory interventions to maximize therapeutic effectalthough data characterizing the immune and inflammatory status in patients with covid-19 are only starting to emerge it is clear that hyperinflammation and coagulopathy contribute to disease severity and death in patients infected with sars-cov-2 a better understanding of which subsets of patients are at risk of pathological inflammation and which particular inflammatory pathways drive disease pathology is crucial to develop rationale-based clinical therapeutic strategies it is critical to start measuring longitudinally and with as much granularity as possible the systemic and potentially local inflammatory responses induced by sars-cov-2 and how these pathways are modulated by the different therapies currently used as standard of care or in clinical trials although it is difficult to engage in research in the middle of a pandemic clinical centres that have the means to perform deep-monitoring studies now have the responsibility to conduct such studies and to share their strategies and results with the scientific communitysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the third zoonotic coronavirus to cross the species barrier infect humans and become transmitted between humans1 whereas the two other zoonotic coronaviruses sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov could be contained at the regional level sars-cov-2 has led to a global pandemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 although covid-19 usually presents as a mild respiratory disease like infections caused by the four endemic human coronavirus hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 it can occasionally lead to severe alveolar inflammation in a large study from china 15 of sars-cov-2-infected patients developed shortness of breath radiological infiltrates in the lung and a drop in blood oxygen saturation 93 and 5 had critical illness requiring ventilation2 although such data might slightly overestimate the frequency of severe lung involvement because testing for sars-cov-2 infection is not performed in milder cases and is therefore underestimated covid-19 undoubtedly constitutes a substantial risk factor for pulmonary failure histopathological findings of the lungs of deceased patients with covid-19 showed extensive alveolar damage fibrin deposits widespread infiltration with immune cells and thrombosis of small and large pulmonary vessels3 even though the clinical picture of severe covid-19 resembles that of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards these lung histopathological findings suggest that covid-19 creates a specific form of alveolar disease that is different from other forms of ards the risk of severe lung disease in the context of covid-19 depends on certain as yet to be determined susceptibility factors of the host higher age is one of the known risk factors and as with the other zoonotic coronaviruses the clinical course of covid-19 is more severe in older individuals whereas children and adolescents who typically develop flu-like symptoms owing to the four endemic coronaviruses are virtually spared from sars and mers4 reports suggest however that in very rare cases kawasaki-like disease can occur as a complication of covid-19 ref5the current covid-19 pandemic raises several interesting research questions as well as clinical challenges in the context of rheumatic diseases in this perspective article we address some of these points we first consider the musculoskeletal symptoms elicited by covid-19 we then describe how the mechanisms of alveolar inflammation in covid-19 share similarities with those in rheumatoid arthritis ra in particular with respect to the pattern of cytokines involved in driving the inflammatory process on the basis of this concept we discuss the potential of currently existing cytokine-blocking strategies to treat covid-19 as well as their respective impact on the risk of developing viral infection finally we critically discuss the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseasesmusculoskeletal symptoms can develop during coronavirus infections as with other respiratory infections in general viral infections can cause arthritis but the spectrum of symptoms is wide ranging from arthralgia to spurious and chronic arthritis6 fig 1 whereas chronic arthritis can be caused by hepatitis c and several endemic alphaviruses such as chikungunya ross river barmah forest sindbis onyong-nyong and mayaro viruses self-limited arthritis occurs with parvovirus b19 rubella or hepatitis b virus6 by contrast coronaviruses do not typically cause clinical arthritis but rather arthralgia and myalgia711 joint and muscle pain are quite rare occurring in 10 of cases in the endemic coronaviruses whereas arthralgia is reported in 15 of patients with covid-19 and myalgia is even more frequent 4478 musculoskeletal symptoms however do not seem to be associated with covid-19 severity8 myalgia is also common in sars-cov and is found in 4968 of cases910 but arthralgia is less frequent 11 arthralgia and myalgia are also common in patients with mers-cov 3211 however it needs to be considered that these prevalence data are based on the background of high doses of glucocorticoids cumulative doses of 1 g glucocorticoids do not seem to be of benefit in sars or mers1214 but they probably dampen the musculoskeletal manifestations of covid-19 overall covid-19 seems to present with or be complicated by mild-to-modest musculoskeletal symptoms which are indistinguishable from those associated with other respiratory viruses such as influenza infection finally another interesting aspect in the relationship between coronaviruses and arthritis is that the endemic human coronaviruses are associated with an increased risk of developing ra in a large korean study the authors observed that infections with endemic human coronavirus parainfluenza virus and metapneumovirus coincided with an increased rate of development of ra15 thus the covid-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an increase in cases of ra however to date there is no report to indicate that people develop autoimmune inflammatory arthritis such as ra after being infected by sars-cov-2 or any of the other six known human coronavirusesalthough some data suggest that immune cells such as macrophages can be infected by sars viruses the primary target of these viruses is epithelial cells infection is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a carboxypeptidase that binds to the spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 ace2 is expressed by the epithelium of the mouth tongue and upper airways thus enabling endocytosis of the virus16 in most patients unknown host factors confine the infection to these structures leading to flu-like symptoms ace2 can be shed from epithelial cells by the activity of the metalloproteinase adam17 ref17 which enables ace2 to act as a decoy receptor for sars-cov-2 potentially preventing viral spreading the most critical step in sars and mers invasion is the infection of alveolar type 2 at2 cells which also express ace2 this process can lead to the acute alveolar damage common to all zoonotic coronaviruses18 at2 cells are important for alveolar regeneration after damage in which setting their proliferation depends on il-1 and tnf expressed by resident macrophages and other immune cells19in some patients with sars or mers this inflammatory alveolar niche gets out of control fig 2 age is by far the most relevant risk factor for severe covid-19 it is well known that cytokine responses such as il-6 responses are increased in advanced age20 at the alveolar level transcriptional profiling of at2 cells from the lungs of aged mice has shown that these cells have increased transcriptional instability which leads to disrupted cell function and more widespread responses21 this process might enable the triggering of excessive or uncontrolled cytokine responses also referred to as a cytokine storm in the lungs of patients infected with sars or mers in support of this concept circulating serum concentrations of most pro-inflammatory effector cytokines such as tnf il-1 il-6 il-8 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf as well as chemokines such as ccl2 also known as mcp1 cxcl10 also known as ip-10 and ccl3 also known as mip1 are elevated in patients with covid-19 resembling over-activation of innate immunity22 this cytokine activation profile illustrates the accumulation of an armada of neutrophils and bone-marrow-derived macrophages in the damaged alveolar structuresthe hierarchical order of cytokines involved in covid-19 is not yet known but mediators that are currently therapeutically targeted in ra and in autoinflammatory syndromes seem to be of central importance23 initially epithelial cells infected by sars viruses act as a cytokine source releasing il-6 and il-1 as well as il-8 and several other chemokines that can activate macrophages attract neutrophils and orchestrate homing of monocytes and macrophages to inflammatory sites24 for instance the nucleocapsid protein of sars viruses can activate il-6 expression through the transcription factor nf-b25 after mounting the initial inflammatory response to alveolar damage monocytes and macrophages seem to contribute to cytokine production hence sars-cov stimulates macrophages to increase their production of certain chemokines for example mip1 as well as il-6 and tnf26 this effect further augments the infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages in the alveoli further contributing to tissue destructioninfection with sars viruses is associated with peripheral lymphocytopenia which in the case of covid-19 is present in 80 of patients at the time of hospital admission and affects predominantly cd4 t cells including effector memory t cells and regulatory t cells22 the pathogenesis of covid-19-associated lymphocytopenia is unknown but it is thought that lymphocytes redistribute to the lungs lessons from previous outbreaks of sars-cov and mers-cov infections in fact suggest that these viruses induce robust il-17 production by lymphocytes and that il-17 boosts the pro-inflammatory nature of the host anti-viral immune response to sars viruses2728 in accordance with this mechanism concentrations of not only il-17 but also gm-csf another important pro-inflammatory mediator expressed by t helper 17 th17 cells are high in patients with covid-19 refs2223 as il-17 is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory sites it is likely that this cytokine  which alongside tnf is an important therapeutic target in spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis  might contribute to the development of covid-19 notably il-17 is not the only t cell-derived effector cytokine that is elevated in covid-19 and might contribute to lung inflammation concentrations of il-4 il-9 and il-13 which are associated with type 2 immunity bronchial hypersensitivity and increased mucus production are also high in patients with covid-19 ref22 these mediators reflect activation of th2 cells th9 cells eosinophils and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in the lungs of patients with covid-19 although these mediators might have a pro-inflammatory function in the lungs in covid-19 several previous studies have shown that they act differently in the joints and contribute to resolution of arthritis2930sars-cov-2 like sars-cov and mers-cov has the capability to trigger a massive immune response associated with a cytokine storm leading to ards which can be lethal in the most serious cases of covid-19 refs233132 hence anti-cytokine intervention which does not increase the risk of viral infection and thus might not affect viral clearance but would inhibit the hyper-inflammatory state in covid-19 might be beneficial33 by contrast broad immunosuppression especially by targeting lymphocyte function for example with glucocorticoid therapy could be harmful in covid-19 which itself is associated with substantial lymphocytopenia indeed none of the current data on sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov supports the use of glucocorticoids1214 thus the use of anti-cytokine agents in the most critical phases of covid-19 is supported by a rationale that overcomes potential concerns about dampening the host response to the virus which pro-inflammatory cytokine is most critical to the pathogenesis of covid-19 is currently unknown although il-6 seems to be pivotal3435 indeed the results of a chinese study36 exploring the use of the il-6 receptor il-6r antagonist tocilizumab are encouraging and several trials with il-6r antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab and il-6 inhibitors sirukumab have now been initiated3738 il-1 inhibition also seems to make sense in the treatment of covid-19 as il-1 is produced by at2 cells upon infection with sars-cov24 and is an important effector cytokine of innate immunity controlling neutrophil and macrophage function indeed il-1 inhibition with high-dose anakinra or with canakinumab is currently being evaluated as treatment for covid-19 refs3940 tnf has been proposed as a target for the treatment of sars-cov41 and more recently for sars-cov-2 infection42 preclinical data suggest that tnf inhibition mitigates viral pneumonia43 and clinical data indicate that patients being treated with tnf inhibitors for inflammatory diseases do not have a worse outcome of covid-19 than those treated with conventional drugs44 currently a study evaluating the tnf inhibitor adalimumab in covid-19 has been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry chictr200003008945beyond the drugs capable of selectively blocking cytokines much attention has been paid to drugs that modulate the production of more than one cytokine such as janus kinase jak inhibitors as mentioned above sars-cov-2 enters target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis13 some of the identified regulators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are members of the numb-associated kinase family such as ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 and cyclin g-associated kinase gak inhibition of aak1 might prevent the virus from entering lung cells46 and the jak inhibitor baricitinib is able to effectively inhibit aak1 and gak47 moreover as an inhibitor of jak1 and jak2 baricitinib inhibits il-6 and gm-csf concentrations of which are elevated in covid-19 ref22 at least five studies with baricitinib one with tofacitinib and one with ruxolitinib are ongoing48gm-csf is a key mediator for macrophage and neutrophil attraction from the bone marrow to inflamed tissues and is a validated target for the treatment of ra gm-csf thereby represents a link between t cell activation and innate immune effector cells as th17 cells are a major source of gm-csf49 as gm-csf levels are high in covid-19 ref22 studies have been initiated of neutralizing antibodies that block gm-csf in covid-19 ref50although most of the cytokines induced in covid-19 as well as those being targeted in ra and other forms of inflammatory arthritis are important in mounting an inflammatory response they might not be essential for controlling virus clearance in support of this concept therapeutic neutralization of tnf il-6 and il-1 yields a moderate increase in bacterial but not viral infection notably although the incidence of influenza and the risk of developing complications from influenza infection is 275-fold higher in patients with ra than in individuals without ra no signal related to cytokine inhibitor treatment has been observed51 in addition patients with ra undergoing treatment with tnf inhibitors achieve a normal immune response to influenza vaccination further supporting the concept that effector cytokines induced by sars-cov-2 and in ra are critical for inflammatory responses but not for viral clearance as a matter of fact data from patients with ra and those with inflammatory bowel disease treated with tnf inhibitors seem to be reassuring with no increase in the risk of covid-19 refs445253 however further data on the adverse or potentially even beneficial effects of cytokine inhibitors in respiratory infections need to be collected as preclinical data for example on il-6 have also suggested that cytokines not only have an important role in the inflammatory response against viruses but are also required to mount a proper immune response against the virus54in contrast to compounds directed against single pro-inflammatory cytokines the use of jak inhibitors might raise some concern in principle with respect to viral clearance type i interferons are among the most powerful molecules for preventing viral replication these molecules exert their action via jakstat signalling which activates interferon-stimulated genes to enable elimination of virus-infected cells many viruses have developed strategies to counteract the effects of type i interferons some of which antagonize the jakstat pathway55 consequently jak blockade most likely impairs interferon-mediated anti-viral responses which could promote rather than inhibit sars-cov-2 infection this mechanism explains the increased risk of varicella zoster and herpes simplex virus infection reported in patients treated with jak inhibitors56 notably viral infections including herpes zoster and herpes simplex can account for up to 10 of community-acquired and up to 50 of ventilator-associated pneumonia cases57 moreover lymphocytopenia seems to be a negative prognostic factor in severely affected patients with covid-19 ref58 and jak-inhibitor-induced leukopenia is a well-known adverse event therefore while awaiting results from ongoing studies a word of caution is warranted before suggesting jak inhibition in this setting5960beyond studies aimed at identifying an effective treatment for covid-19 the availability of a specific vaccine for sars-cov-2 will certainly offer a possible definitive exit from the pandemic as of 8 april 2020 the global covid-19 vaccine research and development landscape included 115 vaccine candidates of which 78 are being actively pursued at the moment61 in general it should be emphasized that despite many discussions about the safety and efficacy of vaccination in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy data from large cohorts indicate that vaccines might be safer and more effective in this setting than previously thought62the covid-19 pandemic is having a profound effect on rheumatology practice on the one hand a large part of the usual activity of rheumatology units has been absorbed by the growing need to manage patients with covid-19 on the other hand the need to maintain the high standard of care required for the treatment of rheumatic diseases remains63 the reduction in the number of physicians available in rheumatology owing to absence because of disease quarantine or involvement in the covid units is difficult to reconcile with the treat-to-target approach that has now become the core of the treatment of all chronic inflammatory diseases in addition ensuring the proper evaluation of patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs and the timely management of disease flares becomes increasingly challenging in this context rheumatologists should reorganize their work by trying to postpone all non-urgent visits and weighing the potential harm of delaying an in-person visit against the potential harm of covid-19 infection we are learning how to make a virtue of necessity by unlocking a new era in patient management indeed the covid-19 pandemic has suddenly disrupted the traditional model of health care both for patients with rheumatic diseases and for rheumatologists accelerating the transition to remote health care64finally the widespread use of anti-rheumatic drugs in patients with covid-19 in areas affected by the pandemic in a fast and sometimes irrationally growing market could endanger supplies of these drugs for patients with rheumatic diseases65 this challenge is already being faced in europe and the usa regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and tocilizumab66 regulators and manufacturers will have to keep this problem in mind to avoid unexpected and regrettable disease recurrence in patients with rheumatic disease owing to suspension of treatmentthe pattern of pro-inflammatory effector cytokines in the alveolar membranes during severe covid-19 shares similarities with the primary cytokines targeted in the treatment of ra table 1 both diseases lead to profound inflammation of structures that form the inner surfaces of the body and induce tissue destruction and responses that lead to organ failure covid-19 is characterized by an excessive or uncontrolled host immune response elicited by alveolar epithelial cell damage and t cell activation in the lungs that triggers exaggerated local production of pro-inflammatory effector cytokines and leads to the attraction of large numbers of neutrophils and macrophages to the lungs barrier damage t cell activation effector cytokine production and neutrophil influx are also key features of synovitis and some of the mediators are shared between covid-19 and ra the bulk of inflammation and structural damage in covid-19 is limited to the lungs which are progressively destroyed furthermore and most likely owing to robust il-6 activation covid-19 leads to systemic acute-phase responses which are shared with ra whether cytokine inhibition can block this process remains to be determined but a rationale exists for this approach surprisingly the original widespread concerns about using cytokine inhibitors in a potentially life-threating infectious disease such as covid-19 have been balanced by the recognition that a pathological hyper-inflammatory state is driving the pathology and might require therapeutic cytokine inhibition these concepts will also affect our advice to patients with arthritis about whether to stop or continue anti-rheumatic therapy given that most of these treatments do not increase the risk of viral pneumonia that glucocorticoids which are often used to treat flares are potentially deleterious in covid-19 and that preliminary data from high-risk areas do not suggest an increased risk of covid-19 in patients with arthritis anti-rheumatic therapy should be continued during the pandemic and not be pre-emptively stoppedsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a member of the genus betacoronavirus within the family coronaviridae it is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus 1 in december of 2019 the first cases of an atypical viral pneumonia were reported in wuhan china since that time a global expansion of the infection has occurred with widespread dissemination of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2 3 for most the infection is mild with low-grade fever and cough but 15 are associated with respiratory compromise severe cases result in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with systemic inflammation in which lung injury is associated with release of inflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-1 2 4 the systemic inflammatory syndrome is characterized by dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine cascades triggered by an intense rapid activation of the innate immune response covid-19 severity is associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and il-6 specifically is predictive of covid-19 fatality 5 high levels of interleukin il-1 and il-6 were detected in autopsy tissues from sars-cov patients 6 and single cell rna-seq analysis of peripheral blood in covid-19 patients show increased subsets of cd14 il-1-producing monocytes 7 a clear mechanism is not yet understood the inflammatory basis underlying covid-19 fatality renders development of immunoregulatory agents of paramount importance 8 there is significant literature implicating the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 nlrp3 inflammasome and cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm in this pathogenesis 912 the nlrp3 inflammasome is an important cause of activation of the innate immune system to recognize pathogens including viral infections 13 14 sars-cov 3a protein activates the nlrp3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages with 3a-mediated il-1 secretion associated with k efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species 15individuals at risk for this inflammatory syndrome include those with hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease respiratory disease and cancer 16 17 it is not clear why individuals at risk include those with cardiovascular risk factors but may relate to the virology of sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov uses the spike glycoprotein s protein on the surface of the virion to mediate viral membrane fusion 18 the s protein is a trimer that is cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits s1 binds directly to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 19 to expose s2 to cleavage that enables fusion and entry 20 the physiological function of ace2 in the cell is the maturation of angiotensin ang which regulates blood pressure through vasoconstriction clinical literature based on the 2003 sars-cov epidemic suggested that the virus caused ace2 downregulation and that lung injury may be improved by angiotensive ii receptor blocker arb treatment 21 22 further literature implicates ace2 signaling in nlrp3 activation in multiple settings angii can induce nlrp3 inflammasome activation in renal tubular epithelial cells 23 angii induces pulmonary fibrosis which is attenuated by ace2 24 and nlrp3 inflammasome activation drives ang ii-induced vascular smooth muscle cell vsmc proliferation and vascular remodeling and hypertension 25 26individuals infected with sars-cov-2 can present with an array of clinical severity from asymptomatic through severe disease characterized by pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs shock and multiorgan dysfunction coagulopathy and death 27 early symptoms can include shortness of breath fever and cough with increasing reports of loss of taste and smell 4 17 2830 individuals demonstrated to be at high risk of severe outcomes include those with advanced age hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus 4 29 31 32 severe covid-19 is associated with increased serum inflammatory cytokine levels including il-1 il-6 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon- inducible protein 10 ip-10 and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- 5 17 3336overwhelming inflammatory cytokine secretion can result in ards through massive recruitment of immune cells leading to vascular leakage fluid accumulation causing pulmonary edema and resulting hypoxemia 3739 reports of patients with severe covid-19 indicate that elevated levels of il-1 and il-6 are associated with elevated immune exhaustion and reduced t cell functional diversity 40 by contrast individuals with covid-19 who experience more mild disease have lower levels of il-6 together with activated t lymphocytes and igm sars-cov-2-binding antibodies 41 these observations indicate that a robust inflammatory cytokine response mediates severe disease while low inflammatory cytokine responses may be associated with an adaptive response that favors disease resolution il-1 is a key regulator of many chronic inflammatory diseases 4249 therefore probing the role of il-1 and its inhibition might lead to reduced inflammatory signaling thus reducing lung injury in ards associated with severe covid-19the nlrp3 nod- lrr- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammasome consists of a sensor nlrp3 an adaptor asc also known as pycard and an effector caspase 1 50 nlrp3 contains an amino-terminal pyrin domain pyd a central nacht domain domain present in naip ciita het-e and tp1 and a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain lrr domain the nacht domain mediates atpase function that is vital for nlrp3 self-association and function 51 and the lrr domains autoregulate through folding back onto the nacht domain asc has two protein binding domains an amino-terminal pyd and a carboxy-terminal caspase recruitment domain card nlrp3 can oligomerize between nacht domains upon stimulation which leads to asc recruitment through pydpyd interactions the formation of multiple asc filaments is referred to as an asc speck 5254 the assembled asc complex can recruit caspase 1 to facilitate cleavage and activationactivation of the inflammasome is highly regulated and mediated by a two-step process in which first priming occurs and then activation occurs priming allows for transcription upregulation of the nlrp3 genes in response to recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps such as lipopolysaccharides and viral rna or damage-associated molecular patterns damps such as atp and reactive oxygen species through purine sensing receptors including p2rx7 13 14 5456 engagement of pamps andor damps can activate pattern recognition receptors prrs such as toll-like receptors tlrs or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 nod2 this leads to activation of nuclear factor-b nf-b activation and gene transcription 57 priming also shifts oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in macrophages resulting in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 hif1 and increase in il1b gene transcription 58 priming additionally induces post-translational modifications of the nlrp3 inflammasome which include ubiquitylation phosphorylation and sumoylation that stabilize the nlrp3 inflammasome in an auto-suppressed inactive signal-competent state 59after priming nlrp3 inflammasome activation can occur in response to an array of pathogens or endogenous damps multiple cellular signaling events can result in nlrp3 activation at the membrane including efflux of potassium k or chloride ions cl and flux of calcium ions ca2 6070 as well as other cellular functions including lysosomal disruption mitochondrial dysfunction metabolic changes and trans-golgi disassembly 50nlrp3 activation can lead to pyroptosis an inflammatory programmed cell death pathway that takes place in t lymphocytes 71 this inflammatory cell death is activated through gasdermin d gsdmd cleavage by caspase 1 4 5 andor 11 and results in a series of cellular events including swelling of the cytoplasm plasma membrane rupture and consolidation of the nucleus with release of cytoplasmic contents into the extracellular space 72 73 gsdmd contains an amino-terminal cell death domain gsdmdnterm which is exposed through caspase cleavage to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates and phosphatidylserine in the cell membrane inserting into the plasma membrane and forming a pore that kills the cell from within 74 75 additionally gsdmd can mediate il-1 and il-18 secretion 76 77 and this occurs both through pathways dependent and independent of nlrp3 signalingcell death is an important cause of pathogenesis in viral infections hiv-1 infection is associated with programmed cell death through pyroptosis in bystander cells 7882 and represents an important mechanism of nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated immune cell depletion programmed cell death through multiple mechanisms has been reported in coronavirus infections as an important mechanism of viral pathogenesis 8388there are numerous studies that implicate the nlrp3 inflammasome and il-1 in mediating inflammation during lung injury and ards 39 89 90 bronchoalveolar fluid and plasma in patients with ards have elevated il-1 levels compared to healthy controls 9194 and is associated with worse clinical outcomes in other coronavirus infections including mers-cov and sars-cov patients with ards had high levels of il-1 il-6 and il-8 6 9597 in other respiratory viral infections such as influenza high levels of il-1 have been detected in bronchoalveolar fluid and plasma from patients with lung injury 9194 98101 furthermore animal studies in which mice deficient in components of the inflammasome have reduced lung injury and enhanced survival with influenza infection 45 102 in pharmacologic studies in which il-1 or il-1r was antagonized influenza associated lung injury was reduced 103 104 taken together il-1 appears to play a key role in acute lung injury with respiratory viral infections and pharmacologic targeting of this pathway represents an important area of interventioninjury of type ii alveolar epithelial cells expressing ace2 leads to nlrp3 inflammasome activation 14 15 105 the acute immune response to sars-cov-2 infection is largely driven by inflammatory alveolar and monocyte-derived macrophages that are activated by pamps and damps released by infected apoptotic pneumocytes 11 106108 tnf- and il-1 secreted by alveolar macrophages initiate the acute proinflammatory cascade immediately following infection the secretion of these cytokines induces cell death and damage pampdamp production immune cell recruitment and widespread nlrp3 activation establishing a proinflammatory positive feedback cascade 11 106 108110 more recently blanco-melo et al demonstrated that sars-cov-2 infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines including tnf- il-6 and il-1 111this localized inflammatory cell death extends to the vasculature inducing the leakage edema and pneumonia characteristic of covid-19 11 108 109 it is important to note that the onset of this pathological immune response is characterized not by systemic inflammation but by a hyperinflammatory microenvironment localized to the site of tissue injury as the inflammatory cascade progresses il-1 and tnf- induce the secretion of additional nlrp3 cytokines such as il-6 which can subsequently be observed in the peripheral blood due to the loss of vascular integrity 11 107110 112 113 the kinetics of the inflammatory response are essential to effective clinical practicecirculating biomarkers such as il-6 may prove useful to predicting outcomes and informing immunomodulatory treatment decisions 31 33 114116the rapid decline of covid-19 patients coincides with an abrupt shift from the nlrp3 cytokine storm to a compensatory immunosuppressive state 5 107 this repair and recovery-oriented phase is characterized by production of il-10 polarization of macrophages to the anti-inflammatory m2 state suppression of nlrp3 and recruitment of fibroblasts and platelets the accumulation of fibroblasts and m2 macrophages in the lung initiates the deposition of collagen and construction of the extracellular matrices that characterize ards fibrosis 11 108 117 m2 macrophages and other markers of this pro-fibrotic anti-inflammatory environment have been detected in the bronchioalveolar fluid of severe covid-19 patients 117 118unique to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is the downmodulation of the ace2 receptor sars-cov entry has been reported to be dependent on tnf- converting enzyme and coupled to the release of tnf- from the cell membrane 110 tnf- specifically has been shown to act as an alternative toll-like receptor tlr agonist that may increase the sensitivity and longevity of nlrp3 activation 113 119 downregulation of ace2 is associated with both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 disease severity 21 120 121 this contrasts with a minimally symptomatic coronavirus strain hcov-nl63 that utilizes but does not cleave or downmodulate the ace2 receptor 122 the overproduction of tnf- in covid-19 may preferentially activate the nlrp3 inflammasome relative to other immunological pathways these observations warrant further investigation into the mechanisms by and extent to which tnf- acts as a significant modulator of severe covid-19the sars-cov genome encodes 3 ion channel proteins e open reading frame 3a orf3a and orf8a in which e and orf3a are required for both replication and virulence 87 109 123126 in addition to the canonical nlrp3 activation pathway by pamps and damps the e 3a and 8b proteins of sars-cov function as nlrp3 agonists 84 107 109 123 127 many of these sequences are conserved in sars-cov-2 and likely play a role in inflammatory pathogenesis 107 128 the sars-cov e 3a and 8b proteins are all reported to induce nlrp3 activation and il-1 release in lps-primed macrophage models 15 127 a wide variety of mechanisms have been proposed for this nlrp3 agonism including e- 3a- and 8b-induced viroporin activity interferon antagonism membrane-bound organelle stress reactive oxygen species production and direct binding to and regulation of inflammasome components such as caspase 1 nlrp3 and nf-b 15 86 107 109 112 123 127 there are multiple pathways by which sars-cov triggers nlrp3 activation which have yet to be characterized and are likely influenced by cell type and the extracellular microenvironment 15 84 86 88 107notably the nlrp3-implicated orfs 3a and 8 are the primary sites driving genetic diversification of sars-cov-2 orf3a specifically is the only gene undergoing diversifying mutations that are predicted to exhibit altered phenotypes 84 113 127 129 ongoing mutations in orf8 are particularly concerning as a 29-nt deletion of the sars-cov genome is suspected to have increased the pathogenicity of the virus during the sars-cov epidemic by antagonizing interferon increasing viral titers and agonizing nlrp3 127 130 the uniquely low homology between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov orfs 3a and 8 may play a role in the differences in virulence and pathogenesis between these two related viral infections 107 131 defining the inflammatory activities of these two proteins is therefore critical to predictive monitoring and modeling of novel sars-cov-2 strain emergencegenetic variations in host inflammasome pathways may also influence disease outcome mutations in the lrr domain of bat nlrp3 mediate an overall dampened nlrp3 response to agonists 85 in the context of coronavirus infections mers-cov does not induce clinical disease in bats despite high viral titers this appears to be mediated by nlrp3 85 interestingly sars-cov orf8b is reported to activate nlrp3 via direct binding to the lrr domain suggesting a mechanism of coronavirus-induced nlrp3 activation and further indicating therapeutic potential for nlrp3 immunomodulatory agents 127 defining these mechanisms should be a focus of sars-cov-2 research so as to identify targeted therapeutics such as those summarized in table 1cytokine release syndrome crs is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a number of stimuli including drugs and infections 153 154 the term was originally coined in response to administration of anti-t-cell antibody muromonab-cd3 okt3 to solid organ transplant patients who experienced an idiosyncratic cytokine storm following treatment 155 156 a number of other drugs have stimulated similar infusion reactions including antibody-based therapies 157164 and cancer therapeutics 165 166 other reported stimuli for the development of crs include haploidentical donor stem cell transplantation graft-vs-host disease 167 168 and respiratory viral infections including influenza 11 169 most recently new classes of immunotherapeutic agents are used in a variety of hematologic malignancies including bispecific antibody constructs and chimeric antigen receptor car t cell therapiesin response to these stimuli patients experience robust cytokine-mediated response that is associated with fever hypotension and hypoxemia the syndrome can be mild and resolve spontaneously or can progress to persistent high-grade fevers vasodilatory shock with hemodynamic instability severe hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation this can be associated with end-organ damage including liver injury cardiac ischemia clotting dysfunction kidney dysfunction and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosismacrophage activation syndrome hlhmas 154 the timing of onset is unpredictable between 1 day to 2 months after exposure 170in sars-cov-2 infection a cytokine storm occurs that has similar features to crs as described above individuals with severe covid-19 with cytokine storm have elevated systemic inflammatory biomarkers including c-reactive protein d-dimer ferritin 3 115 171173 patients experience a dysfunctional immune response characterized by high levels of plasma cytokines including il-6 tnf- il-8 il-10 il-1ra and cxcl10 4 117 il-6 levels increase over time higher in those who die of the infection compared to those who survive 27 the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines largely through activated macrophages leads to acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs shock and multiorgan dysfunction and coagulopathy 117 this is described in figure 1individuals with severe covid-19 have developed a coagulopathy which is associated with reduced platelet count increased levels of fibrin degradation productions d-dimer and increased microthrombi in lungs brain kidney and extremities 174176 the nlrp3 inflammasome may play a key role in mediating this coagulopathy activated macrophages undergoing nlrp3 inflammasome activation release tissue factor which initiates coagulation 177 178 regulation of platelet integrins 179 180 and through hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha hif-1 181 whether nlrp3 inflammasome activation as a mediator of coagulopathy is an area of great interest for future investigationexperimental therapeutics assessed in vitro and in vivo have provided further insight into the role of nlrp3 in mediating sars-cov pathogenicity in bone marrow-derived macrophages a mitochondrial antioxidant reduced il-1 secretion induced by sars-cov 3a and e proteins 15 in sars-cov-infected mice the nf-b antagonists cape resveratrol bay11-7082 and parthenolide improved survival and reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs 182 depletion of inflammatory macrophages also mitigated sars-cov-associated inflammatory lung pathology in mice without impacting viral load 108 these reports elucidate molecular and clinical inflammatory phenotypes that appear to parallel those seen in covid-19 and should be used to inform novel therapeutic development and pathogenesis studiescross-regulation between type i interferon ifn-i and the nlrp3 inflammasome is implicated in the abrupt proinflammatory response to immunosuppressive switch characteristic of sars and covid-19 ards through an undefined mechanism 5 107 early ifn-i administration may therapeutically regulate nlrp3 and has been shown to abrogate clinical symptomatology in sars-cov-infected macaques 112 and mice 108 dual corticosteroid-ifn-i treatment appeared to improve outcomes in a small-cohort sars-cov trial 183 184 the therapeutic impact observed in mice macaques and humans in each setting occurred despite unchanged viral loads 108 112 183 184both il-6r and il-1 receptor blocking agents have been used for the treatment of crs 185 186 tocilizumab an il-6r blocking antibody has been used to treat severe crs 187 188 in the setting of car-t cell therapy and in the setting of sars-cov-2 infection 5 similarly the il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra improves car-t cell therapy crs outcomes and also significantly increases survival of sars-cov-infected mice with hyperactive nlrp3 inflammasomes 186 189 190 in a retrospective cohort analysis intravenous administration of high-dose anakinra increased survival and clinical improvement in covid-19 patients with ards 191 evidence from car-t-induced crs suggests parallels to the covid-19 inflammatory response that would suggest that targeting il-1 would reduce the inflammatory signaling that mediates lung injury ards and mortality table 1 shows a list of agents in various stages of development that target the nlrp3 inflammasometherapeutics targeting il-1 and the nlrp3 inflammasome pathway have similarly been employed and efficacious in the context of cardiovascular disease the nlrp3 inhibitors arglabin and mcc950 reduced il-1 plasma levels and decreased atherosclerotic lesion size 48 192 il-1 neutralizing antibodies and anakinra showed reduced cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial dysfunction post-mi 193195 the cantos trial randomized patients with past mi and elevated hscrp to receive canakinumab a monoclonal antibody targeting il-1 and found a 15 reduction in major cv events 144in sum covid-19 causes an array of disease manifestations the most severe of which is mediated by a massive inflammatory response that appears to occur through stimulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome direct data linking the nlrp3 inflammasome and sars-cov-2 infection are limited given the recent onset of this new pathogen and its global impact the pathogenesis of this infection and cytokine storm mirrors many of those features observed in cardiovascular disease hiv-1 pathogenesis and sars-cov for this reason it is of value to contextualize what is already known about the nlrp3 as a mediator of inflammatory signaling to inform future studies of pathogenesis and therapeutic development given the urgent need for drug discoverysignificant evidence supports the role of il-1 and nlrp3-dependent inflammasome activation in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury an abundance of literature supports targeting this pathway in the development of therapeutic strategies in consideration of direct acting anti-viral agents viral load appears non- or minimally consequential in determining sars-cov and sars-cov-2 disease outcomes when tested in the context of sars-cov infection treatments targeting nlrp3 pathway components including nf-b inflammatory macrophages and ifn-i all demonstrated significant efficacy despite unchanged viral titers their respective human murine macaque andor in vitro models 5 35 106 107 196 in covid-19 clinical trials hydroxychloroquine demonstrated antiviral activity 197 198 yet without demonstrated clinical benefit 199201 the known role of nlrp3 in hyperinflammatory ards and crs documented nlrp3 involvement in mers-cov and sars-cov severity and apparent efficacy of anti-nlrp3 therapeutics in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 clinical trials and animal models strongly indicate that nlrp3 is a central mediator of severe covid-19 the potential central role of nlrp3 in severe covid-19 necessitates investigation into the therapeutic targeting of the nlrp3 inflammasometiming of therapy is critical as once individuals develop ards the chances of improved outcomes with therapy are severely reduced targeted therapy for individuals with moderate disease before the development of respiratory failure will be critical there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics that improve patient outcomes in severe covid-19 therefore targeting this pathway through existing available therapeutic options would represent an important and viable approach to reducing sars-cov-2-induced inflammatory cytokine signaling and immediately improve patient outcomesall authors listed have made a substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publicationthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestnovel coronavirus disease now known as covid-19 originated as viral pneumonia of unknown origin in the small province of wuhan china during december 2019 the causative agent was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international virus classification commission there have been two coronavirus mediated epidemic outbreak in the past two decades severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 within three months the spread of covid-19 to various countries of the world causing rapid rise in morbidity and mortality compelled the world health organisation who to declare it a pandemic on march 11 2020 as of may 27 2020 around 5488825 diagnosed cases of covid-19 with 349095 deaths have been reported source who covid-19 situation report 128 1 in india the total number of confirmed cases are 151767 with 4337 deaths till date 2during the last 4 months several studies on covid-19 have reported the clinical features laboratory findings and diagnostic evaluation of individuals suffering from this disease the mortality rate varies among various countries and depends on the patient clinical profile and presence of other comorbidities most of the patients with covid-19 suffer a mild course of disease manifesting clinical features of a viral pneumonia and gradually recover with supportive treatment but a proportion of them deteriorate to the severe form characterised by loss of respiratory function progressing to adult respiratory distress syndrome with occasional multiorgan failure 3 a vaccine to treat this disease is still under development and till then the only way to slow down the disease spread is by restricting the infectivity which is being tried by initiating social distancing and lockdown measures thus in the absence of any absolute cure it becomes essential to delineate the molecular mechanisms of this virus it is now known like sars and mers there is a considerable amount of immune dysregulation which may aid in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease the aim of this review is to summarize the inflammatory changes and immune dysregulation to outline the possible underlying immunological mechanisms of covid-19international virus classification commission has replaced the earlier name of novel coronavirus 2019 ncov-19 by sars like coronavirus 2 or simply sars-cov-2 it is a member of the coronaviridae family these viruses are enveloped positive sense single strand rna viruses genome size 3642 kb diameter 60140 nm having surface projections like a crown under the electron microscope this crown like appearance is the basis behind the name coronavirus so far four different genera of coronaviruses have been identified     among which two members of the -genera 229e and nl63 and two of the -genera hku1 and oc43 are known to cause mild respiratory illnesses in humans in the past 20 years two members of the -genera sars-cov and mers-cov have been responsible for the epidemic outbreaks of sars and mers respectively when people started being admitted in hospitals of wuhan china with features of fever fatigue and ards resembling pneumonia of unknown origin during december 2019 the viral genome sequencing of five such patients revealed the identity of a previously unknown - genera cov this novel coronavirus had 88 sequence similarity with two bat-derived sars-cov like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 and approximately 50 similarity with mers-cov 4like typical covs there are at least ten open reading frames orfs in the genome of sars-cov-2 orf1ab the first orf is about 75 of total viral rna and is translated into two large polyproteins these polyproteins are processed into a host of non-structural proteins nsps that constitutes the viral replicase transcriptase complex these nsps help in viral replication and transcription by rearranging the membranes originating from the rough endoplasmic reticulum into membranous vesicles the remaining orfs present in the other 25 genome encodes for spike s envelope e nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins the four main structural proteins of the virus 5 6 they also encode for various accessory proteins that do not play a role in viral replication their functions have not been identified so farit has been established that the sars-cov-2 needs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor primarily located in lung and gastrointestinal epithelia to gain entry inside cells the strength of binding by the receptor binding motif or the s protein is a significant predictor of the pathogenesis of infection 7 earlier the sars-cov which most likely originated in bats had a similar requirement of ace2 receptors and gradually adapted to ace2 receptors of other species and eventually infected humans the changes in the s protein in sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and other marine and bat forms of coronaviruses clearly indicate several synonymous mutations and non-synonymous substitutions in the related gene 8 all these genomic changes have rendered the sars-cov-2 capable for the attachment to human cells the other member mers-cov can bind to a functional receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 of multiple species including humansa lot of studies on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of covid-19 have been published in the last four months mostly on chinese population recently studies based on populations from other countries like singapore united states european countries are also being reported the major clinical manifestations of patients with covid-19 includes fever dry cough sore throat muscle pain and fatigue which in some cases may progress to severe symptoms like acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring critical care in the form of intensive care unit icu admission and mechanical ventilationfrom the meta-analysis of 19 different studies the most common clinical manifestations among the 656 covid-19 patients were fever cough and dyspnoea among all the patients around 328 developed ards 203 patients required critical care and 62 developed shock fatal outcomes were observed in 139 patients old age  60 years was significantly associated with the severity of the disease 9 these findings were supported by another meta-analysis which included eight studies comprising of 46248 infected patients further hypertension diseases of respiratory and cardiovascular system were significant risk factors for severity of covid-19 10 smoking history and diabetes were also added to the list of comorbidities following the meta-analysis of emami et al in which the data of 76993 patients were systematically analysed 11 among the routine laboratory parameters alanine transaminase alt lactate dehydrogenase ldh d-dimer c-reactive protein ferritin were significantly elevated in severe cases of covid-19 in comparison to non-severe cases a significantly lower absolute number of lymphocytes cd4t and cd8t cells along with downregulation of ifn- expression in severe cases was also observed 12 in another pre-print xiang et al reported serum urea creatinine and cystatin c may be potential biomarkers in severity of covid-19 13 huang et al reported higher plasma levels of interleukins il-2 il-7 il-10 and other inflammatory markers gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf- in covid-19 patients requiring icu care versus non-icu patients 14cytokines and chemokines are critical mediators of the immune system and play a pivotal role in anti-viral immunity studies have demonstrated that the primary cause of ards and multi-organ failure in covid-19 to be associated with cytokine storm 15 the inflammatory response plays a major role in covid-19 pathogenesis while cytokine storm increases the severity of the disease cytokine storm cs is a phenomenon of excessive inflammatory reaction mediated by the rapid production of large amounts of cytokines in response to infection 16 in covid-19 there is an initial delay in cytokine and chemokine secretion by innate immune cells with subsequent surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines il-6 tnf-  il-8 mcp-1 il-1  ccl2 ccl5 and ifns by the activated macrophages and other recruited lymphocytes these cytokines induce the recruitment and activation of adaptive immune cells like t cells neutrophils and nk cells along with further production of pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby causing a cytokine storm and tissue damagemost studies have drawn a parallel between the immune dysregulation due to covid-19 and the phenomena seen in sars-cov and mers-cov 17 at the early stage of sars-cov and mers cov disease there is a delayed release of ifn-1 and ifn- primarily by dendritic cells macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells which is followed by increasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as the disease progresses 18 the rapid surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to inflammatory infiltration of lung tissue by neutrophils and monocytes and cause lung injury moreover increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate t cell apoptosis and delay viral clearance 19 enhanced viral replication and heightened pro-inflammatory response injure the lung epithelial lining causing deterioration of the alveolar cellular barriers the endothelial cells are also damaged leading to changes in the microvasculature both of these injuries result in tissue hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 20 21 since the genome of the sars-cov-2 virus is related to sars-cov and mers-cov similar assumptions can be expected about the role of the host immune system towards this virus uncontrolled viral replication results in delayed anti-viral ifn response which in turn mounts an influx of neutrophils and macrophages at the site of injury with a concomitant surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines ie cytokine storm and thus leading to inflammatory injury to the respiratory system 22the cytokines elevated in the serum of covid-19 patients are il-1 il-2 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 il-17 g-csf gm-csf ifn- tnf- ip10 mcp1 mip1a and mip1b in particular il-6 il-1 and tnf- ie cytokines secreted by macrophages were found to be significantly higher in severe cases when compared to non-severe cases 23 table 1il-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a primary role in cytokine storm and therefore needs special attention in covid-19 it is a multifunctional cytokine involved in the formation of follicular helper t cells differentiation of th17 cell subsets and generation of plasma cells it is also known to inhibit ifn- and thereby suppress cd8  cytotoxic t cells 24 il-6 induces t cell exhaustion as indicated by markers such as pd-1 and tim-3 thus t cell-mediated immune response might be suppressed during cytokine storm by il-6 25 increased il-6 levels and its positive correlation with disease severity is suggestive of its role in disease progression 2532 recently a study from germany reported a 22-fold increased risk of respiratory failure with median time to mechanical ventilation of 15 days in cases with il-6 levels  80 pgml 33 higher circulating levels of il-6 were also reported even 24-h before death 34 35 therefore il-6 either as a single parameter or in association with other parameters could be used for early identification of patients at risk for respiratory failuretnf- a pro-inflammatory cytokine acting via its receptor tnfr1 may lead to apoptosis of aged t cells that express high tnfr1 36 therefore it is also known as a pro-apoptotic cytokine few studies on covid-19 patients reported a negative correlation of tnf- with t cell count 12 23 37 tnf- levels were significantly higher in elderly patients  60 years along with reduced t cell counts and increased levels of t cell exhaustion markers pd1 and tim-3 this finding speculates the role of tnf- as a negative regulator of t cell survival or proliferation 25 however a few studies reported no significant difference in tnf- levels in covid-19 patients 38 39il-1 and its family il-18 il-33 are significant players in ards and are known to increase the recruitment of immune cells and subsequent cytokine production 40 il-1 receptor signalling is involved in inflammatory damage to the respiratory epithelium in a study the daily transcriptomic profiling of three covid-19 patients revealed il-1 to show significant expression changes prior to deterioration of respiratory function all the other pro-inflammatory cytokines were induced only after appearance of symptoms of respiratory dysfunction this brief report hints at the plausible role of the il-1 pathway in the initial progression of covid-19 related lung immunopathology 41 il-1 and tnf- are cytokines that are required for the development of th17 cells and help in th17 mediated immune response and increased vascular permeability 40 the cytokines of the th17 pathway like il-17 and gm-csf increase in covid-19 patients 42 also increased expression of th17 cells in peripheral blood of covid-19 patients suggests a role for th17 cells in the cytokine storm in covid-19 as also reported in the patients of sars and mers 43significantly elevated levels of il-2 il-7 il-17 il-10 mcp- 1 mip-1a and tnf- were reported in severely ill patients in comparison to non-severely ill patients suggestive of diverse cytokine profile in the two groups and involvement of cytokine storm in disease progression and severity 23 an increased concentration of il-1 ip-10 ifn- and mcp-1 leads to the activation of th1 cell response which further aggravates the cytokine storm a similar rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines occurred in sars-cov and mers-cov infection 44 45 contrary to sars an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines of th2 cells il-4 and il-10 were also seen in sars-cov-2 patients 46 the implications of this finding are still yet to be clarifiedhigh serum cytokine levels in sars-cov-2 patients correlated with decreased t cell count in the peripheral blood suggesting a plausible role in disease progression diao et al reviewed total t cell count and il-2 il-4 il-6 il-10 tnf- and ifn- in 522 covid-19 patients admitted to two different hospitals in china and 40 healthy individuals and reported significantly higher levels of il-6 il-10 and tnf- correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between total cell count cd4   and cd8  cells and these interleukins further in the ten follow up patients il-6 il-10 tnf- and ifn- levels were significantly decreased in the recovery period than during the illness at the same time the t cell counts recovered to normal levels thereby suggesting that the decline in t cell is again associated with the surge of inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 patients 25 a similar negative correlation between t cell counts and interleukins was also reported in other studies 27 37 on the contrary wan et al who observed the associations of lymphocyte subsets cytokines with disease evolution in 123 chinese covid-19 patients 102 mild and 21 severe reported significantly different cd4  t cd8  t il-6 il-10 and pii between the two groups in the mild group significant positive correlations were observed between cd4  t and cd8  t and between il-6 and il-10 patients of mild group and with il-6 within reference range had higher survival rates but there was no correlation between cell count and interleukins 26a recent study attempted to immunophenotype the anti-viral response in covid-19 patients by single-cell transcriptome sequencing using pbmcs of 4 patients male young male elderly female young female elderly collected pre-icu during icu and post icu there was a significant increase in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cell populations in the icu samples when compared to pre and post icu samples 47 therefore there is evidence of delayed or dampened type 1 interferon response in the initial stages of the infection with subsequent increase with active viral replication a phenomenon also to be a part of sars-cov pathogenesis 19 22 a reported gene signature in the icu samples showed elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes isgs like ifitm1 when compared to pre and post icu samples suggestive of a critical viral load regulated type 1 interferon response type-1 ifn response in the disease progression and onset of ards 47covid-19 induced ards and mortality may be mediated by many factors alteration of both innate and adaptive components of the immune system in terms of dampened t cell response neutrophilia and delayed type-1 ifn response plays a significant role additionally increased expression of granulysin and perforin increase in macrophage activated cytokines like il-1 il-6 and tnf- leading to cytokine storm and increased t cell exhaustion might further contribute to the molecular pathogenesis approximately 15 of patients suffering from covid-19 progress to critically ill severe cases with the clinical symptoms of respiratory failure requiring ventilator support a cytokine storm accompanies the transition from mild to severe form of the disease in covid-19 patientsan efficient synergy between innate and adaptive lineages of immune system is a preliminary requirement for effective disposal of invading pathogens cells of innate immunity monocyte macrophage granulocytes and dendritic cells are the first to act whenever there is an invasion by foreign molecules the main function of innate immunity includes opsonization and direct clearance by complement activation in addition to elimination via phagocytosis however another important function is also to process and appropriately present the invading pathogen in order to activate the cells of adaptive immune system responses from adaptive immune cells not only aim to eradicate the pathogen but also reserves a memory of it for future protection in addition adaptive immunity also plays a crucial role in regulating the extent of immune response to prevent overstimulation and host injury our understanding of sars and mers though still limited have shown us that disease pathogenesis included host immune dysregulation along with direct damage caused by the viruses 22 understanding the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity cell subsets may thus provide substantial insight into the immunopathogenesis of sars-cov-2while the major mode of transmission of sars-cov-2 is primarily aerosolized droplets there is a possibility that a faeco-oral route also exists 48 initial symptoms of the disease include fever dry cough and rarely dyspnoea body ache headache and diarrhoea viral load is said to reach its peak 10 days post onset of symptom 49 studies assessing the clinical features of covid-19 patients have reported that the mean time for admission after onset of symptoms was 7 days iqr 48 while ards typically set in on 9th day iqr 814 27 admission in intensive care unit andor requirement of mechanical ventilation was seen in 16 cases with a mean time of 105 days iqr 817 3 sars-cov-2 is known to infect cells via the surface receptors ace2 and tmprss2 50 the cells are then known to undergo viral replication induced pyroptosis leading to release of il-1 and damage associated molecular patterns damps and pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps such as atp viral nucleic acid and asc oligomers these molecules induce the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il-6 il-10 macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 mip-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 mip-1 from the adjacent epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages the resultant microenvironment therefore attracts cells of both innate and adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory cascade sets in 23 45 in the case of mild form of the disease the infected cells and viral particles are rapidly cleared away by macrophages or neutralized by antibodies without any resulting damage to the airways from the host response however in some cases the disease progression has been seen to take a turn for the worse and is characterized by excessive cellular infiltration and a systemic cytokine storm 23 51 clinically this can be diagnosed as ards which is known to be the major cause of fatality in severe covid-19 cases 35 while age and co-morbidities have been identified to be associated with covid-19 induced severe respiratory distress syndrome underlying mechanisms responsible for the cytokine storm and immune dysregulation in uncontrolled disease are yet to be identified il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf were also higher in patients requiring icu that non-icu patients suggesting a possible different cytokine profile in severe and mild cases 23lung macrophages are therefore among the primary players in both effective host immunity against sars-cov-2 and in uncontrolled immunopathology of covid-19 studies which investigated the monocyte macrophage lineage in covid-19 patients have concluded that these cell lineages contribute to the cytokine storm by secretion of mcp-1 ip-10 and mip-1 49 single cell rna-sequencing based characterization of broncho alveolar lavage fluid balf from three severely ill three mild covid-19 patients and eight healthy controls have revealed that a monocyte derived fcn-1 macrophages were the predominant macrophage in the balf 52 these macrophages are known to be highly inflammatory and capable of producing large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and are also known to be involved in cytokine storm 52 analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc subsets in covid-19 patients have also shown an elevated level of cd14 and cd16 monocyte subset when compared to healthy controls the level of this highly inflammatory monocyte subset was also seen to be higher in covid-19 cases requiring intensive care 51 these monocytes also showed higher expression of il-6 and gm-csf thus suggesting a pivotal role in the advent of cytokine storm 51 hla-dr expression on cd14 monocytes of covid-19 patients were found to be significantly low among severe cases when compared to mild cases the levels of which improved on treatment with il-6 inhibitor toclizumab 53 higher levels of ccl-2 monocyte chemotactic factor was also seen in blood of covid-19 patients along with increased transcription of its receptor ccr-2 54early studies from wuhan china reported normal total leukocyte count with an imbalance between neutrophil and lymphocyte proportions in covid-19 cases 26 29 55 wu et al studied the immune profile of 201 covid-19 cases and reported significantly high neutrophil counts there was also a significant reduction in total lymphocyte count resulting in skewed neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr 29 neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were common findings presented by several authors and these findings were more significant among severe cases when compared to mild cases or healthy controls 23 27 28 34 56 pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines il-6 tnf mcp-1 released in response to local inflammation of infected lung epithelial cells and macrophages attract leukocytes and macrophages but not neutrophils to the site of inflammation this could explain the observed peripheral lymphopenia and neutrophilia proportion of other granulocytes such as monocytes basophils and eosinophils were observed to be low or within normal limits 55 57 58cells of the adaptive immune system are activated in response to antigen presentation and cytokine released by macrophages and dendritic cells on viral invasion a moderate decrease in b and nk cells with a significant decrease in total t cell count have been observed in covid-19 cases 26 28 37 51 55 5961 table 2 a retrospective study involving 452 covid- 19 patients reported significantly lower levels of t cells b cells nk cells and cd4 t helper cell subset showed the most significant reduction in severe cases when compared mild cases immuno-suppressive treg cells were also reported to be significantly lower among the cases showing severe disease progression the authors have thus reported that the t lymphocyte subset might be especially vulnerable to dysregulation in covid-19 55 higher viral load was also reported to be associated with severe disease spectrum 62 another study on 16 covid-19 patients attempted to differentiate between severe and mild cases with respect to activation function and exhaustion of cd4 and cd8 t cells along with other lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood of 10 mild and 6 severe cases the authors reported significant decrease in function of cd4 t increased activation of cd8 t cells which subsequently might lead to exhaustion of cd8 and reduced cellular immune response to covid-19 63 existing t cells were found to be in hyperactivated state as indicated by cd69 cd38 and cd44 expression in addition to ox40 and 41bb expression by cd4 and cd8 t cells respectively 51 ox40 and 41bb are tumor necrosis factor receptors tnfr implicated in t cell mediated cytokine production and stimulation of other t cells in addition to functional t cell markers exhaustion markers ie tim-3 and pd-1 co-expression were also found to be significantly expressed in severe cases 25 63 64 in contrary to adult cases a study on 8 paediatric patients showed an increase in cd4 and cd8 cells with a decrease in nk cells 65 in general paediatric patients showed better prognosis than adult patients which could be due to lower concentration of memory t cells to mount a cytotoxic response potent enough to cause tissue damageth follicular cells tfh are required for activation differentiation of b cells and are thus important for antibody mediated viral clearance tfh count was reported to be elevated in mild and recovering covid-19 patients when compared to healthy controls 66 67 a case study on a patient with non-severe covid-19 revealed an increase in circulating tfh at the same time of viral load decreasing to below lower limit of detection ct value  45 recruitment to peripheral circulation of immune cells including tfh seemed to herald the resolution of symptoms in this case 66 interestingly authors of another article which is in pre-print stage have reported increased cd8 t cell exhaustion assessed by expression of pd-1 and increased tfh cells in the peripheral blood of 38 non-severe covid-19 patients compared to healthy controls 67among the cytokines seen to be elevated in covid-19 some are th17 pathway specific such as il-17 il-1 tnf and gm-csf 42 these findings have prompted various authors to investigate the role of th17 in sars-cov-2 induced severe covid-19 cases a case study on a patient with severe covid-19 reported an elevated count of th17 cells activated cd8 and cd4 t cells 68 another study reported a decrease in th17 subset as indicated by low il-17 secretion 53 thus further studies are required to delineate the role of th17 specific response in covid-19a recent review suggested that major host immune dysregulations include dampened type-1 ifn response viral load induced hyperinflammation and recruitment of proinflammatory cells like neutrophils and monocytes 22 type-1 ifn response is crucial for induction of effective adaptive response and controlling viral replication a study conducted for immunophenotyping the antiviral response in covid-19 patients used pbmcs of 4 patients male young male elderly female young female elderly collected pre-icu during icu and post icu as per the finding by single cell transcriptome sequencing the authors have reported a significant increase in monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cell pdc populations in the icu samples 53 the authors have also reported a gene signature in the icu samples which showed elevated expression of ddx58 irf8 tlr7 and interferon stimulated genes isgs like ifitm1 when compared to per and post icu samples there is therefore evidence of delayed or dampened type-1 ifn response in the initial stages of the infection with subsequent increase with active viral replication a phenomenon also reported to be part of the pathogenesis of sars-cov 22 43 in a subsequent study involving profiling of immune cells whole blood transcriptome and cytokine levels in 50 covid-19 patients of varying severity authors reported a significant impaired type-1 ifn response in the critical patients this impaired type-1 ifn response characterized by reduced levels of ifn- and ifn- along with high il-6 and tnf- levels the study also revealed a significant downregulation of 6 isgs which specify type-1 ifn response in the severe covid-19 cases pdc population was also reduced in patients in comparison to healthy controls 54in the present scenario where every other day newer and broader clinical aspects of covid-19 are being searched focus also needs to be diverted towards one important issue ie why there is so much diversity in the response elicited towards the same disease by different individuals sars cov-2 is a novel corona virus despite this fact some patients developed a wide range of symptoms with severe abnormalities on the other hand some are completely asymptomaticmorbidity and mortality from diseases have a direct link with an individuals response to the disease 69 host genetic variation plays an important role in the varied immune response which in turn results in different disease outcome between individuals polymeric genes of host and their regulatory network influence immune responses to foreign compounds there is correlation between underlying genetic traits and phenotypes displayed 70 the host genetic variation impacts virus induced immune responses by individuals 71variability across human genes involved in antigen presentation to t lymphocytes is the major factor determining susceptibility or resistance to a wide range of infections human leukocyte antigen hla major histocompatibility complex mhc are molecules shown to regulate varied level of viral susceptibility and differential response the mhc gene family is comprised of 3 main subfamilies class i ii and iii genes located in proximity on chromosome 6 hla- abc belonging to mhc class-i and hla-dp dm do dq and dr belonging to mhc class ii mediate antigen presentation to t cells hla of class i and ii reside on cell membranes of all nucleated cells and antigen presenting cells respectively mhc-i and ii both have extracellular domains that form the peptide binding groove where antigenic peptide derived from different sources bind the bound antigens based on their source intracellular endogenous or extracellular exogenous are presented either to cd8 or to cd4 cells by mhc-i or mhc-ii respectively 72hla has already been studied as a major component of immune system responsible for varied immune response to pathogens hla genotype plays an important role in differential regulation and activation of t cells as well as disease transmission and duration 73 studies reported an increased severity towards the closely related sars-cov diseases in individuals with hla-b4601 genotype similarly response to disease caused by other unrelated viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 hiv-1 dengue virus is also linked with respective hla genotype of the host in case of hiv hla-a0205 reduces the risk of seroconversion 74 while in dengue hla alleles hla-a0207 hla-b51 were associated with susceptibility towards severe secondary disease among native thais 75studies have also investigated human genotype to determine putative hla alleles and their affinity towards novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 nguyen et al performed an in-silico analysis to check the binding affinity of viral peptide-mhc class i across 145 different hla types of the total alleles studied hla-a0202 b1503 c1203 were the most efficient conserved peptide presenters while hla-a2501 b4601 c0102 were shown to have very fewer binding peptides for sars-cov-2 in addition there were 56 other different hla alleles in humans which did not show any appreciable binding affinity all the three major class i genes exhibit similarity in peptide presentation across entire virus sars-cov-2 proteome and are independent of stage early or late of peptide and its production time 73 hla-b4601 allele was found to have the least predicted binding sites for sars-cov-2 and therefore individuals with this allele have less active immune response and thus more vulnerable to infection similar findings were reported in case of sars-cov infectionsa difference in hla haplotype may influence the individuals response to sars-cov-2 infection and certain haplotypes may be associated with increased disease severity thus hla genotyping may assist in identifying individuals at risk therefore hla testing is highly recommended along with covid-19 testing to enhance the sensitivity and to predict susceptibility to disease severity it is a rapid and reliable method that will assist in planning future vaccination strategyhuman infections with coronavirus such as sars and mers have occurred in the past however the present infection with sars-cov-2 has evolved to become a pandemic in contrast to the rest sars-cov-2 has shown to have similarities with its predecessors ie sars-cov and mers-cov in terms of genome sequence receptor affinity pathogenesis and disease presentation however our knowledge of mers or sars has not been enough to curb current covid-19 pandemic hence mandating the need to expand our knowledge on sars-cov-2 only a small proportion of the infected patients progress to severe stage needing critical care thus in absence of proper cure it becomes essential to delineate the factors that may aid in the severity assessment of the disease if individuals at risk of developing severe symptoms can be identified early management of the disease may improve to a significant extentin this review we have attempted to brief the virology and associated pathogenesis particularly in aspects of immunopathology invasion of lung epithelial cells and probably certain immune cells directly by sars-cov-2 via infectious aerosolized droplets heralds the infection peripheral neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia associated with delayed but exaggerated immune response mediate the fatal ards multi-organ dysfunction resulting in death of covid-19 patients while male gender increasing age and co-morbidities have shown to be risk factors for severe disease il-6 and tnf- were found to be potential markers of disease severity il-1 mediated pyroptosis and tissue injury can be hypothesised to be a major molecular mechanism underlying pathogenesis of covid-19 23 cytokine storm a phenomenon long studied in sepsis associated conditions has no successful effective management so far 76 future studies in different population groups should be designed with an aim to identify molecular targets that may help in early diagnosis and predicting severity of patients with covid-19 moreover alternative treatment modalities like drug repurposing using interleukin inhibitors plasma therapy is also another area that needs exploration 77 thus until a vaccine is available the main stay of treatment in covid-19 cases will continue to be supportive care while use of monoclonal antibodies mesenchymal stem cells and plasma of recovered patients are still in experimental stage being precautious and restricting movement is the only successful solution for reducing further spreadsince december 2019 the frequent incidence of pneumonia has become a distinctive feature of the infection caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus2 sarscov2 in wuhan hubei province china
1
 on february 11 2020 the world health organization who officially named this pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 covid19
2
 as of may 7 2020 a total of 3672238 confirmed cases and 254045 deaths have been reported in more than 214 countries 86095 confirmed cases and 4643 deaths in china
3
 considering its worldwide reach and severity who declared the covid19 outbreak a global pandemicthe first pandemic sparked by a coronavirus
4
 in contrast to the global infection rate reached by sarscov2 severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus sarscov 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov 2012 were largely localized to china and saudi arabia respectively
5
 like sarscov2 the outbreak of sarscov and merscov were also caused by the zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier the diseases caused by these three coronaviruses share similarities in clinical presentations such as progression toward severe acute respiratory syndrome
6
 yet covid19s clinical features remain distinct including unique pulmonary presentation on ct
7
 specifically with the sars epidemic dysregulation of the immune system resulted in acute fevers and decreased cd4 and cd8 t cell counts yet lacked any evidence of pulmonary changes upon imaging
8

the most common symptoms observed in covid19 patients are malaise dry cough and high fever symptoms of diarrhea hemoptysis and headache are not uncommon
9
 recently the centers for disease control and prevention usa expanded target symptoms of covid19 to include chills repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throat and loss of taste or smell disease can be mild or progress toward dyspnea andor hypoxemia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and septic shock which then can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods
10
 the main reason for death outcomes following sarscov2 infection is respiratory failure with changes in heart and liver function as a secondary or related consequence of disease
11
 
12
 
13
 epidemiologic data does suggest certain groups are at particular risk for severe disease outcomes ie elderly select preexisting conditions although we know there is a link between disease severity viral production and a cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome crs it is still unclear which molecular triggers fuel the onset of the cytokine storm and why it can quickly advance to ards or mods with a fatal outcome in a subset of patients
14
 
15
 it remains unknown if the observed cytokine storm and resulting leukocyte changes impact high and lowrisk individuals in the same way and how these factors can turn an otherwise natural protective cytokine response against infection into a lethal pathogenic processin this article we summarize reports on blood cytokine levels and leukocyte activation to examine for differences in immunopathogenesis between mild and severe cases of covid19 in patients from china data were obtained from reports from april 2019 to april 2020 supporting information fig s1 we also discuss emerging concepts on the interphase between leukocyte biology and disease pathogenesis last we summarize findings from ongoing clinical trials in china and united states that seek to control the onset or damage caused by the cytokine storm to reduce both morbidity and mortalitythe release of cytokines in response to infection can lead to mild or severe clinical manifestations the hallmarks of a mildnonlethal cytokine release response to infection include increased local temperature heat myalgia arthralgia nausea rash depression and other mild flulike symptoms concurrent to immune activation the body launches compensatoryrepair processes to restore tissue and organ function the term cytokine storm was first coined in 1993 to describe a graft vshost disease
16
 the term has since been extended to describe the similar sudden cytokine releases associated with autoimmune hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis sepsis cancers acute immunotherapy responses and infectious diseases
17

20
 cytokine storm occurs when an immune system is overactivated by infection drug andor some other stimuli leading to high levels of cytokines ifn il chemokines csf tnf etc being released into circulation with a widespread and detrimental impact on multiple organs
21
 the severe inflammatory responses induced by a cytokine storm start locally and spread systemically causing collateral damage in tissues
22
 
23
 to date it is unclear what determinants of the host response to infection are responsible for triggering the inflammatory sequence leading to the clinical syndrome associated with high cytokine release in general it is believed to be caused by an imbalance in immunesystem regulation ie increase in immune cell activation via tlr or other mechanism decrease in antiinflammatory response etc although the specific dysregulated molecular causes are still unknown a cytokine storm is nearly always pathogenic because of its detrimental effects on the host on the other hand local and systemic cytokine responses to infection are essential parts of the hosts initial response to infection release of cytokines by natural killer nk cells and macrophages along with activated t cells and humoral responses can help resolve infection accompanied by effector mechanisms such as antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity adcc
24
 these responses are triggered to keep the pathogen in check for example the local cytokines such as ifn and il1 produced by epithelial cells can protect nearby cells by stimulating ifnstimulated gene expression and concurrently activating immune competent cells such as nk cells this increases the nk cells lytic potential and fuels the secretion of ifn

 in addition to nk cells once myeloid cells such as resident macrophages are activated by ifn it amplifies subsequent tlrmediated stimulation this includes the release of high levels of tnf il12 and il6 which in turn can further modulate nk cells
26
 although il12 acts to increase nk ifn secretion high il6 levels also may limit the immune response by its effects on the cytotoxic activity of nk cells via the downregulation of intracellular perforin and granzyme b levels
27
 as disease progresses t cell and antibody responses give rise to additional cytokine responses leading to greater or sustained antigen release and added tlr ligands from viralinduced cytotoxicity
28
 once these responses are in motion other host or pathogenrelated factors ie decreases in pathogen load antiinflammatory responses genetics work together to prevent a dysregulated response or a crs that if allowed to develop could itself cause tissue damage and organ failure for example a lack of a negative feedback mechanism by il10 and il4 would be expected to increase the severity of cytokine responses toward a pathogenic crs or cytokine storm
21
 on the other hand targeting treatment to disrupt the formation of cytokine storm by using pharmacologic agents such as tocilizumab antiil6 may stabilize the advanced cases from transitioning to a more critical state
27
 
29

at the onset of sarscov2 infection there typically is a preferential infection of the respiratory track as a consequence of dropletbased viral transfer however a recent study
30
 supports the theory that sarscov2 also could potentially infect intestine enterocytes directly through angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes and may help to explain why diarrhea occurs with acute infection as well as the observed fecal shedding consequently having a broader infection footprint may impact the source of inflammatory cascades to include tissues other than the lungin covid19 disease a cytokine storm is common in patients with severetocritical symptoms at the same time lymphocytes and nk cell counts are sharply reduced with elevations in levels of ddimer creactive protein crp ferritin and procalcitonin
31
 consequences of a lethal cytokine storm exhibit diffuse alveolar damage characterized by hyaline membrane formation and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes
32
 
33
 the collateral tissue damage organ failure and poor outcomes of people with covid19 and its accompanying uncontrolled inflammatory responses share similarities with sars and mers in severe sars patients the serum levels of ifn il1 il6 il12 tgf mcp1 and il8 were higher than patients with mildtomoderate symptoms
34
 
35
 il1 il6 and il8 levels also were increased in the patients severely infected by merscov
36
 leukocyte and cytokine changes with severetocritical sarscov2 infection are further detailed belowin humans both monocytes and macrophages express ace2 and consequently can be infected by sarscov and sarscov2
39
 which results in the activation and transcription of proinflammatory genes
40
 intriguingly infection caused by sarscov2 appears to markedly downregulate the expression of ace2 on peripheral blood pb monocytes on a per cell basis which may be a secondary outcome to viral binding
41
 whether this downregulation of ace2 receptors is a surrogate to viremia remains to be determined in addition the expression of ace2 was found on cd68 and cd169 macrophages in spleen and lymph nodes of covid19 patients providing further evidence that sarscov2 infection may target ace2 positive myeloid cells throughout the body including the spleen and lymph nodes
42
 infected cd169 macrophages are mainly found in the red pulp section of spleens moreover macrophagerich areas at marginal sites of lymph nodes were more likely to test positive for viral nucleocaspid protein antigens of interest previous studies have demonstrated that cd169 macrophages are responsible for controlled levels of viral replication in support of developing immunity as a result of a refractory state to type i ifndependent activation
43
 this indicates that infection of cd169 macrophages might be a conduit for translocation of sarscov2 to spleens and lymph nodes this could be responsible for added systemic viral replication and may contribute to lower immunity see antigenspecific t cell section below human monocytic cell lines thp1 and u939 express ace2
41
 and thus may be useful in the in vitro study of myeloid modulation and role of tlr interactions in triggering activation before and after infection likewise hace2 transgenic mice should be harnessed as an animal model to study the biophysiology as well as the pharmacology of sarscov2 infection
44

monocytes from covid19 patients although normal in number show an activated phenotype as evidenced by their morphology fschigh and their capacity to produce il6 il10 and tnf
41
 activated monocytes present in the pb of covid19 patients were characterized by surface expression of cd11b cd14 cd16 cd68 cd80 cd163 and cd206 activation of the pb monocytes was particularly associated with disease severity and a poor prognosis
41
 expression of cd163 and cd206 by pb monocytes from covid19 patients suggest a bias toward a m2 or regulatory phenotype which could impact adaptive antiviral effector t cell responses apart from immune effects expression of cd163 in activated monocytemacrophage has also been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome
45
 which could potentially contribute to the hyperproduction of cytokine and immunologic pathogenesis in covid19 patients
46

wen et al
47
 also observed that an abundance of inflammatory cd14il1 and ifnactivated monocytes existed in the pb of covid19 patients in addition sarscov2 was found to trigger macrophages through ace2 generating il6 expression in the spleen and lymph nodes and il6 tnf il10 and pd1 expression from the alveolar macrophages
47
 
48
 this added mechanism might promote lymphocytopenia and contribute to a cytokine storm initiating in the lung as viral levels rise
42
 
48

autopsy reports indicated that inflammatory macrophages accumulated in the lungs of covid19 patients
49
 single cell rna sequencing confirmed that monocytederived fcn1
 macrophages were the predominant subset found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf of covid19 patients with ards which might be indicative of cells with high inflammatory and chemokine production
50
 the transcriptional analysis of balf and pb mononuclear cells from covid19 patients revealed high levels of ifninduced protein 10 ip10 and mcp1 which likely attracted the trafficking of macrophages to the site of infection a finding that is consistent with autopsy reports
51

orchestrated by delayed type i ifn signaling the activation and accumulation of inflammatory monocytemacrophage can result in a dysregulated inflammatory response and apoptosis of t cells
52
 the results of one ex vivo experiment in lung tissue
53
 showed that sarscov2 produced three times more infectious virus particles than did sarscov after 48 h however sarscov2 triggered fewer ifns and proinflammatory mediators than did sarscov this may contribute to the viruss ability to evade intrinsic innate responses at initial infection early type i ifns response may be particularly important preliminary reports showed ifn2b significantly reduced the length of time the virus could be detected in the upper respiratory tract this in turn reduced the duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers il6 and crp
54
 however the mechanism underlying sarscov2s ability to dampen initial innate responses at acute infection and suppress typei ifns to maximize viral release still needs additional studyas covid19 progresses the number of neutrophils in circulation gradually increase thus elevated neutrophil levels may be useful for predicting the severity of disease
55
 zhang et al
56
 reported that the neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio nlr combined with igg might be a better predictor than neutrophil count alone in predicting the severity of covid19 neutrophil extracellular traps nets which are extracellular webs of dnahistones released by neutrophils to control infections also are known to exacerbate inflammation
57
 
58
 previous studies have revealed that aberrant nets might contribute to ards cystic fibrosis excessive thrombosis and cytokine storm il1
59
 
60
 
61
 
62
 in severe cases of covid19 elevated levels of netosis with cellfree dna and myeloperoxidase mpodna have been noted frequently
63
 indeed when neutrophils from uninfected persons were exposed to serum from covid19 patients in vitro it triggered netosis indicating that patient sera may have the capacity to promote netosis in neutrophils
63
 
64
 apart from contributing to a cytokine storm increased netosis likely also impacts the onset of venous and arterial thrombosis in covid19 patients
65
 this finding raises the hypothesis that nets may be a central dysregulated pathologic mechanism driving cytokine release and multiorgan damage ultimately leading to respiratory failure and coagulopathy moreover the transcriptional analysis
51
 of balf and pb mononuclear cells from covid19 patients revealed that high levels of cxcl2 and cxcl8 may contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection further aggravating the pulmonary inflammatory response given these findings netosis may represent a viable therapeutic target for inhibiting crs and organ damage other important areas in neutrophil response such as interactions with humoral the role of iga and cd89 igg and cd16 etc or myeloid subsets remain unstudieddata on the nk cell response in covid19 is limited in sars nk cells were found to be useful in predicting disease severity and cd158b nk cells were associated with the presence of antisarscovspecific antibodies
66
 
67
 similarly a recent study showed that the number of nk cells in pb was decreased in patients infected with sarscov2 especially in severe cases
68
 but a separate report showed no difference in the number of cd16cd56 nk cells in mild vs severe cases
69
 therefore whether nk cells could be a predictor of covid19 remains to be determined additional studies are needed to determine whether nk cells can impact viral control ie directly or through adccmediated mechanisms or contribute to cytokine release during the disease course of covid19despite the role of dendritic cells and  t cells in respiratory infections
70
 
71
 there is currently no available evidence to show a link between sarscov2 infection and the modulation of myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells nor reports of how  t cells may impact the disease
72

t cell subsets change as covid19 infection progresses from mild to severe a singlecell sequencing study found target inflammatory genes were highly expressed by cd4 t cells and cd8 ctls underwent clonal expansion in the recovery stage of covid19 patients
47
 however in patients advancing to severe disease the number of t lymphocytes remained low as compared with mildstage patients with the levels of helper t cell subsets including th1 th2 and th17 at belownormal levels
68
 indeed numerous clinical reports show that the decreased frequency of circulating lymphocytes including cd4 and cd8 t cells is closely related to disease severity of covid19
75
 
76
 wang et al
77
 found that elevated il6 levels occurred 12 d prior to decreases in cd8 and cd4 t cells liu et al
78
 observed that cd4 and cd8 t cell levels dropped to their lowest levels after 4 to 6 d of illness whereas il10 il2 tnf and other cytokines reached peak levels these studies suggest a negative relationship between high levels of cytokines eg il6 il10 il2 tnf and lower circulating t cells in severe patients infected by sarscov2 likely because of redistribution of cells in tissue andor activation of induced cell death
79
 sarscov2 infection might induce lymphocyte apoptosis by enhancing the p53 signaling pathway or the fas signaling pathway
42
 
51
 a decrease in circulating lymphocytes as a result of tissue redistribution is consistent with the development of interstitial pneumonitis which is caused by mononuclear cell infiltration in severe casesweiskopf et al
80
 reported that sarscov2specific cd4 and cd8 t cells were detected in the pb of covid19 patients with ards at 14 d after the onset of symptoms furthermore antigenspecific central and effector memory responses were detected in virusspecific cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells of ards patients respectively with regard to cytokine secretion they proposed that in cases of severe disease the cd8 cytotoxic t cells predominantly secrete ifn whereas virusspecific cd4 t cells secrete expected levels of th1 ifn tnf and il2 and th2 il5 il9 and il10 cytokines in addition zheng et al
81
 reported that the proportion of multifunctional cd4 t cells ifn tnf and il2 with more than two positive cytokines among them was reduced in severe covid19 patients when compared to those with mild or no infection as multifunctional t cells are associated with better outcomes after vaccination
82
 a decrease in multifunctional cd4 t cells might infer a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe covid19 in covid19 patients with ards a decrease in cd4 and cd8 t cells was associated with an increase in cd38 cd8 394 hladr cd4 347 t cells
32
 zheng et al
81
 and chen et al
83
 further reported that cd8 t cells in the pb of covid19 patients exhibited an overactivated phenotype which is indicative of a sustained adaptive immune response whether effective or not in addition to an innate immune response of interest activated cd8 t cell responses appear to be ineffective as patients advance to severe stages of disease as evidenced by the exhaustive phenotype of cd8 t cells hladrtigitcd8 t cells
81
 consistent with an onset of t cell exhaustion chen et al
83
 found that t cells in the pb of severe covid19 patients expressed high levels of pd1 and tim3 the expression levels of pd1 and tim3 on t cells also was positively correlated with disease severityactivated t cells could also add fuel to the cytokine storm by further stimulating inflammatory responses from innate immune cells for example it was shown that the expression of il1 csf1 and csf2 on t cells may bind to the il1r and colony stimulating factor receptor csfr expressed on monocytes and further stimulate the activation of monocytes
47
 th1 cells in patients with severe covid19 were reported to stimulate the production of il6 by inflammatory monocytes
39
 which together with th17 cells
84
 may directly join innate immune cells in sparking the release of proinflammatory cytokines further contributing to the cytokine storm and subsequent organ damage
47
 
84

regulatory t cells tregs play a critical role in dampening an excessive inflammatory response as well as in antiviral immune responses
85
 therefore tregs may be central to maintaining a balance between antiviral immunity and the harmful cytokine storm to date the reports regarding the treg cells in covid19 patients remain inconsistent some studies found upregulated treg cells in severe illness whereas others reported that the number of tregs was reduced or unchanged in covid19 patients
68
 
77
 
86
 therefore the role of treg cells in the pathogenesis of covid19 needs to be further clarifiedcirculating b cells appear to be restored to normal levels in patients upon recovery from covid19 and convalescent plasma cp infusion further discussed later has been shown to be a potentially effective treatment as reported in 6 severe covid19 patients
87
 these findings support the hypothesis that humoral immune responses that boost sarscov2specific antibodies are important in the hosts resolution of sarscov2 infection and likely would help protect against reinfection
51
 
88
 
89
 of interest this ability to develop neutralizing antibody production and memory after infection may not be the same in all recovered patients recent data suggests that as many as 30 of recovered patients who had a milder disease course may develop low titers of neutralizing antibodies which may convey a higher risk for reinfection
90
 indeed several studies have detected higher antibody titers after recovery from more severe disease when compared with milder cases ie higher antibody titer in recovered elderly patients as compared with younger patients that often have mild or asymptomatic disease this suggests a disease course with a stronger immune response may also lead to greater protection against reinfection
90
 
91
 it is important to note that binding antibodies can also play a role in antibodymediated phagocytosis and antibodydependent cytotoxicity it remains to be determined if patients with low total or neutralizing antibody titers will have higher reinfection ratessimilar to cd4 t cd8 t cells and nk cells b cells were also markedly decreased in severe covid19 patients as compared with mild patients and the counts of b lymphocytes were negatively associated with viral burden
51
 aside from protection it also remains undetermined if prior exposure may prime the bodys response leading to antibodydependent enhancement ade effects for greater infection or an amplification of inflammation cascades previously ade had been reported in other viral infections such as sarscov thus ade if present may hinder the hosts ability to manage inflammation in lung and other tissues
52
 an analysis of 173 covid19 patients analyzed for sarscov2specific igm and iggs found that those with severe or critical disease had a high titer of total antibodies as well as a high igg response which were associated with a poor outcome and prognosis
92
 whether the increase in antibody titers during disease represents a secondary outcome of the hosts response to high viral titers or whether an ade mechanism could contribute to a sudden rise in viral load and onset of a cytokine storm remains undeterminedmany proinflammation cytokines such as il6 tnf il1 il2 il17 ifn gcsf mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 ip10 ifninduced protein 10 and others were found to be significantly elevated in severe covid19 patients table 1 and fig 1 a profile that is similar to that found in patients with sars and mers
36
 
93
 
94

as shown in table 1 the elevation of il6 was most frequently measured and detected in severe cases of sarscov2 infection zhou et al
39
 reported that the pathogenic gmcsfproducing th1 cells in severe covid19 patients induced il6 production from cd14cd16 monocytes and thus accelerated the inflammation associated with a cytokine storm elevated levels of il6 also were found in patients with exacerbating disease progression as evidenced by chest ct
95
 moreover chen et al
96
 reported that the serum sarscov2 viral load was closely associated with il6 levels in critical patients r  0902 high levels of il6 may also contribute to an increase in neutrophil cells and decrease in lymphocytes clearly il6 may impact the development of ards in covid19 patients
97
 and a rise in il6 may be a useful marker for severe disease onset furthermore as lungcentric coagulopathy can also play an important role in the pathophysiology in the severe covid19 patients
98
 il6 may contribute to this pathology by inducing coagulation cascades
99
 however hypercoagulability together with high levels of ddimers fibrinogen and crp in covid19 patients is distinct from the disseminated intravascular coagulation described in more severe inflammatory conditions
100
 
101
 further the levels of il6 can vary in covid19 patients relative to severity of disease
11
 
102
 it was recently shown that treatment with tocilizumab an antibody that blocks the il6 receptor resulted in poor outcomes in covid19 patients and did not prevent progression to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
103
 this suggests that il6 may be a major indicator but not the sole driver in the pathology of disease it is possible too that the stage of disease may impact the benefit of il6 blockage therapytnf is a master proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ra consequently antitnf biologics have become a firstline treatment for such diseases
104
 high levels of tnf often are produced in the initial response to infectious disease
105
 a recent study shows that the level of tnf 60130 pgml was higher than that of il6 1050 pgml in the plasma of severe covid19 patients
14
 therefore further investigation is warranted to define how tnf impacts immunopathology as well as the effectiveness of antitnf therapy in severe covid19 patientsin addition to examining il6 and tnf yang et al
93
 studied 48 cytokines in the pb from covid19 patients 14 of which were markedly increased among these 14 cytokines ip10 mcp3 and il1ra were identified as biomarkers for severity and fatal outcomes of disease they also found that the level of ip10 was markedly higher in patients with severe compared with mild disease a report from 10 covid19 patients with severe disease showed a marked elevation of ccl5 cc chemokine ligand 5 rantes importantly treatment with ccr5blocking antibody resulted in decreased il6 blood levels lower ifnrelated gene expression reduced sarscov2 viral load and a restoration of the immune homeostasis
106
 liu et al
107
 reported that 38 cytokines in the pb of covid19 patients were significantly increased and 15 cytokines il12 il1ra ip10 pdgfbb plateletderived growth factorbb tnf ifn mcsf macrophage csf il17 hgf gcsf il2 il4 il10 il1 and il7 were associated with severity of disease in addition some inflammatory markers such as crp and ddimer were also markedly elevated
102
 however unlike findings in sars patients
108
 covid19 patients showed increases in antiinflammatory cytokines such as il10 and il4
74
 indicative of an increased th2 response and subsequent pulmonary interstitial fibrosis last the results of singlecell rna sequence of early recovery patients infected with sarscov2 showed that il1 and mcsf may be novel mediators in the inflammatory response associated with a cytokine storm
47
 
77

a th17type cytokine storm caused by a mobilization of th17 responses has also been observed in both sars and mers patients
109
 
110
 it was reported that a high number of ccr4 ccr6 th17 cells which at least partially attributed to this immunopathology was also present in covid19 patient with ards
84
 markedly elevated cytokines ie il1 il17 tnf and gmcsf in covid19 patients have been associated with th17 responses
107
 these findings suggest that the th17type cytokine storm may lead or be associated with the onset of organ damage commonly observed in severe covid19 patients
84

taken together staging of sarscov2 infection are commonly divided into four stages mildcommonseverecritical all of which may have different magnitudes of cytokine release it is also possible that the qualitative features of the cytokine storm between disease stages may point to distinct host or pathogen triggers eg cytokine storm with or without concomitant bacterial pneumonia figure 2 summarizes the combined contribution of blood and lung tissue infiltrates and shows how added factors such as an accompanying bacterial pneumonia may exacerbate cytokine responsesclinical reports showing that elevated levels of il6 are associated with the immunopathology and disease severity of covid19
111
 have provided a strong scientific rationale for examining the effects of il6 or its receptor antagonists eg siltuximab and clazakizumab or sarilumab and tocilizumab in fact tocilizumab has been recommended in china to treat covid19 patients with bilateral pulmonary damage and severe symptoms
112
 early clinical reports of tocilizumab showed that fevers subsided in 20 severe patients within 1 d after the treatment and 95 of these patients achieved recovery sufficient to allow them to be released from the hospital within 2 wk
113
 guo et al
114
 showed that tocilizumab treatment 400 mg once through an iv drip
115
 attenuated overactivated inflammatory immune responses and boosted antivirus immune responses mediated by b cells and cd8 t cells furthermore luo et al
116
 recommended that tocilizumab be given repeatedly in low doses 80240 mg per time for maximal benefit taken together therapy to block il6 remains the most prevalent anticytokine treatment under investigation by contrast there are no registered studies in the chinese clinical trials register chictr to test the effect of il1 inhibitors for the treatment of covid19 although il6 is an attractive therapy target blocking il6 may not be beneficial in all patients as noted above treatment with tocilizumab can result in the onset of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in covid19 patients
103
 similar to antiil6 the effect of antagonists against other inflammatory cytokines in attenuating a cytokine storm is under investigation as of may 6 2020 a total of 49 clinical trials targeting cytokine inhibition were registered in the chictr and the national institutes of healths clinical research trials table 2 in addition to antiil6 strategies antagonistic antibodies directed against ifn il1 il1r tnf il8 gmcsf gmcsf receptor il17a and ccr5 are also under evaluation for their effect on the cytokine storm or in mediating excessive immune activation table 2 other approaches to suppress proinflammatory cytokine in covid19 patients have also been proposed for example given il37s ability to inhibit il1 il6 tnf and ccl2 conti and colleagues hypothesized that il37 may be useful in the treatment of covid19 patients with crs
117
 in another study the ccl5ccr5 axis was found to contribute to immunopathology
106
 in critically ill covid19 patients with elevated levels of ccl5 rantes as compared with patients who had mild or moderate cases of disease blocking the ccr5 antibody with leronlimab reduced il6 levels in critically ill covid19 patients and restored the cd4cd8 ratio leading to a marked reduction in sarscov2 plasma viremia
106
 deng and colleagues have also suggested that upstream targets such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate gmp  adenosine monophosphate amp synthase cgas anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk and stimulator of interferon genes sting may help reduce cell activation and cytokine release
118
 likewise jakstat signaling inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib have also been proposed for preventing crs
119
 table 2 apart from anticytokine treatment cytokine therapy with ifn2b was reported by huazhong university of science and technology wuhan china where treated patients saw reductions in their levels of il6 as well as a shorter duration in viral shedding
54
 ifnbeta1b has also been noted as beneficial when added to antiviral regimen that includes lopinavir and ritonavir
120

mscs are adult stem cells that have the ability to selfreplicate and which show potential for differentiation into multiple cell types
121
 mscs have the potential to impact antiinflammatory activities by producing immunosuppressive cytokines and by directly interacting with and inhibiting the activation of immune cells
121
 leng et al
88
 reported that 7 covid19 patients in beijing youan hospital beijing china were given mscs chictr2000029990 in this report 14 d after transplantation with mscs patients showed an increase in peripheral lymphocytes and cd14cd11ccd11bmid regulatory dc cells accompanied by an increase in il10 and a decrease in tnf those patients also saw a decrease in cytokineproducing cxcr3cd4 t cells cxcr3cd8 t cells and cxcr3 nk cells as of may 6 2020 a total of 40 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mscs transplantation in the treatment of covid19 patients have been registered in chictr and nih table 2 and supporting information table s1cp transfusion has been recommended for the treatment of patients experiencing a sudden disease progression and those with critical and severe disease according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of covid19 7th ed china
112
 it was previously shown that cp treatment could reduce the levels of cytokines in patients with severe influenza
122
 yang et al
73
 reported that the viremia of 10 covid19 patients was controlled and the lymphocyte counts increased after 7 d of cp transfusion similar beneficial effects also were reported in 6 severe covid19 patients
87
 however results from patients receiving cp remain limited as questions remain related to the optimal dose and best therapeutic window for administering cp for example patients in the early phases of infection have not been studied in addition cp often is combined with other treatments making it difficult to conclusively evaluate the true benefit of cp alone
119
 importantly the question of whether harmful ade could be induced by cp therapy remains under study
119
 directly removing cytokines and other toxins through blood purification using continuous renal replacement therapy hemoadsorption hemoperfusion and blood exchange have also been proposed as a way of containing the cytokine storm luo et al
123
 reported findings from three patients treated with plasma exchange in the first affiliated hospital of bengbu medical college bengbu china their results showed that the level of il6 was decreased and lymphocyte count increased after treatment current clinical trials testing the therapeutic effect of cp and blood purification are summarized in table 2 and supporting information table s2cq or hcq have been proposed as antiviral agents in the treatment of both mild and severe cases of covid19
124
 these compounds increase the ph of endosomes which may reduce sarscov2 infection by inhibiting cathepsin l an enzyme that is vital for cleavage of the viral spike protein
125
 leading to viral entry cq or hcq also have the antiinflammatory effects regulating myeloid activity by limiting its impact on endocytic tlr receptors tlr 3 7 9 and reducing peptide binding on mhc class ii proteins
126
 
127
 use of cq or hcq as treatment for covid19 has commonly been joined with azithromycin to prevent bacterial infections azithromycin also is often used clinically to dampen lung inflammation in other conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease providing added rationale for its use in covid19
128
 gautret et al
129
 treated covid19 patients n  20 with 600 mg of hcq daily with some patients n  6 also receiving concurrent azithromycin depending on their clinical manifestation results support the finding that hcq treatment can reduce viral load and its effect might be reinforced by concurrent use of azithromycin which as noted above could be the result of the antibiotics immunomodulatory effect as seen with other respiratory diseases lu et al n  13
130
 and zhang et al n  31
131
 registered number nct04261517 and chictr2000029559 shown in supporting information table s3 also reported that early treatment with hcq showed better outcomes negative covid19 nucleic acid of throat swabs shorter time to clinical recovery or shorter cough remission time in a retrospective study from yu et al
132
 hcq reduced the level of il6 and decreased mortality of critical covid19 patients n  48 suggesting that hcq could be an effective treatment in critical covid19 patientsof note it is still unknown if hcq has differing effects on cytokine and leukocyte levels when it is administered at different stages of disease therefore the effect of hcq on the immunopathology of crs in covid19 patients has yet to be determined likewise the therapeutic benefit of hcq has been challenged by data showing that longterm use of hcq in systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients did not prevent the onset of severe covid19 in a subset of sle patients n  17
133
 furthermore high cq doses 600 mg used in severe cases may lead to arrhythmias and cardiac complications
134
 although anecdotal reports suggest that cq or hcq may possess better efficacy in the treatment of early covid19 to date limited clinical studies have been published whether the efficacy of hcq is different in patients with varying degrees of severity and whether its clinical benefit if confirmed is because the drug limits immune responses ie preventing a cytokine storm or because it directly inhibits viral infection has not been fully explored so far a total of 83 clinical trials testing the preventative or therapeutic effects of hcq or cq on covid19 have now been registered table 2 and supporting information table s3according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of covid19 7th ed china tcm is recommended in the management and treatment of covid19 patients in china inspired by the purported efficacy of tcm in the treatment of sars more than 85 of patients in different stages of covid19 in china were treated with a variety of tcm herbal medicines see yang et al
135
 tcm strategies selected for covid19 were selected based on their immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties as determined by their use in clinics
136
 
137
 
138
 
139
 
140
 
141
 
142
 there also is evidence that the immunosuppressive features of tcm may convey beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of a cytokine storm
114
 a retrospective study reported that matrine and sodium chloride injection could markedly improve lymphopenia in covid19 patients possibly by inhibiting pulmonary inflammatory cytokines
143
 
144
 in an in vitro experiment zhu et al
145
 found that liquiritin could markedly inhibit replication of sarscov2 by mimicking type i ifn ma xing shi gan decoction mxsgd is a multiple component tcm preparation recommended by the guidelines for use in china findings from a network pharmacologic study and kegg enrichment analysis indicate that mxsgd has a number of beneficial effects including inhibiting cytokine storm
39
 to identify additional tcm with the capacity to inhibit cytokine storm in covid19 patients ren and colleagues
146
 screened the tcm database 2009 tcmd 2009 they searched for compounds that impacted the arachidonic acid aa metabolic pathway because it is essential for the synthesis of cytokines their study revealed magnolignan i lonicerin and physcion8odglucopyranoside were the most potent aa inhibitors and consequently suggested that herbal medicines which included these agents might be most useful in dampening a cytokine storm in patients
146
 we anticipate additional tcm strategies will be identified for the management of cytokine storm in covid19 patients for example ulinastatin a natural antiinflammatory substance from fresh human urine is believed to inhibit cytokine release and subsequent tissue injury
147
 and is currently under investigation as a treatment of covid19 patients
148

in addition to tcm corticosteroid treatment has been shown to dampen the inflammatory cascade from a cytokine storm
149
 a recent study found that early and shortterm administration of methylprednisolone could improve the clinical outcome in moderatetosevere covid19 patients
150
 although useful in critical patients as a tool for managing host inflammatory responses corticosteroids are not recommended in high doses nor for prolonged periods of time as they may dampen normal immune responses that could help contain the viral infection
146

 nevertheless there are a number of ongoing clinical trials table 2 and supporting information table s4 that may show if and when safe and beneficial corticosteroidbased treatment is indicated for treating in covid19last several immunomodulatory therapies including recombinant human ifnalpha rhgcsf iv immunoglobulin antibody vaccine nutritional supplements zinc vitamin c and vitamin d3 colchicine and cellular therapy are also under investigation for inhibiting a cytokine storm table 2 and supporting information table s4it is generally believed that the cytokine storm triggered by sarscov2 infection is a central mediator for the lung injury and resulting ards found in cases of severe or critical covid19 patients we present several leukocyte and cytokine changes that may help define the progression of covid19 from an initial to a late stage in both mild and severe cases however more needs to be learned regarding how elevations in specific cytokines combinations using standardized methods and defined ranges could be used to describe each stage of the inflammatory response as the disease progresses apart from commonly used surrogates of disease progression ddimer crp ferritin and procalcitonin levels with emphasis on ddimer and ferritin cytokinebased biomarkers still lack consensus on cutoff values for assessing disease progression other than a pattern of a rise with severity disease staging with an integration of cellular neutrophilia decreases in lymphocytes etc soluble plasma markers ddimer etc together with cytokine changes also remains to be pursued based on currently reported clinical data to date priority could be placed on combining elevations of il6 tnf il1 ip10 ddimer and ferritin with changes in circulating and activation states of myeloid neutrophil and t cell responses which together could provide improved biomarkers for progression to crs and severe covid19 patients although age combined comorbidities cardiovascular disease diabetes etc and bacterial infection have also emerged as risk factors for severe disease

 it remains unclear how each of these conditions changes the immunoregulatory cascade characteristics of the cytokine storm coagulopathy and other inflammatory outcomes defining shared or populationspecific triggers and amplifiers of a cytokine storm at specific disease stages will advance novel precision medicine strategiesother factors known to contribute to disease pathogenesis such as host genetics and epigenetics microbiome mucosal infection apart from lung immunoregulatory networks aging cooccurring disease exosomes complement neurologic endocrine and polydrug environments etc have yet to be fully investigated for example fogarty et al
98
 reported a potential 34fold higher thrombotic risk in caucasians which underscores the potential impact that race and ethnicity may have on disease outcomes although coagulopathy seems to be a severe complication in covid19 infection it may not necessarily be related to disease severity or exclusively present during or after a cytokine storm
156
 it remains undetermined how the onset of coagulopathy in the absence of compromised lung capacity ventilationperfusion or crs may be related to early press reports of higher stroke incidence in young and middleaged infected patients in the united states indeed it has been proposed that in predisposed individuals alveolar viral damage may trigger an underlying inflammatory reaction promoting a microvascular pulmonary thrombosis or endothelial thromboinflammatory syndrome affecting microvascular beds beyond the lung eg brain and other vital organs
157
 how immune factors identified in this review eg netosis il6 macrophage activation antibody response etc may contribute to damage to microvascular beds or how this damage predisposes incidence of a crs remains to be determined therefore there is a need to identify leading molecular triggers of multiorgan failure after a cytokine storm in order to prevent added lethal outcomesregarding therapy the timing and the best ways to combine various treatments also remains to be determined eg early antiviral therapy followed by anticrs therapy when that occurs
158
 there is also a need to extend immunopathogenesis studies beyond adults based on studies of covid19 clinical features in pregnancy it is known that neonates can be different from adults
159
 
160
 for example children rarely progress with a disease course requiring icu care regrettably the limited clinical trial activity focusing on children remains a missed opportunity to better address how to treat and limit transmission in this group

greater advances in all of these areas will allow for selective treatments both to target key pathogenic components of the cytokine storm and further advance highly targeted precision medicine strategiesjw mj xc and ljm wrote manuscript and designed figures jw and mj contributed equally to this workthe authors declare no conflicts of interestdiabetes hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases cvd are strongly related to a higher risk of mortality or diseases severity among covid-19 patients in china from 44672 confirmed cases 47 were critical with a case-fatality rate cfr of 49 patients without comorbidities had lower cfr 09 while those with cvds diabetes and hypertension had higher rates 105 73 65 respectively 1 obesity is another comorbidity raising the risk of complications in covid-19 infection the immune system acts upon inflammation that occurs in adipose tissue due to obesity increasing vulnerability to infections 2 increased circulating levels of many cytokines and proteins released by adipocytes are associated with inflammation in obese individuals 3 inflammation from adipose tissue generates chronic and systemic metabolic alterations leading to dyslipidemia hypertension cvd and diabetes thus increasing the risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-22 it is thought that sars-cov-2 as sars-cov and mers-cov suppress anti-viral type ifn- responses in the early stage of infection leading to an uncontrolled viral replication this mechanism later leads to an influx of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages resulting in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage lung tissue ie pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome specific th1th17 cells may be activated and contribute to increased inflammation these facts and the higher mortality by covid-19 observed in those with underlying diseases indicates that immune response is a determining factor to covid-19 outcome 4according to phylogenetic analyses sars-cov-2 is related to other existing respiratory infections such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov 5 sars-cov infection accounted for 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries 6 meanwhile mers-cov infection was identified in 27 countries with 2449 confirmed cases and 845 deaths 7 as is being observed in covid-19 mers-cov infection also caused more severe complications in older and immunocompromised patients with a history of diabetes renal failure and lung diseases 8 according to genome sequencing sars-cov-2 is about 89 identical to bat sars-like-covzxc21 82 identical to human sars-cov and about 50 to mers-cov 59 several phylogenetic analyses suggests the bat as most probable animal reservoir for sars-cov-2 and as both sars-cov and mers-cov were transmitted from bats to palm civets or dromedary camels and then to humans it is possible though that another animal plays the role of intermediate host between bat and human in sars-cov-2 infection 10 these viruses have a structural protein the spike glycoprotein s that is responsible for its binding to host cells 11 according to hoffman 12 protein s is primed by human serine protease tmprss2 and recognized by the cell receptor a recent study described by liu 11 shows that sars-cov entering in the respiratory tract depends on a receptor-binding domain rbd to bind to the host and protein s has two trimers that bind to the heterodimer of angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 a synthetic sars-cov-2 rbd analysis indicated that the virus enters into the host cell through ace2 binding however mers-cov binds specifically to another receptor dipeptidil peptidase 4 dpp4 1113 therefore since sars-cov-2 is analogous to sars-cov it is suggested that both use ace2 as the main mechanism for cell entrythe pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is not yet well understood it is known to cause an acute lung injury and that this condition resembles sars-cov which results in aggressive inflammation initiated by viral replication 14 in this review we tried to discuss and report possible mechanisms of inflammatory responses mediated by sars-cov-2 in individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases and to speculate possible therapeutic target that can be applied to obtain a better immune response reduce pro-inflammatory profile and consequently reduce critical levels of the diseasewe systematically searched the pubmed database up until april 23 2020 using the keywords covid-19 sars-cov-2 treatment of coronavirus and following terms diabetes mellitus obesity hypertension arterial ace-inhibitors cytokine storms immune response and vitamin d our database research results were accessed and relevant cross references were made to the proposed mini reviewthe immune system plays an important role in inflammation that occurs in adipose tissue due to obesity which increases vulnerability to infections inflammation in adipose tissue generates metabolic alterations that can cause comorbidities such as dyslipidemia hypertension cardiovascular diseases and diabetes thus increasing the risk of infection by sars-cov-22the overexpression of inflammatory adipokines from visceral fat deposits can affect the immune response impair chemotaxis and alter the differentiation of macrophages the imbalance between the secretion of anti- and pro-inflammatory adipokines from thoracic visceral fat deposits such as the epicardium and mediastinal may also play a role in the cytokine storm described in patients with severe sars-cov-2 a study demonstrated the active role of macrophages in morbid obesity and the relationship they have with inflammatory processes concluding that the disease of chronic inflammation initiated in adipose tissue is a consequence of insulin resistance 20hyperleptinemia tissue dysfunction low antioxidant defenses chronic inflammation and the generation of postprandial ros are factors involved in the development of obesity in which oxidative stress participates 21 as the increase in oxidative stress in accumulated fat is at least in part the underlying cause of adipocytokine dysregulation and the development of the metabolic syndrome 22 it is known that obesity induces oxidative stress through various mechanisms such as chronic inflammation endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction 23 interestingly it was reported that adiponectin predicted mortality in critically ill patients after admission to the intensive care unit icu the innate inflammatory response of visceral fat deposits can cause a positive regulation and greater release of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 24in addition adipose tissue serves as a reservoir for several viruses such as influenza a hiv and cytomegalovirus and may also be infected by the covid-19 virus 2 for being an important source of il-6 and its receptor il-6r therefore adipose tissue can serve as a reservoir for the activation of il-6 and cascade signaling of viral infection the spread of viruses from organs affected by adjacent adipose tissue can take days with prolonged viral shedding also contributing to the delay of the cytokine storm and consequent tissue damage in patients with covid-19 2526diabetes mellitus dm is a major risk factor for severity and mortality in individuals infected by sars-cov-2 similar risk evidence among people with diabetes has been reported for the previous two cov infections sars in 2002 mers in 2012 27 studies have associated diabetes with greater weight loss and increased lung inflammation with macrophage infiltrates similar to those observed in the disease 27 the risk of infections in patients with diabetes can be reduced although it cannot be completely eliminated by good glycemic control for all people with diabetes over 2 years old pneumococci and annual vaccination against influenza are recommended in addition patients with diabetes have a serious disease when infected with respiratory infections in fact diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza h1n1 in 2009 sars-cov and mers-scov 28 glycemic homeostasis requires close quantitative and temporal regulation of glucose flow through different organs most of the circulating glucose in the body is in a stable configuration similar to the biochemical characteristics of the cell wall from commensal bacteria found in the individual 29 in the immune system host-pathogen and host-host interactions take place through the recognition and binding of oligosaccharides in so-called c type lectin receptors clrs which will induce a specific immune response several c type lectins recognize oligosaccharides rich in sugars such as mannose and fucose which have a similar chemical structure to glucose 30 as sars-cov-2 recognition is through protein s a glycoprotein it may as well increase inflammatory processes 12 in addition the connection of sars-cov-2 with ace2 in people with uncontrolled hyperglycemia may be important in covid-19 pathogenesis possible changes in ace2 glycosylation as well as viral peak protein s glycosylation both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia may alter both virus binding to ace2 and immune response intensity against the virus 31thiazide-type diuretics calcium channel blockers ccb -blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers arb are antihypertensive drugs with distinct targets to lower blood pressure the acei and arb drugs targets the renin angiotensin system ras and are also used in diabetes treatment leading to an increased ace2 expression that has been suggested by fang 32 as risk increaser for severity of covid-19 since sars-cov-2 uses ace2 to enter the cells in contrast the study by meng 33 in a hypertensive chinese population with covid-19 under treatment with aceiarb drugs displayed an attenuated inflammatory response by inhibiting il-6 cytokine levels they achieved a better clinical result higher cd3 and cd8 t cell counts in peripheral blood and lower viral load peak in comparison to other antihypertensive drugs in addition during hospitalization 12 patients from the non-aceiarb group 48 were considered severe and one patient died versus aceiarb group with 4 severe patients 235 and no deaths therefore there is no evidence that increased ace2 expression by these drugs is indeed harmful and further studies are needed to clarify their effects on covid-19 infection also the il-6 controlled levels leading to better clinical results showed that an equilibrated inflammatory response is determining a better outcome for covid-19 diseaseit has been reported that patients with severe symptoms of covid-19 present the cytokine storm cs phenomenon an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines cs can be triggered by infectious diseases rheumatic diseases and tumor immunotherapy and it generally presents as systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure 34 among the consequences of cs on lung viral infections are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis resulting in vascular leakage and alveolar edema ultimately leading to hypoxia impaired t cell response accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages changed tissue homeostasis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the last being a primary cause of death in sars-covmers-cov patients 35 the levels of inflammatory factors were measured in a study reported by huang 36 including 41 covid-19 patients 13 icu and 28 non-icu patients il-1b il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon- ifn interferon--inducible protein ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a tumor necrosis factor tnf vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and others inflammatory factors were increased in both icu and non-icu patients compared to healthy adults icu patients showed higher concentrations of gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf than non-icu patients suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with higher disease severity a retrospective cohort study conducted by zhou 37 reported elevated il-6 blood levels in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course of covid-19 illness other studies also reported il-6 increased levels in patients with severe covid-19 38 39 40 in anhui china a clinical trial chictr2000029765 using the il-6 receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody mab tocilizumab reported improvement of respiratory function and rapid fever control in 21 patients with severe covid-19 all patients recovered and were discharged from hospital including two who were in critical condition 41 this indicates the need of targeting anti-inflammatory strategies to the treatment of covid-19 and demonstrates that a balanced immune host response is crucial to eliminate sars-cov-2 infection successfullygiven the need for a balanced immune response vitamin d stands out its action is mediated by binding its active form 1--dihydroxyvitamin d3 vd3 to its receptor vdr expressed in several immune cells 4243 vd3 has a genomic binding site vdr-gp in which a transcriptional complex is formed modulating the expression of genes such as ace and the vdr itself 42 according to sassi 42 individuals with respiratory infections and sepsis had exacerbated symptoms and reduced vd3 levels when using vd3 as an experimental treatment protocol in patients with respiratory infections it was observed infection reduction and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 and il-6 which are produced by helper th1 cells 42 besides on acting on the immune system this hormone plays an important role in metabolic disorders such as the pathophysiology of diabetes modulating the expression of insulin and reducing systemic inflammation regulating blood pressure by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas and in obesity regulating adipogenesis and the production and release of adipokines and cytokines as vd3 is connected to various metabolic pathways and immune system response it becomes important to identify it as a therapeutic target 43individuals with cardiometabolic diseases are more prone to sars-cov-2 infection due to immune response dysregulation as the inflammatory response does not occur immediately the role of medications generally used by individuals affected with diabetes hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases especially ace inhibitors is debatable since those drugs lead to ace2 receptor overexpression associated to sars-cov-2 cells entry after virus entry into the cell it multiplies until reaches many copies generating a more acute and late inflammatory response thus a storm of cytokines occurs that end up harming healthy cells in order to regulate inflammation and reduce damage to healthy cells vd can modulate a favorable immune response and could hypothetically reduce levels of associated complicationsms thays maria costa de lucena tmcl conceived this mini-review and along with ms

maria eduarda de albuquerque borborema meab and phd jaqueline de azevdo silva jas discussed the content revised and adjusted the written materialcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sustained by the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 started in china in december 2019 in the province of hubei and then rapidly overspread over the world becoming a pandemic the 22 april 2020 the european centre for disease prevention and control reported 2520522 infected subjects around the world with 176786 deaths httpswwwecdceuropaeuengeographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases 1101681 people were infected in europe and 825041 in usa with 107453 and 45063 deaths in europe and usa respectively httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovcases-updatescases-in-ushtmlthis great number of infected subjects is requiring an enormous worldwide effort for hospitalizing and caring all patients who have to receive firstly an adequate diagnostic approach chest x-ray or ct viral genome identification and quantitation serology then the best possible therapies that might avoid the more severe phase of disease from the clinical point of view the majority of patients remains asymptomatic or presents mild symptoms mizumoto et al conducted an epidemiologic study on the 3711 people who remained on board of the diamond princess cruise ship blocked in japan after identification of a sars-cov-2-positive passenger these authors estimated that 179  of all infected cases remained asymptomatic during quarantine 1 another group estimated that the rate of symptomatic cases was 10110000 after a median incubation time of 14 days 2 moreover the italian covid-19 surveillance group during the peak of infection reported 460 deaths on 85308 infected individuals 99  with an overall case-fatality rate around 72  substantially higher than in china 23  thus highlighting the compelling need for more effective approaches the median age of infected subjects was 62 years 85  of deaths occurring in patients between 70 and 89 years moreover only 12  of infected patients presented at the hospitalization without comorbidities while 235  had one 266  two and 486  three or more comorbidities the most frequent concomitant diseases resulted previous ischemic heart attack or stroke atrial fibrillation hypertension diabetes dementia a recent history of cancer chronic liver disease or renal failure only 75  of patients did not present any symptom at the hospital admission 127  were pauci-symptomatic 379  and 196  manifested mild and severe symptoms respectively while 44  were critical httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirus in the international scenario the most frequent clinical manifestations were fever and dyspnea whilst cough diarrhea and hemoptysis were less common acute respiratory distress syndrome ards was observed in 96  of severe cases followed by acute renal failure in one third of them super-infections were documented in 85  of critical cases where septic shock and the macrophage activation syndrome mas were the most frequent cause of death 34 from the early stages of infection patients develop lymphopenia and neutrophilia in the more advanced cases lymphocyte further reduce liver failure appears with hypoalbuminemia and the hyper-inflammatory status characterized by high levels of reactive protein c ferritin d-dimer ldh troponin and n-terminal fragment of the b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp is demonstrable 56the pathogenesis of this hyper-inflammation have been recently revised chemokines such as mcp-1 il2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mip-1a and il6 are highly expressed whereas tnf-alpha seems to be only moderately up-regulated cytotoxic cd8 and exhausted t cells together with an abnormal balance between th1 and th2 lymphocytes mirror the onset of a severe immune dysfunction 7 consequently several approaches able to switch off inflammation by maintaining at the same time the hosts antiviral immunocompetence have been rapidly designed and tempted chloroquine already employed in rheumatological diseases inhibiting the attack of the sars-cov-2 to the ace2 receptors that represent one of the two virus receptors resulted quite effective 8 alone or in combination with azithromycin 9 tocilizumab an anti-il6 antibody already used both in rheumatoid arthritis 1011 and in the cytokines release syndrome after infusion of car-t in patients affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia or aggressive lymphomas 1213 has been employed with success in covid-19 recently an italian group proposed a new treatment algorithm whose backbone is represented by chloroquine tocilizumab is used precociously in all patients with high levels of il6 and d-dimer including those especially the elderly cases with hypoxemia without severe dyspnea 14 other possible options from the rheumatological background are the anti-il1 monoclonal antibody anakinra already effective in the mas 15 and the jak12 inhibitors such as baricitinib already employed in rheumatoid arthritis 16 used alone or in combination with intravenous immunoglobulins 14 in 22 april 2020 a clinical trial aimed to assess the baricitinib effectiveness in severe covid-19 has been authorized by the italian drug agency aifa httpswwwaifagovitsperimentazioni-cliniche-covid-19 finally anti-tnf alpha antibodies such as adalimumab prescribed for the treatment of psoriasis 17 and behcets disease 18 have been proposed as possible furher therapeutic tools for covid-19 pandemic 7in this apocalyptic scenario some authors already observed that this rheumatological approach notwithstanding a clear fast and positive anti-inflammatory effect could impair the immunological control of neoplasms in patients receiving chemotherapy or immunotherapy for cancer indeed cancer patients showed a higher rate of severe events after sars-cov-2 infection in comparison with patients without cancer 39  vs 8 19 this epidemiological observation in addition to the consideration that the majority of reported comorbidities in patients with critical covid-19 were diseases characterized by a pro-inflammatory profile underlines once again the need of identifying further drugs exerting a significant anti-inflammatory action but without losing their anti-tumor effect on the basis of these considerations we decided to review literature and what hematologists know about the relationship between hematological drugs inflammation and immunity in order to help the scientific community to definitively fight the covid-19in hematology we have a well-known similar condition that mimics the hyper-inflammation caused by the new coronavirus the graft-versus-host disease in its acute agvhd and chronic forms cgvhd gvhd which interests about half of transplanted patients can appear by or after 100 days from the allogeneic stem cell infusion with a prevalence that ranges from 35  to 55  according to donor type conditioning regimen disease status at transplant and prophylactic approach 2021 gvhd is the consequence of a misleading attack by donor t lymphocytes of several recipients antigens recognized as outsiders with consequent damage of hisher liver lungs gastrointestinal tract eyes vagina muscles and joints allogeneic t and b lymphocytes sustain this hyper-inflammation that causes tissue damage and fibrosis both by increasing production of inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-2r il-6 tnf alpha and by the deposition of immune complexes the intestinal epithelium damage releases bacteria and modifies the gut microbiome further increasing the immune response t cd8 lymphocytes are especially activated by the recipient hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells apc whereas donor t cd4 cells can be activated by other apc types principally in the gut the participation of other immunocompetent cells such as nk macrophages monocytes and neutrophils makes gvhd a hyper-inflammatory dangerous condition that well recapitulates what occurs in covid-19 where the rapid coronavirus replication impairs the ifn-induced immune response with rapid increase of m1-oriented macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokines 7 moreover clinical manifestations especially of the agvhd are similar to those observed in covid-19 skin rash diarrhea elevated bilirubin infections pulmonary leak syndrome eye and mouth damage and in the chronic form also fasciitis myositis and fibrosis that mimic the systemic scleroderma 2223another covid-19-like condition that hematologists and rheumatologists have to deal with is the macrophage activation syndrome mas an acute hyper-inflammatory condition characterized by activation and expansion of t cells and hemophagocytic macrophages with the consequent cytokine storm with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-18 tnf alpha and ifn gamma 24 mas is reported to interest about 4 of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus but it can also represent a complication of hematological neoplasms or infections with a mortality higher than 40  that makes mas a real medical emergency 25 from the diagnostic point of view mas is a febrile condition characterized by hyperferritinemia multilineage cytopenia coagulopathy transaminitis high levels of triglycerides hypofibrinogenemia and splenomegaly classically mas is treated with high steroid doses and etoposide 26 but in the era of new biological drugs promising results derived from the use of anti-il1 and anti-il6 antibodies like anakinra canakinumab rilonacept and tocilizumab 27in agvhd treatment includes topic or systemic corticosteroids anti-thymocyte immunoglobulins cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil for appropriate management of acute phase novel approaches also include mesenchymal stem cells etanercept and infliximab anti-tnf alfa daclizumab anti-il2 or vedolizumab anti-a4b7 but results are still very preliminary and not worth to be considered for translating the experience deriving from the agvhd new era directly to the covid-19 28 about cgvhd as inspirating source also in this case the first line approach is represented by immunosuppressive agents 29 that seems to be not really effective in covid-19 7
tocilizumab anti-il6 monoclonal antibody has been used also for treating agvhd with 70  of partial remissions pr nevertheless in a series of 11 patients 2 developed a bacterial sepsis one of whom died 30 until today 23 trials have been registered in the clinical trialsgov website thus supporting the promising use of this drug in covid-19 rituximab has been also used as therapeutic tool in gvhd with 60  of overall response rate orr however as reported by the italian cooperative group gitmo 338 treated patients died for infections 31 and in a meta-analysis involving 111 cgvhd patients one third of them presented pneumonitis and herpes virus reactivation 32 no studies involving this monoclonal antibody have still registered in the clinical trialsgov website in our opinion the use of rituximab in the covid19 could be not considered either for the high rate of infections reported in the hematological context or because rituximab requires a too long time to be efficacious

begelomab a monoclonal anti-cd26 antibody has been recently reported to be efficacious in treatment of 69 steroid-refractory agvhd patients in the compassionate use begelomab was administered at 3 mgm2day for 5 days followed by six additional doses of 3 mgm2 at day 10 14 17 21 and 24 the overall response rate at one month was 75  in the prospective studies and 61  in the compassionate use with complete response rates of 11 and 12  respectively response in grade-iii gvhd was higher than 70  and response in grade-iv gvhd cases about 60  with higher response rates described for skin liver and gut the tolerability of treatment was good with the most common adverse events being diarrhea cytomegalovirus reactivation infections probably more linked to the gvhd and the previous steroid treatment than to the antibody itself in the 8 complete responders there was only one late death due to infections in the 38 partial responders the infection rate was 105  33 recently the dpp4cd26 glycoprotein has been reported to be one of the two receptors for the spike s1 sars-cov2 surface protein together with the angiotensin converting enzyme ace2 34 once activated by sars-cov-2 this protease helps virus 1 to reduce autophagy the process physiologically aimed to eliminate external microorganisms from the host cells 2 to sustain the hyper-inflammatory status and 3 to reduce the host anti-viral immune response 35 the hypothesis of destroying this strict link by the anti-cd26 antibodies or the dpp4 inhibitors already employed in the diabetic patients seems really interesting 36 dpp4 inhibitors have been already demonstrated to be efficacious in several in vitro models of sars 34 and considering the 80  of homology between old and new coronavirus dpp4 inhibitors might be useful also in the covid-19 pandemic 37 nevertheless no studies with begelomab have still been registered in the clinical trialsgov website considering these novel findings about the possibility of destroying the cd26 axis connecting coronavirus and inflammationperturbed host immunity in our opinion the use of begelomab probably for a short time course might be considered an interesting approach worth to be tested in the covid19
in the last two years fda and ema licensed ibrutinib as treatment for steroid-refractory cgvhd ibrutinib already effective in high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll 34 in addition to the bruton kinase also inhibits another kinase the interleukin-2inducible t-cell kinase itk that is involved in the selective activation of t-cells that drive immune reactivity toward healthy tissues 38 and a src kinase hck whose over-expression in a murine model has been reported to be responsible for extensive pulmonary inflammation and enhanced immune response particularly in older mice 39 in cgvhd ibrutinib switching off the cytokine storm was successful in two third of cases with 21  of complete and 45  of partial responses 40 with a significant improvement of patients quality of life 41 unfortunately this treatment is characterized by adverse events that cause treatment discontinuation in 30  of patients in particular pneumonitis fatigue and diarrhea of grade 3 occur in 71  of patients in the first year and in 25  in the second year inducing therapy discontinuation in 40  of cases 38 in agreement with these results the experience in cll reported high infection rates in a cohort of 378 patients serious infections were observed in 114  of cases especially bacterial and fungal 42 at the moment no clinical trials using ibrutinib in covid-19 have been registered in the clinical trialsgov website nevertheless treon and coworkers in the last days published in blood an interesting report concerning the low rate of covid-19 occurrence in patients with waldenstroms macroglobulinemia only 6 out of 300 individuals all patients experienced cough and fever as prodromal symptoms the 5 patients on ibrutinib 420 mgday experienced no dyspnea and did not require hospitalization with a shorter disease course in comparison with the one patient receiving lower ibrutinib dose who on the contrary required the administration of tocilizumab and iv immunoglobulins 43 in our opinion ibrutinib might be a potential candidate for fighting the cov-2 but probably if used for a short time due to the high number of infections and treatment discontinuations that usually characterize its use in the hematological scenario clinical trials are needed to conclude if the balance weighs more on the side of efficacy or toxicity
the other drug licensed by fda and ema for treatment of gvhd is ruxolitinib already successfully employed for reducing spleen dimension and improving quality of life and survival of patients affected by myelofibrosis 44 ruxolitinib a jak12-inhibitor decreases the activity of th1 lymphocytes and through modulation of the stat pathway the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf alpha il1 il6 and ifn gamma 45 ruxolitinib is effective both in acute and in chronic gvhd in 71 cases of steroid-refractory agvhd ruxolitinib offered 55  of orr and 27  of cr especially in skin gastrointestinal tract and liver median duration of response was 345 days and the overall survival os at 6 months 510  cytopenias occurred in half of cases peripheral edema in 45  but no significant infective toxicity has been reported 46 in another cohort ruxolitinib at a dose of 20 mgday offered 571  of orr reported adverse events were anemia thrombocytopenia neutropenia infections edema bleeding and transaminitis 47 in the cgvhd ruxolitinib has been reported to be effective in 80  of patients nevertheless reactivation of cmv occurred in 15  of patients 48 in a meta-analysis including 414 patients with cgvhd during treatment with ruxolitinib infections occurred in 20  of patients more frequently sustained by bacteria 55  and cmv 39  49 the pro-infective aspect of ruxolitinib is also evident in myelofibrosis where cases of hepatitis b 50 and tuberculosis in 14  of cases 51 reactivation in addition to pneumonitis sustained by pneumocystis jiroveci 52 have been reported in the last weeks 8 clinical trials with ruxolitinib in covid-19 started with dose ranging from 10 to 20 mgday the first 11 cases treated in italy avoided the incoming intubation so confirming in the real life the anti-inflammatory power of this jak12 inhibitorin our opinion ruxolitinib could represent a very good candidate against covid-19 for its well-known powerful and fast anti-inflammatory effect nevertheless the high rate of viral and microbial reactivation observed in the hematological setting might represent a caveat in its prolonged use in the covid-19another class of drugs already employed in the treatment of gvhd that could help to win the covid-19 challenge are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis already successfully employed in treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia cml philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and stromal gastro-intestinal tumor gist 53 imatinib has been the first tki licensed for cml treatment followed by nilotinib dasatinib bosutinib second generation tkis and ponatinib third generation tki all tkis and especially those of second and third generation in cml offer high rates of complete hematological cytogenetic and molecular responses 53 necessary key for treatment discontinuation tfr that has success in about 40  of patients 54 different studies focused on tfr explored the impact of tkis on the immunological response showing that this class of drugs play a positive effect on nk cells whose number and activated status is fundamental for maintaining deep molecular response without treatment 5556 moreover tkis are able to restore the immunocompromised status observed in cml patients at diagnosis by reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells re-activating t and nk cells and reducing the expression of pd-1 on t and nk lymphocytes and of pd-l1 on the microenvironment and on neoplastic clone 57 imatinib has been employed with success also in gvhd but mainly in its chronic form where it was successful in about 60  of cases 58 from the safety point of view in a series of 19 cases only one pneumonitis and one cns infection by jcv have been reported 59 in another cohort with sclerodermic gvhd imatinib was compared to dasatinib one of the 4 patients receiving imatinib had pneumonitis versus 2 of the 5 cases treated with dasatinib 60 two trials proposing imatinib in covid-19 have been already registered in the clinical trialsgov website nct04357613 nct04356495 both involving elderly patients in a third study imatinib will be compared to hidroxicloroquine lopinavirritonavir and baricitinib nct04346147in our opinion imatinib might represent a good therapeutic possibility in the covid-19 for its demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity added to a good safety profile but a caveat has to be done about the delayed onset of its positive therapeutic effects

dasatinib has not been further used in gvhd but the toxicities that it causes in cml might contraindicate its use in the covid-19 in fact about 25  of cml patients develop pleural effusion during dasatinib treatment 61 several mechanisms have been explored from the inhibition of pdgfr beta to increased t lymphocytes in pleural fluid 62 in multivariate analysis a previous skin rash or history of autoimmune disease resulted as significant factors predicting pleural effusion 63 about infective risk during dasatinib administration the incidence of grade 34 infections resulted 11  64 in the dasision trial which compared dasatinib with imatinib as first-line treatment 45  of patients in the dasatinib and lessa than 1 in the imatinib cohort died for infections so sustaining the high infective risk of dasatinib in comparison to imatinib 65 at the moment no studies with dasatinib in covid-19 have been registered in the clinical trialsgov website on the basis of available data in our opinion dasatinib might be not a valid candidate for the covid-19 treatment
on the contrary different promising suggestions come from some in vitro and in vivo models that would support the use of bosutinib as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent this tki is today indicated for treatment of cml imatinib-intolerant or resistant patients 66 differing from dasatinib whose pro-inflammatory action is supported by the high rate of pleural effusion bosutinib resolved this adverse event in 1720 cases presenting effusion during treatment with dasatinib moreover the safety of bosutinib from the immunological point of view is supported by the quite total absence of infective adverse events 67 moreover in a model of membranous glomerulonephritis bosutinib was able to ameliorate renal damage by reducing expression of il2r il4r and by inhibiting jak2jak3 that sustain the inflammatory pathway 68 in another murine model of intra-cerebral hemorrhage with brain injury caused by post-bleeding inflammation bosutinib once more showed its anti-inflammatory action inhibiting sik-2 it activates creb and ikb so blocking the nf-kb-derived inflammation moreover bosutinib shifted the macrophagic response from m1 to m2 and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines production 69 bosutinib and nilotinib were also used and compared in a murine model of alzheimers disease where brain plaques are considered a consequence of hyper-inflammation in this context both tkis decreased inflammation by reducing tnf alpha il4 il6 il3 and il2 levels and increasing il10 and cx3cl1 but in comparison with nilotinib bosutinib increased il-10 and cx3cl1 also in the peripheral blood 70 thus the anti-inflammatory profile of bosutinib is evident about its safety in the before trial where bosutinib and imatinib were compared in 536 cml patients in first line grade 34 infection rate was 34  in the bosutinib versus 49  in the imatinib arm with only 04  of upper respiratory tract infections in the cohort treated with bosutinib 71 all these data suggest that bosutinib might have a relevant anti-inflammatory effect with a good safety profile at the moment no studies with bosutinib have been registered in the clinical trialsgov website nevertheless in our opinion bosutinib could be considered a possible effective drug in the covid-19 nevertheless no experience with this drug has been done in gvhd or mas

nilotinib is a valid second-generation tki approved for treatment of cml in first or subsequent lines 72 nilotinib is now in experimentation also in gvhd on the basis of data from the preclinical studies that clearly demonstrated its anti-inflammatory power indeed nilotinib significantly reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-2 ifn-gamma tnf alpha il-17 tgf beta without losing the lymphocyte immunocompetence 7374 nevertheless no definitive data on nilotinib safety in gvhd are still available consequently safety profile must be derived from the experience in cml in the enestnd trial comparing nilotinib and imatinib in 564 cml patients in first line all grade infection rate was 17  in the nilotinib versus 14  in the imatinib arm with grade 34 infections rate in the nilotinib cohort less then 1 75 in conclusion nilotinib seems to be an anti-inflammatory agent with a good infective safe profile these features could make it in our opinion a good candidate in the covid-19 setting nevertheless we have to consider its high rate of cardiovascular complications seen in cml 7677 that could be the consequence of the inflammatory endothelial damage as shown by higher il6 and lower il10 levels in cml patients presenting cardiovascular events 78 at the moment no studies with nilotinib in covid-19 have been registered in the clinical trialsgov website in our opinion this pro-atherogenic aspect might made nilotinib a sub-optimal candidate in the covid-19 context
interferons ifns are old but at the same time evergreen drugs for many years used for treating different hematological diseases from cml and philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms mpns to lymphomas and myeloma due to their potent immune enhancing capacity that allows recognition and elimination of neoplastic cells by the patients immune system in cml interferon has been used until the introduction of tkis its offered hematological and cytogenetical but very few molecular responses nevertheless for many years it represented an advantageous treatment in respect of hydroxyurea 79 in mpns ifns are still successfully employed especially in younger people where their discontinuation after long-term treatment may be followed by several years with normal cell counts and low-jak2v617 f burden that once again supports the concept that ifn-alpha is able to modulate and enhance the immune system-mediated defense against cancer 80 in lymphomas ifn is still the first line of treatment of hairy cell leukemia 81 and with less fortune has been employed as maintenance therapy in indolent lymphomas especially after autologous transplantation 82 in multiple myeloma ifn has been demonstrated to reduce plasmacells growth by down-regulating the il6 production with a synergic action with melphalan and corticosteroids in reducing the monoclonal component ifn has also been used as maintenance after autologous transplantation before introduction in the clinical practice of lenalidomide and bortezomib but with doubt favorable prognostic impact 83 moving from the hematological context to the sars during the outbreak of 2002 ifns were also tried a meta-analysis including 54 studies with ifn was performed in 2006 with discordant results indeed while the in vitro studies showed a good anti-viral power of ifns with ifn beta being more effective than alpha the in vivo studies were inconclusive with a doubtful prognostic advantage in respect of steroids 84 at the moment 6 studies aimed to understand if ifns might be useful in covid-19 have been registered in the clinical trialsgov website trying either ifn alphabeta or lambda nct04344600 nct04350671 nct04343768 nct04343976 nct04254874 nct04320238 interestingly one of these studies is employing the ifn alpha via aeresol probably in order to avoid the systemic adverse events flu-like syndrome fatigue hypothyroidism creatinine increase that frequently lead to the drug discontinuation in the hematological patients 85 the use of ifn lambda type iii ifn seems interesting based on different action mechanisms that characterize tipe i and iii ifns indeed for decades type i ifns ifn alpha and beta have been explored as mediators of rapid innate antiviral protection in 2003 a novel group of three cytokines now known as type iii ifns ifn lambda have been discovered the distinctive actions of type i and type iii ifns depend on the engagement of different receptors type i ifns trigger pro-inflammatory responses via the recruitment and activation of immune cells promoting an anti-viral state in the host while type iii ifns signal is restricted to epithelial cells and neutrophils therefore type iii ifn administration as a prophylactic treatment or at an early stage of covid-19 might result in a good antiviral response localized to epithelial cells reducing side effects and inflammation associated with the systemic action of type i ifns 86 in our opinion considering the actual availability of different clinical options because of their poor tolerability ifns might be not good candidate in the covid-19 therapy
after this analysis we became convinced that in addition to ruxolitinib imatinib and bosutinib would represent possible interesting therapeutic tools in the covid-19 war thus we decided to contribute to the covid-19 challenge by confirming ex vivo the anti-inflammatory power of imatinib and if and how it could modify the immunological profile of our patients thus we used the nanostring technology nanostring seattle usa for analyzing the immune transcriptome profile of 5 patients affected by cml at diagnosis and after 6 months of treatment with imatinib the tested rnas have been already stocked in our laboratory as leftovers that the respective patients donated to us for further non-profit researches after routine diagnostics we employed the human ncounter myeloid innate immunity panel that measures the expression value of 770 genes involved in 19 different pathways fundamental for the innate immune response results were analyzed by the ncounter advanced analysis 20 software in fig 1
we represented some of the up- red squares and down-regulated green squares genes by volcano plots and in the table 1
are listed all down- in green or up- in red regulated genes and the pathways where they are involved in table 2
we better detailed all genes that resulted significantly deregulated after imatinib their respective physiological role and their possible contribution to inflammation and immunological infection control overall 40 genes resulted down- and 18 up-regulated by imatinib 35 of these down-regulated genes may sustain the inflammation in different autoimmune diseases whilst 5 are anti-inflammatory after imatinib-induced gene expression down-regulation the final effect was a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines mrnas unfortunately these data are not completed by the quantification of cytokines in the serum because of the retrospective nature of the study on the other hand among the 18 genes those expressions increased after imatinib 15 support the physiological innate immune response more in detail among the down-regulated ones we found some genes that are highly expressed in autoimmune diseases anx4a high in the sjogrens syndrome 87 casp10 high the crohns disease 88 while ceacam8 89 ctsg 90 and il18 91 are overexpressed in arthritis moreover clec5a increased after neurogenic shock 92 cxcl2 and grn are highly expressed in the alzheimers disease 9394 itgam was elevated in psoriasis 95 and pglyrp1 had high levels in chronic gingivitis 96 all these genes were down-regulated by imatinib as a demonstration of its anti-inflammatory action at the same time the anti-inflammatory effect exerted by imatinib was also sustained by the reduced expression of the genes that identified the mast cells fig 2
 our nanostring analysis also demonstrated that while imatinib reduced inflammation the patients immunocompetence was not lost indeed imatinib down-regulated several genes that physiologically impair the t- and nk-cell response such as arg1 97 c3ar1 98 ceacam1 99 gsn 100 and nectin1 101 on the contrary this tki up-regulated some genes that usually support the immune response such as jak3 able to switch the macrophagic response from m1 pro-inflammatory to m2 anti-inflammatory 102 socs3 which had a low expression in arthritis 103 while tlr3 displayed low levels in inflammation and during viral infections 104 interestingly imatinib on the other hand also increased expression of some genes relevant for the antiviral response cxcl16 105 havcr2 106 ifng 107 rnase2 and rnase3 108109 finally during imatinib treatment an increase in t cytotoxic and activated nk cells has been observed fig 2in conclusion even if preliminary our findings agree with data already published by alves et al that reported an increased number of nk cells and lower il21 levels during treatment with tkis and ifn 110 and support the hypothesis that imatinib might be a very good candidate to fight covid-19 due to its anti-inflammatory action in a context of a conserved and efficient immunological infection control fig 3
in table 3
we resumed characteristics pros and cons of drugs that on the basis of above reported considerations might be translated from the hematological scenario to the cov-2 pandemic nevertheless a further consideration has to be done about the costs of these possible new treatments in 2018 a group of researchers from the mayo clinic performed a costeffectiveness analysis on 1047 patients treated for cgvhd among the drugs that can be used against covid-19 in that study on cgvhd the cheapest resulted chloroquine 9181 us followed by imatinib 43965 us and ruxolitinib 97807 us 111 in our opinion the final list of the hematological drugs that could represent promising options in the covid-19 war might include also ruxolitinib bosutinib imatinib and begelomab ruxolitinib probably is the fastest and more powerful agent in the switching off the cytokine storm as already shown in agvhd and also in the first covid-19 cases treated with this jak12 inhibitor nevertheless its doubtful safety from the infective point of view probably might impose at least the need of a careful observation of the immunocompetence in covid-19 patients also considering that super-infections have been documented in 85  of them tkis could be tried as further options in different models of inflammations bosutinib showed optimal anti-inflammatory properties already demonstrated by its ability of reverting the pro-inflammatory effects of dasatinib in addition data coming from the experience in cml sustain its good safety profile and sustain the hypothesis of a rapid efficacy also imatinib displays a good anti-inflammatory effect its use is characterized by a low infection rate it is worth to remember also that imatinib remain the cheapest drug and probably the tki most frequently available worldwide begelomab probably for a short period of time might also be an interesting option for its capacity of destroying the strict negative link between coronavirus and inflammation actorsthus all considered in a hypothetical hematological-driven algorithm see graphical abstract we could imagine using begelomab for blocking the first steps of infection ruxolitinib to rapidly switch off the cytokine storm in the severehyperacute phase and then to sustain immunity that ruxolitinib is not able to do and the required long-term anti-inflammatory effect by tkis on the other hand the combination of ruxolitinib with nilotinib has already been adopted in a phase-i study in cml patients with unsatisfactory molecular response without significant infections occurrence 112 in the last few weeks many trials with some of the above mentioned drugs started and will gave us soon fundamental information indeed the war against sars-cov-2 has to be continued rethinking drugs use with a multidisciplinary approach could be a possible improvement for the final victorys galimberti and c baldini wrote the manuscript all authors revised and approved its galimberti c barat and m petrini were speakers in the events supported by novartis pfizer celgenebms janssen roche incyte and members of advisory boards for novartis and janssen a di paolo was a speaker for medac gmbh novartis roche incyte and was an advisory board member for novartis c baldini and f ferro do not have any conflict of interestpathogenesis of covid-19 infection is a subject of active research however no effective therapy has yet been developed for this disease caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus initially sars-cov-2 infects upper respiratory tract epithelial cells if the infection is limited to these cells the disease usually manifests mild symptoms severe pneumonia can develop when the virus enters alveoli of the lungs and infects type ii pneumocytes the infection inhibits interferon response while upregulates expression of chemokines attracting immune cells monocytes b and t lymphocytes 1 excessive extravasation of these cells from the vessels into the alveoli is considered the main cause of pathogenic changes in the lungs leading to the development of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 2in severe cases of covid-19 infection the virus can enter bloodstream and infect endothelial and other target cells in kidneys esophagus bladder ileum heart tissues and central nervous system the endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns damps released from the dead cells additionally activate immune cells and support development of the cytokine storm thus in severe forms of covid-19 infection multiple organ failure associated with hyperactivation of the immune system is observed patients with covid-19 infection in critical condition often have high systemic inflammatory parameters including levels of c-reactive protein and cytokines il-6 tnf il-8 etc 3-5increased generation of reactive oxygen species ros by immune cells and oxidative stress 6 inevitably accompanies the cytokine storm inflammatory cytokines and ros act together activating pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells this leads to disassembly of cell contacts increased permeability and influx of edematous fluid into alveoli resulting in an impaired gas exchange in the lungs in addition cytokine storm and oxidative stress lead to ros-dependent apoptosis of endothelial cells 7 which contributes to the release of coagulation factors and clot formation 8corticosteroids and inflammatory cascade inhibitors based on monoclonal antibodies are currently used for the treatment of the cytokine storm in covid-19 infection tocilizumab anti il-6 secukinumab anti il-17a canakinumab anti il-1 ruksolitinib phosphate jak kinase inhibitor etc 4 use of corticosteroids for treatment of covid-19 infection showed noticeable constraints related primarily to the suppression of specific immunity and an increased risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia 9 10 limitations of the monoclonal antibody therapy include their narrowly targeted action at only one of the many inflammatory cytokines thus it is extremely important to develop new approaches to prevent cytokine storm during the covid-19 infectionthe transcription factor nrf2 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is responsible for adaptation of cells under electrophilic or oxidative stresses under normal condition nrf2 is located in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitor keap1 which targets nrf2 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in the presence of electrophiles or ros the keap1-nrf2 complex dissociates and nrf2 migrates to the nucleus where it stimulates transcription of the target genes with antioxidant response element sequences in their promoters 11 nrf2 controls expression of the genes participating in antioxidant response redox homeostasis biogenesis of mitochondria etc activation of these genes protects cells from inflammation 12 nrf2 stimulates expression of hemoxygenase ho-1 which is responsible for degradation of the pro-inflammatory free heme and formation of the anti-inflammatory compounds  co and bilirubin nrf2 also upregulates production of the antioxidant enzyme nadph quinone oxidoreductase nqo1 as well as of the key enzymes of glutathione biosynthesis which functions as the main cellular antioxidant nrf2 knockout mice suffer from an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction involving activation of innate immune cells increased production of cytokines chemokines and ros all these factors contribute to cell and tissue damage 13nrf2 activation results in suppression of inflammation not only through the antioxidant response but also through the nrf2 transcriptional repressor activity in human macrophages nrf2 inhibits expression of the inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and tnf 14 it was shown in numerous animal inflammatory models that nrf2 inducers decreased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines 12 15-17 protective role of the nrf2 activation in numerous inflammatory processes was also demonstrated for airway epithelium and vascular endothelium 18-22 dozens of clinical trials are currently underway to test the efficacy of nrf2 inducers for prevention and treatment of inflammatory and respiratory diseasesthe main facts and observations justifying feasibility of the nrf2 activation in treatment of covid-19 infection are summarized below1 excessive inflammation in covid-19 infection is associated with high lethality 3 activation of nrf2 reduces inflammatory response preventing expression of the inflammatory cytokines 14 and activation of the macrophage inflammasomes 23 24 nrf2 inducers also reduce inflammatory reactions in patients with acute and chronic diseases 252 ards is the main mortality factor in covid-19 patients 26 activation of nrf2 protects airway epithelium from disassembly of the intracellular tight junctions during inflammatory exposure and subsequent development of ards 273 an impaired vascular permeability is a key event in the covid-19 pathogenesis leading to endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis 28 induction of nrf2 protects vascular endothelium from damage caused by the oxidative stress or inflammatory cytokines 294 severe cases of covid-19 are accompanied by an increased oxidative stress 30 there are some cases of successful treatment of covid-19 with glutathione 31 key enzymes of glutathione biosynthesis are controlled by nrf2 32 the decrease of nrf2 activity promotes oxidative stress and nrf2 activation increases glutathione content in the body and restores redox balance in the organism 335 age is an important risk factor for severe covid-19 infection 34 nrf2 activity decreases with age 336 hyperglycemia is another risk factor in covid-19 infection 34 nrf2 activity is reduced in patients with hyperglycemia 357 mortality and severity of covid-19 infection is higher in men compared to women 34 sexual differences in nrf2 activity in humans are unknown but female mice have higher nrf2 activity compared to males 36so far no attempts have been made to investigate nrf2 inducers as the therapeutic drugs that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in infections caused by sars-cov-2 this task can be solved by repurposing of the drugs or drug candidates that are able to activate nrf2 response a wide range of compounds can be used to activate nrf2 including the following1 sulforaphane is a plant-derived compound found in cruciferous plants such as broccoli and brussels sprouts the effect of sulforaphane on reducing circulatory inflammatory cytokines has been demonstrated in many animal models 37 currently about 70 clinical trials with sulforaphane are conducted targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma arthritis cancer and others sulforaphane is well tolerated orally in daily doses up to 200 mol reaching therapeutic plasma concentrations 382 dimethyl fumarate is a dimethyl ester of fumaric acid in the usa it has been approved by the fda for treatment of recurrent multiple sclerosis trade name tecfidera and in germany for psoriasis trade name fumaderm interestingly dimethyl fumarate reduces inflammatory reactions in both nrf2-dependent 39 and nrf2-independent ways 40 413 sodium thiosulfate is a drug used intravenously and orally it is a safe substance used to treat various intoxications sodium thiosulfate is a hydrogen sulfide h2s donor which is a nrf2 inducer hydrogen sulfide maintains redox balance of the cells and has an anti-inflammatory property 42 the compounds releasing h2s have anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities against a wide range of pathogenic viruses 43 a review paper has recently been published justifying the use of inhaled form of sodium thiosulphate for patients with covid-19 infection 444 epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a polyphenol found in green tea this non-toxic compound displays an anti-inflammatory activity both in vitro and in vivo 45 in addition epigallocatechin 3-gallate is an inhibitor of furin  a protease that processes sars-cov-2 s protein and facilitates virus penetration into the cell 46-485 resveratrol is a plant polyphenol resveratrol activates nrf2 by decreasing the expression of its negative regulator keap1 and activates sirt1 deacetylase 49 oral administration of resveratrol leads to the decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines il-1 and tnf and activation of the expression of nrf2 target genes nqo1 and glutathione s-transferase 50 resveratrol enhances synthesis of endogenous glutathione and protects alveolar epithelial cells from oxidative stress 51these drugs are mainly used to treat chronic rather than acute inflammatory conditions therapeutic efficacy of these nrf2 inducers is unknown for the cytokine storm and ards potentially nrf2 inducers can be used to prevent cytokine storm or during its manifestation in combination with already used anti-inflammatory drugsfor most of the proposed drugs toxicity and bioavailability are already known which allows for a quick start of the relevant clinical trials to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in covid-19 infection it seems reasonable to use nrf2 inducers together with glutathione biosynthesis precursors eg n-acetylcysteine this therapy can be used to reduce damage to cells and tissues to prevent respiratory failure and ardscoronaviruses are a family of enveloped positive sense single-strand rna viruses that infect mammals and birds in humans coronavirus infections typically cause mild respiratory disease including seasonal colds yet some members of the family can be highly virulent in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 structurally related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers was identified in wuhan china its efficient transmission r0 of 22 facilitated its spread across the globe with the first detected case in the usa reported on january 19 20201 on march 11 2020 who declared the outbreak a pandemic2
the ongoing covid-19 outbreak is challenging every aspect of daily life including the implementation of public health policy the nature of social interactions adaptation of the workforce to a new normal and the medical research and clinical care infrastructure including the care for oncology patients economic forecasts are concerning and a global financial crisis is anticipated mathematical modeling based on available data shows that in the face of rapid geographical spread and a high case-fatality ratio even the most advanced healthcare systems are very likely to be overwhelmed in the coming weeks and months3 it will be critical to identify therapies with low barriers to rapid clinical deploymentit is becoming apparent that in some patients severe covid-19 disease occurs and is accompanied by a fulminant and damaging immune reaction sometimes called the cytokine storm characterized by pronounced infiltration of macrophages and monocytes into the alveolae a pro-inflammatory t-helper 17 th17 response and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines particularly il-6 il-1 il-8 interferon gamma ifn and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf47 this pro-inflammatory cytokine profile has been with poor prognosis and severe lung pathology characterized by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates diffuse alveolar damage hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary edema810
as the oncology community rallies behind our colleagues in intensive care internal medicine emergency medicine and infectious disease the immunotherapy field is poised to offer insights into the application of immune-modulatory therapies modulation of il-6 in particular which has emerged as a potentially promising option for covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is used for the treatment of some rheumatological disorders11 and has become a mainstay in recent years in the management of cytokine release syndrome crs after chimeric antigen receptor car t cell therapy for hematological malignancies1214 although the cytokine levels observed in patients with covid-19 experiencing ards are much lower than those seen in crs after delivery of car tcell therapies and cd3-based bispecific tcell engagers the cancer immunotherapy communitys experience in using the il-6 receptor antagonists to modulate severe inflammatory pathology in the setting of crs may prove to be useful in identifying therapies that could be of use in this settinghealthcare and research organizations continue to aggressively pursue development of a vaccines and effective therapeutic strategies to attenuate the burden of sar-cov-2 including antimalarial antimicrobial and directed antiviral agents as well as convalescent serum from patients who have cleared virus and recovered and to support patients through the severe inflammatory response and pulmonary complications that can frequently occur the aim of this analysis is to describe available strategies that could alleviate the burden on the healthcare system with a specific emphasis on therapeutics that could block or modulate the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary complications caused by covid-19 in particular il-6 il-1 and tnf pathways15
sars-cov-2 causes the emergent respiratory disease called covid-19 one of the challenging aspects in management of the infection is that different presentations have been identified16almost 75 of patients with covid-19 acute respiratory disease present with abnormal findings on chest ct scans ground-glass opacities are the most common finding reported in as many as 60 of patients other findings include patchy infiltrates and interstitial lung disease although some patients present with minimal imaging abnormalities5 7 17 19
pathological findings resemble those seen in sars and mers edema proteinaceous exudates focal reactive pneumocyte type ii hyperplasia patchy cellular inflammation and multinucleated giant cells9 notably neutrophil infiltration is not significant20
elevated c reactive protein crp and elevated aspartate transaminase are common in patients with covid-19 and reports from hubei province in china indicate that severe cases are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers including serum d-dimer ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase21 the cytokine profile of severe covid-19 disease is characterized by elevated il-2 il-6 il-7 il-8 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor il-17 tnf and other markers that indicate systemic inflammatory response22 similar to what has been described in macrophage activation syndrome mas or in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh23 24 moreover a retrospective multicenter study of 150 patients performed from wuhan china suggested that among other clinical parameters crp and il-6 levels can be predictors of mortality among 68 patients who died median il-6 level was 114 ngml as opposed to 68 ngml in those 82 who survived p000125 additionally an elevated neutrophil-to-leukocyte ratio was also predictive of poor prognosisin the usa anticipated shortages of key resources including intensive care unit icu beds and mechanical ventilators has led to the implementation of social distancing measures to avoid overloading a medical system that is not prepared to care for an overwhelming number of affected individuals26 while a concerted effort to increase and coordinate the supply of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers as well as mechanical ventilators for patient care is clearly needed27 a complementary approach to decrease the number of patients with severe disease andor decrease the time required in the icu on a ventilator is important as wellbased on emerging information as centers gain more experience treating sars-cov-2-infected patients modulating or inhibiting the il-6 signaling pathway to mitigate the inflammatory response related to covid-19 is an attractive idea15 there is a successful precedent for this strategy as it is almost routinely considered in patients receiving t cell engaging therapies such as car t cells or blinatumomab in these contexts il-6 levels peak at the time of maximal t cell proliferation and patients may develop a crs that can be quite severe and even life-threatening14 administration of il-6 blocking agents such as tocilizumab and siltuximab has been shown to be effective in reversing crs in these patients2830 tocilizumab was approved by the food and drug administration fda for the treatment of crs secondary to car t cell therapy in 201713 and incorporated into the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for the approved car t cell therapy products tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucela word of caution should be exercised in extrapolating the adoptive cell transfer experience using il-6 inhibition to covid-19 as formal comparative analysis of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both situations has not yet been performed initial data from the covid-19 pandemic indicate that cytokine levels are far lower in the context of sars-cov-2 infection than seen in crs25 31
a 21-patient observational study recently performed in china supports the use of tocilizumab to avoid rapid clinical deterioration of individuals with severe pneumonitis and pulmonary complications32 anecdotal cases reported in italy33 also point that tocilizumab may be clinically active in decreasing the magnitude of the inflammatory response associated with covid-19 with rapid improvements observed in critically ill patients even those requiring mechanical ventilation on march 19 2020 the italian medicines agency announced the launch of tocivid-19 an independent phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of pneumonia during covid-19 accrual of 330 patients was reached within 24 hours in the usa a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii clinical trial has recently been approved by the us fda to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab plus standard of care in hospitalized adult patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia nct04320615 a randomized placebo-controlled phase iiiii study evaluating the efficacy of low-dose and high-dose sarilumab another il-6-modulating therapy in hospitalized patients with covid-19 against placebo is also ongoing nct04315298multiple doses of tocilizumab may be necessary for maximal benefit in the chinese study protocol patients received 400 mg once through an intravenous drip up to a maximum of 800 mg with an optimal dose of 8 mgkg body weight in cases of fever within 12 hours after the first administration an additional dose of up to the same amount as the first would be given with two doses as the cumulative upper limit the protocol for the italian trial calls for doses comparable to those commonly used for the management of crs namely 8 mgkg up to a maximum of 800 mg per dose with a second administration of the same dose given after 12 hours if respiratory function has not recovered at discretion of the investigator in preliminary reports from italy meaningful effects have also been observed with the subcutaneous formulation of tocilizumaba key lesson learned from the experience of treating about 500 severe or critical patients in china is the necessity of starting tocilizumab therapy as soon as possible ideally before symptoms start to rapidly deteriorate at the onset of the cytokine storm it is critical to observe high-risk cases patients with persistent fever diffuse lung opacities on ct scans and elevated serum crp and il-6 if cytokine measurements are available because the condition can quickly change from mild to severe early intervention should be strongly consideredwhile establishing new indications for an agent generally requires evaluation in a rigorous often randomized clinical trial the massive impact of this pandemic and the lack of any existing standard-of-care might provide appropriate context to consider off-label use of il-6 inhibition for severely ill patients affected by covid-19 chinas national health commission has recently issued updated treatment guidelines that include the use of tocilizumab in patients with severe disease34
the fda is closely monitoring the medical product supply chain35 and the demand for drugs used to treat patients with covid-19 including but not limited to tocilizumab could surpass the ability to manufacture these agents additionally in some cases access to tocilizumab and sarilumab is limited despite adequate supply for example the study protocol for sarilumab in covid-19-related ards initially excluded individuals who have recently been treated with any other investigational drugs high-dose steroids or cyclophosphamide chemotherapyeffectively preventing numerous patients with cancer and patients receiving immunotherapy from receiving this potentially lifesaving interventionhowever amended exclusion criteria may relax these requirements ongoing and future clinical trials should consider the unique characteristics of oncology patients in their design including inclusion and exclusion criteria in light of the fact that the large immune-suppressed population of patients with cancer may be particularly susceptible to severe complications of covid-1936 in addition although data are not available it is unknown whether pulmonary manifestations of covid-19 may be potentiated or attenuated in oncology patients being treated with immunotherapeutic approaches that themselves can have significant pulmonary toxicity including checkpoint inhibitors and car t cellsalthough tocilizumab and sarilumab are presently the most well-studied anti-il-6 agents in the covid-19 setting numerous agents have been developed to modulate pro-inflammatory signaling at multiple levels in the pathway an immunology-informed approach could identify potential alternatives to tocilizumab and sarilumab broadening the population of patients that may receive treatment to ameliorate the complications of covid-19 and thus flattening the curve for total patient days requiring icu support including mechanical ventilationexpression of il-6 is regulated at multiple levels including chromatin accessibility transcription mrna export post-transcription and translation tnf and il-1 also induce il-6 expression41 coronavirus spike proteins have also been shown to directly promote il-6 production in immune and epithelial cells cultured sars-cov-infected bronchial epithelial cells secrete il-642 and murine macrophages upregulate il-6 and tnf through a nuclear factor-b-dependent pathway in response to viral s protein43
signaling through the il-6 receptor requires assembly at the cell membrane of a complex consisting of il-6 bound to both the 80 kda type 1 cytokine a-receptor subunit il-6r also called cd126 and a 130 kda signal-transducing b-receptor glycoprotein gp130 also called cd130 this trimeric complex homodimerizes leading to receptor activation11 44 expression of the membrane-bound form of il-6r is largely restricted to hepatocytes megakaryocytes and leukocytes45 yet two independent pathways generate a soluble form of the receptor cleavage by membrane metalloproteinases primarily adam10 and adam17 as well as alternative splicing4547 soluble il-6il-6r receptor complex can also bind gp130 activating the downstream signaling cascade the ubiquitous expression of gp130 which has been detected in all human tissues examined underlies the pleiotropic effects of il-6 and the near universal responsiveness to the cytokine across cell types receptor activation through the membrane-bound il-6r versus the soluble form of il-6r are referred to as classical and trans signaling respectively generally classical signaling contributes to regenerative and anti-inflammatory responses whereas trans signaling is pro-inflammatory and plays a role in causing tissue damageligand binding at the il-6r activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades including janus kinase jaksignal transducer and activation of transcription stat pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pi3k pathway of potential importance in the context of covid-19 the activation of jak1 and stat3 kinases by il-6r initiates a pro-inflammatory transcriptional program associated with proliferation differentiation recruitment survival and transformation in t and b cells and myeloid cells11 44 45 an overview of il-6 signal transduction with modes of action of approved il-6-modulatory therapies is illustrated in figure 1while encouraging preliminary results have been observed with il-6 blockade potential constraints on the supply of il-6il-6r-targeting antibodies may limit access to these drugs and the numbers of patients that can benefit in order to expand the spectrum of patients who may access il-6-modulatory therapies alternative targets within the cytokines inflammatory signaling cascade could be consideredil-6 signaling takes place via two mechanisms binding to a higher affinity membrane-bound receptor classical or soluble il-6 receptor trans41 44 both lead to activation of jakstat signaling downstream through jak1 and stat3 on tyrosine phosphorylation on the gp130 receptors cytoplasmic tail jakstat signaling is also activated by other pro-inflammatory cytokines that are observed to be elevated in covid-19 particularly ifn although ifn signaling is primarily via stat1 stats also play important roles in non-canonical cell signaling pathways including activity of non-tyrosine phosphorylated stats mediation of dna methylation regulation of cell adhesion and mitochondrial activity48
small molecules targeting this pathway have been successfully introduced into the clinic and are a therapeutic option in a number of inflammatory processes49 including graft versus host disease and hlh50 51 in xenograft models ruxolitinib was able to prevent crs after car tcell therapy52 importantly a phase iii trial is being initiated to assess ruxolitinib in combination with standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia as a result of sars-cov-2 infection53 additionally a phase ii single-arm study of fedratinib is plannedthe rationale for developing these agents as an option to prevent or treat cytokine release in covid-19 is compelling especially given the relative ease of manufacturing small molecules at scale as compared with biologics the safety profiles of jak inhibitors are generally manageable and predictable including increased risk of viral infections lower gi complications and anemia and leukopenia54 55 because il-6 signaling primarily occurs through jak1 the selectivity of jak inhibitors should be considered before their use for covid-19 additionally jakinibs are oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors54 which may not be easily administeredabsorbed in patients with very severe ongoing systemic inflammatory responsemodulation of il-1 signaling especially through the il-1 isoform could also potentially attenuate the exuberant inflammatory response that accompanies lung pathology in covid-19 upstream of il-6 although serum il-1 has not necessarily correlated with severity of sars-cov-2 disease in published reports its function as a master cytokine elicits large effects with small perturbations5658 il-1 signaling orchestrates the acute phase of response to infections and has also been demonstrated to influence the differentiation of lymphocytes particularly th17 cells of the two isoforms il-1 is predominantly associated with pulmonary pathology in ards59 60 although data on the immunopathology underlying ards in covid-19 are lacking a pro-inflammatory th17 signature has been observed in patients infected with sars-cov-261 as well as in patients with mers-cov62 additionally il-1 has been shown to be a key cytokine driving pro-inflammatory activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with acute lung injury60
the il-1 family of cytokines are major regulators of the acute phase response functioning to control inflammatory reactions in response to pamps and damps released from damaged or infected cells57 63 hundreds of genes are transcriptionally upregulated by il-1 signaling including il-6 il-1-modulating therapies have been fda approved for a number of indications primarily for auto-inflammatory diseases where the primary drivers of pathology are innate immune cells rather than the t cell and bcell compartments64 three il-1-modulating therapies have been approved by the fda and each agent inhibits signaling through a distinct mechanism which may have important implications for their possible use in treating covid-19multiple mechanisms modulate il-1 signaling including the soluble il-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra which is secreted by immune cells epithelial cells and adipocytes65 and the decoy receptor il-1rii which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms and scavenges il-1 with high affinity66 these endogenous factors have formed the basis for several il-1-targeting therapeutics including anakinra a receptor antagonist and rilonacept a receptor trap additionally an anti-il-1 antibody canakinumab has been fda approved for a variety of auto-inflammatory diseasesanakinra is a recombinant form of il-1ra that lacks glycosylation and is modified with the addition of a single methionine residue at the n-terminus although several randomized trials failed to demonstrate statistically significant 28-day survival benefits for il-1r antagonist therapy for sepsis6769 a reanalysis showed profoundly improved outcomes among the subset of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatobiliary dysfunction hallmarks of secondary mas70 anakinra has also proven effective and gained fda approval for the treatment of a variety of autoinflammatory disorders including caps as well as rheumatoid arthritis56 63 anakinra is short-acting with a plasma half-life of roughly 46 hours71
anecdotal evidence has emerged that anakinra effectively modulates late-onset tocilizumab-refractory crs with clinical features similar to hlhmas secondary to car t cell therapy72 initial experience from the northern italian sars-cov-2 outbreak however has indicated that anakinra monotherapy did not provide clinical benefit when administered to patients with severe ards33 it is possible that multiple mechanisms need to be targeted as cytokine profiles from patients with covid-19 demonstrate marked elevation of multiple factors beyond il-1 including il-6 il-17 tnf and ifn an ongoing clinical trial is evaluating anakinra in combination with the ifn inhibitor emapalumab for severe ards in covid-19 nct04324021the overall safety profile of anti-il-1 therapies is acceptable as with any cytokine modulator il-1 blockade carries increased risk of bacterial infections but after many years of clinical experience and tens of thousands of patients treated it has become apparent that opportunistic infections are highly rare with anakinra treatment even among people at high risk for tuberculosis reactivation of note anti-il-1 therapy is associated with a reduction in circulating neutrophil counts58 which may be clinically significant given that a high nlr neutrophil to leukocyte ratio is predictive of poor prognosis in covid-19 evidence for improved outcomes after using il-1 modulating therapies for crs is lacking and variable the timing of il-r1 antagonist administration may be critical and limited benefit may be obtained with treatment of already-established ards targeting il-1 directly either by reducing its effective concentration via a receptor trap or monoclonal antibody may also be impactfulligands and receptors of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily play central roles in regulation of the immune system and tissue homeostasis although tnf signaling is vital for antipathogen immune responses and is protective in a variety of viral infections including smallpox73 west nile virus74 and influenza75 elevated levels of tnf have been linked to pulmonary pathology in acute lung injury elevated tnf is observed in both plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with ards and expression of the cytokine directly leads to increased endothelial permeability along with impaired alveolar fluid clearance due to downregulation of epithelial sodium channels76 77 elevated serum tnf has been reported to correlate with severe disease in covid-198 and the sars-cov s protein has been demonstrated to induce tnf and il-6 upregulation in murine macrophages43
the primary sources of tnf are stimulated monocytes fibroblasts and endothelial cells although macrophages t cells b lymphocytes granulocytes smooth muscle cells eosinophils chondrocytes osteoblasts and mast cells all produce tnf as well7779 tnf is synthesized as a membrane-protein and cleaved by adam17 to release its soluble form both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of tnf are active although their affinities to tnf-family receptors varies tnf signaling is complex and may involve as many as 29 different tumor necrosis factor receptor tnfr family members in particular tnfr1 is widely expressed as is the case for il-6 this broad-based expression gives rise to pleiotropic systemic effectsmultiple tnf inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and some have demonstrated benefit in animal models of acute lung injury and respiratory distress80 these results have not borne out in humans however as anti-tnf therapy failed to protect patients from sepsis-induced acute lung injury81 82 and did not improve outcomes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease83 preliminary reports from china indicate that anti-tnf antibody offers limited benefit for patients with sars-cov-2 infections with established ards84 although modulating the pathway through other targets or at different timepoints may be more efficacious in the oncology setting the anti-tnf antibody infliximab is commonly used for the management of immune-related adverse events secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy additionally success has been reported with the use of the tnf receptor trap etanercept for the treatment of crs secondary to car t cell therapy85 and in mas86 but no prospective large-scale trials have demonstrated efficacy for tnf modulation in the setting of viral cytokine storm adverse effects of concern for anti-tnf therapy include dampened cell-mediated immune responses all of the approved agents carry black box warning labels for increased risk of serious life-threatening opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections and patients with latent tuberculosis should not receive these therapiesifn is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an essential role in multiple phases of immune and inflammatory responses the ifn family of proteins encompasses three distinct classes with variable direct antiviral and immune-modulatory activities87 the ifn receptor is expressed on both malignant and non-malignant cell populations88
on receptor binding ifn initiates a signaling cascade through jak1 and jak2 activation which leads to stat1 homodimerization and nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of a wide array of ifn-inducible genes through the gas enhancer element88 89 ifn has been implicated as an important downstream effector cytokine in the antitumor immune response and in the immune response to various infectious pathogens including viruses90 although protective in the context of antiviral host defense ifn also has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and in various autoimmune diseases91 92 anti-ifn therapy has been investigated in hlh rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis crohns disease and psoriasis91 93
elevated serum ifn has been associated with severe acute respiratory distress in covid-198 21 36 94 additionally ifn enhances il-6 production in monocytes95 and an ifn-related cytokine storm syndrome was reported in some patients during the 2003 sars coronavirus outbreak96 anti-ifn antibodies have been demonstrated to alleviate acute lung injury induced by severe h1n1 influenza infection in murine models97 and a trial of the human monoclonal anti-ifn emapalumab in combination with the il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra for covid-19 is ongoing98
anti-interferon therapy is approved in the us for the treatment of primary hlh in the pivotal trial for the approval of emapalumab for hlh the most commonly reported adverse events included infections hypertension infusion reactions and fever99
alveolar macrophages can play a central role in the inflammatory pathology of ards through the release of a wide array of bioactive factors that damage or induce cell death in the lung epithelium such as proteases reactive oxygen species eicosanoids phospholipids and cytokines including il-1 il-6 and tnf77 100 one key cytokine that regulates macrophage number and function is granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor gm-csf a monomeric glycoprotein secreted by macrophages t cells mast cells natural killer cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts gm-csf is upstream of il-6 and induces an inflammatory transcriptional program through jakstat signaling101 inactivation of gm-csf in car t cells dramatically lowers il-6 and il-8 secretion102 and therapeutic inhibition of gm-csf reduces car t-cell-associated crs in mouse models103
initial evidence from a study of 52 patients with covid-19 reported from wuhan china elevated levels of circulating gm-csf were associated with worse clinical outcomes18 22 additionally analysis of peripheral blood samples from 33 patients with covid-19 with pneumonia found increased numbers of pathogenic th1 cells gm-csf ifn and inflammatory monocytes cd14 cd16 with high expression of il-6 in patients admitted to the icu as compared with non-critical patients104 in early april 2020 several studies evaluating anti-gm-csf antibodies for covid-19 treatment were initiated in rapid succession including trials of lenzilumab105 tjm-2106 gimsilumab107 and namilumab one anti-gm-csf antibody lenzilumab received emergency investigational new drug approval for compassionate use in patients with covid-19 although the safety profiles of anti-gm-csf antibodies have been acceptable in phase i and phase ii trials it is important to note the potential for lung toxicities and pneumonia with these agents101
il-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine it is produced by th17 cells on stimulation with il-23 the il-17il-23 axis stimulates the secretion of cytokines know to mediate inflammation including il-6 and il-6 in the presence of tgf- skews nave cd4 t cells toward the th17 phenotype108 il-17il-23 signaling has been postulated to mediate cross-talk between the innate and the adaptive immune system109 a characteristic th17 signature has been noted in patients with covid-19 ards10 and modulation of il-17 signaling through the jakstat inhibitor fedratinib has been proposed although this indication is currently speculative61 clinically the use of agents that modulate this axis have been mostly used in the treatment of chronic conditions such as psoriasis109 and the most frequently observed adverse events have been nasopharyngitis upper respiratory tract inflammation and injection site reactions110 although these agents have the potential to dampen il-6 production and signaling the use of il-17il-23 modulators in conditions such as crs has not yet been widely testedthe covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 highlights an urgent need for all healthcare stakeholders including government organizations academic centers community centers philanthropic organizations advocates pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to develop a coordinated and flexible approach to increase the availability of resourcesmodulationinhibition of the severe inflammatory state in patients with covid-19 characterized by elaboration of various inflammatory mediators including il-6 is a potentially important strategy to treat andor limit severe covid-19 pulmonary complications including ards if successful across the broader population of patients with covid-19 strategies such as anti-il-6-directed therapy could reduce the needs for icu support and mechanical ventilation and ultimately decrease mortalityrandomized phase iii trials are currently evaluating the efficacy of anti-il-6-directed agents including tocilizumab and sarilumab as well as the jakstat inhibitor ruxolitinib and will provide definitive data regarding the use of these agents in patients with covid-19 as described here other anti-il-6 agents including small molecule inhibitors of il-6 signaling and other anticytokine inhibitors may warrant investigation particularly in the setting of overwhelming demand for agents to modulate the inflammatory state in patients with covid-19 ongoing studies are also investigating other strategies such as the use of eculizumab a monoclonal antibody that targets complement protein c5 approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or some tlr7-8 inhibitors such as m5049 in all likelihood a combinatorial approach encompassing antivirals such as remdesivir and potentially cytokine-modulatory therapies may be needed to successfully treat the infection with sars-cov-2 and the full spectrum of associated complicationsthe us fda has announced a new program ctap coronavirus treatment acceleration program to expedite drug development for covid-19 while this is encouraging news and the appropriate way to proceed from a drug development perspective the healthcare community and more importantly the affected patients need effective treatments without delay especially as the numbers of cases in the usa and several countries around the world continue to grow exponentially consideration also should be given to focus efforts on rapidly expanding the ability of clinicians and clinical investigators to access investigational anti-il-6 agents in particular for those agents where phase ii andor phase ii studies have been completed and acceptable safety has been demonstrated use of cytokine-modulatory agents during these extreme circumstances may additionally warrant consideration and definitive prospective randomized trials also should be conducted with all due hasteuntil the sars outbreak 2002 during which coronaviruses cov showcased their potential for epidemic spread and significant pathogenicity in humans they were mainly known as causes of mild respiratory and gastrointestinal disease 1 over the last two decades three novel betacoronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and sars-cov2 have crossed the species barrier and caused significant outbreaks characterized by high case-fatality rates in humans 2 3 4  the latest addition to human pathogenic coronaviruses hcovs is sars-cov2 the cause of covid-19 at the time of submission of this review sars-cov2 has infected over 26 million people worldwide and claimed 185000 lives threatening many more httpsgisanddatamapsarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlbda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 in the following epidemiological and clinical features of covid-19 pathophysiological mechanisms and already available and future therapeutic options will be discussed based on limited evidence available and extrapolation from related viral diseasethe first hcovs were described in 1966 e229-cov and oc43-cov 56 they are part of a group of currently four known seasonal hcovs shcov that also includes hku1-cov and nl63-cov which were only discovered in 2005 78 all shcovs are globally endemic and frequently cause common colds accounting for 2-18 of all respiratory tract infections 9 10 11 12 13 by their fourth birthday 75 of children show antibodies directed against at least one of the shcovs 1415 anti-shcovs antibodies provide some cross-immunity and antibody-mediated protection against infection by other species within the group 16 while their overall pathogenic potential is comparatively low in the immunocompromised infants the elderly and those with pre-existing pulmonary disorders shcovs can cause severe respiratory or sepsis-like presentations 17 18 19 20 21 oc43 displays some neurotropism and can cause demyelination and cns infections in vulnerable patient groups 2223 while estimates of their contribution to annual respiratory illness vary shcovs remain asymptomatic in approximately 50 of cases 24 25 26this is in stark contrast to the clinical presentation encountered in infections with so-called novel coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov2 which are associated with morbidity and case-fatality ratios that far exceed the ones in shcovsthe sars pandemic of 20023 originated in foshan guangdong province china and spread to south east asia europe and north america 27 containment was declared by the end of 2003 with no re-emergence reported since overall 8096 probable cases caused 774 deaths resulting in a mortality rate of 96 httpswwwwhointcsrsarsen mortality strongly correlated with age approaching 7 for those younger and 55 for those older than 60 years 28 health care workers in contact with sars patients demonstrated a very low seroconversion rate of 2 in asymptomatic individuals less than 5 of all affected were children and post-containment seroprevalence among children considered high-risk for significant exposure was extremely low this suggests that subclinical sars among children had not occurred 29 30 31 approximately 20 of sars patients required intensive care support for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards half of who died within the following 28 days 32the severe clinical phenotype of sars was replicated during the emergence of mers in 2012 which continues to circulate albeit to a lesser extent 36 to date 2494 cases of mers have occurred worldwide presenting as severe pneumonia and resulting in respiratory and multiorgan failure with a case-fatality-ratio of 35-45 37 individuals with comorbidities males and the immunocompromised are considered at particularly high riskin both previous novel coronavirus outbreaks the severity of the clinical manifestation has puzzled clinicians common features included massive inflammatory cell infiltration of the lungs resulting in acute lung injury ali and ards highly elevated inflammatory markers in the serum evidence of monocytemacrophage activation activated coagulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles 33 34 35 36 37 38 this soon led to the implication of the host response as an important factor in this fulminant disease process 38 animal models of sars suggest that lung inflammation intensifies after viral clearance peaking as late as 14 days after infection 39 and similar observations were made in human sars patients this suggests that clinical deterioration later in the disease course was likely not due to uncontrolled viral replication but rather uncontrolled immune responses and associated damage 4041similar descriptions of clinical presentations in covid-19 are now emerging presenting features of cough and fever subacutely progress to respiratory distress and acute respiratory distress sydrome ards in 8-19 of patients with the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities especially cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus chronic pulmonary disorders or renal disease especially at risk httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirusbollettinoreport-covid-201924marzoengpdf 42 43 44 45 it is estimated that about 14 of covid-19 patients develop respiratory symptoms requiring supplemental oxygen and approximately 5 develop a need for mechanical ventilation 44 45 46 the cdc reports an overall case-fatality rate of 23 though higher at 148 in patients over 80 years of age and 49 among the critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation 46the pulmonary pathology in covid-19 is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and evidence of intravascular thrombosis monocytes macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrate the pulmonary interstitium 4748 the severe pulmonary inflammatory infiltrate of pulmonary tissue impedes alveolar gas exchange in addition one fifth of hospitalized patients develop significant cardiovascular morbidity characterized by troponin rise tachyarrhythmias and thromboembolic events which is strongly associated with mortality risk 49 50 51 common features of covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care level support therefore are severe pneumonia with hypoxic respiratory failure of subacute onset evolving into ards with a clinical picture characterized by fevers lymphopenia highly elevated c-reactive protein proinflammatory cytokines serum ferritin and d-dimers histopathological evidence of a prominent pulmonary infitrate dominated by monocytes and macrophages vasculitis and hypercoagulability is seen 5253based on current knowledge clinical pictures disease pathology and progression of sars-cov2 infections are similar causing significant morbidity and mortality that may be associated with hyperinflammatory responses in a subset of patientscoronaviruses are highly prevalent animal pathogens with a wide host range overall thousands of species of coronaviruses are known 5455 currently seven covs are recognized as human pathogens 1 the family of coronaviridae is divided into two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae coronavirinae include the genera alpha- betacoronaviruses infecting only mammals and gamma- and deltacoronaviruses which infect both mammals and birds human covs e229 and nl63 are human pathogenic alpha- while oc43 and hku1 and all novel covs including sars-cov2 are betacoronaviruses the potential of toroviruses to cause disease is humans is unknown httpstalkictvonlineorgictv-reportsictv9threportpositive-sense-rna-viruses-2011wposrnaviruses222coronaviridae coronaviruses covs are large enveloped viruses with a single-stranded nonsegmented positive sense rna genome that spans approximately 30 kilobases making it the largest known genome of any rna virus 56 being rna viruses covs readily evolve by mutation and homologous and non-homologous recombination which expands their host range and facilitates crossing of species barriers extensive animal reservoirs especially among bats genetic recombination among covs and their plasticity in terms of receptor use renders covs highly effective at host switching sometimes across wide taxonomic distances 5758all hcovs are thought to be zoonoses novel coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov2 are comparatively poorly adapted to humans which affects their pathogenic potential 5559 their genomic proximity to animal covs may allow for ongoing interspecies recombination events as observed in mers 60 mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov2 have a natural reservoir in bats infection of humans likely occurred through intermediate hosts including dromedary camels mers the masked palm civet sars and the pangolin sars-cov2 61 as wild palm civets do not carry sars-cov it must be assumed that the proximity of animals in markets facilitates recombination events and the emergence of novel viruses that may be pathogenic in humans 6263coronaviruses are spherical in shape their most prominent feature are club-like projections on the virus surface which are referred to as spikes the virus membrane contains four structural components the spike s envelope e membrane m and nucelocapsid n protein 56 fig 1
 for sars-cov and sars-cov2 the s protein is the primary determinant for host tropism and pathogenicity it is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and therefore of great interest in terms of immunological response and vaccine design 64 the spike structure is formed by homotrimers of s-glycoproteins each of which consists of two subunits whereby s1 forms the part involved in receptor recognition and s2 is highly conserved anchors the protein in the viral membrane and facilitates viral fusion 65 66 67 s1 contains a hypervariable loop which differs greatly between betacoronaviruses on both size and sequence viral entry requires the proteolysis of the s protein in two locations a process that utilizes host proteases and results in irreversible conformational changes of the s protein 6467 some anti-sars-cov antibodies in humans mimic receptor engagement thus modeling conformational s protein changes upon antigen-antibody interaction 67 the amino acid sequence of receptor binding sites of sars-cov2 is 74 homologous to that of sars- cov suggesting similar or even identical cell entry mechanisms for both viruses 68nl63 sars-cov and sars-cov2 all use the transmembrane angiotensin converting enzyme ace2 as host receptor whereas mers cov utilizes dipetidylpeptidase-4 dpp4 65 both receptors are transmembrane ectoenzymes that are highly conserved among mammals thus facilitating interspecies transfer however their enzymatic activity in itself is not necessary for successful binding and fusion 69 70 71binding affinity of the s protein of sars-cov2 and ace2 is high high sequence and conformational conservation of the s protein observed across sars-cov2 and sars-cov allows for some level of cross neutralization of the two viruses in vitro 6468hemagglutinin residues enhance binding by allowing interactions with sialic acid residues on host cell surfaces betacoronaviruses feature yet another structural protein hemagglutinin-esterase he which binds sialic acid on cell surfaces 72 fig 1 this may enhance the virus ability to bind and invade host cell surfaces and may constitute a virulence factor in novel hcovswhile data on sars-cov2 are still sparse aforementioned parallels with sars-cov and mers-cov may for now allow extrapolation of knowledge to understand how sars-cov2 escapes the hosts immune response notably sars-cov2 shares almost 80 rna sequence homology with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov 75 with sars-cov2 exhibiting additional genomic regions when compared to sars-cov in particular the viral spike protein which binds to the host cell receptor is 20-30 amino acids longer than sars-cov and other closely related coronaviruses 75 thus it is possible even likely that sars-cov2 uses similar immune evasion strategies to other coronaviruses but additional as yet undiscovered mechanisms may also be utilized by sars-cov2 76as mentioned above sars-cov and sars-cov2 both use ace2 as their host cell receptor to establish infection fig 2a 77 ace2 is expressed in almost all organs in the body ace2 has been shown to be highly expressed on surfactant producing type 2 alveolar cells and on ciliated and goblet cells in the airways these cells likely provide a portal of entry for the virus in humans 78 79 80 high ace2 expression is also observed on the intestinal epithelium 81 furthermore ace2 is expressed on cardiac cells and vascular endothelia which may explain cardiovascular complications in some patients 53 for sars-cov infection of immune cells including monocytesmacrophages and t cells has been observed it is not clear to date whether and to what extent sars-cov-2 can also infect these cell types ace2 is also but at lower levels and not ubiquitously expressed on monocytes and macrophages so this may also provide an entry mechanism into immune cells for sars-cov-2 however other receptors andor phagocytosis of virus containing immune complexes may also be involved fig 1b 768283the host response and clearance of viral infections heavily relies on type i interferon t1ifn expression 84 expression of t1ifn and down-stream signals modulate cell responses and reprogram cells into an anti-viral state subsequently promoting infection control and pathogen clearance 85 as a first step immune cells sense viral infection through identification of virus derived pattern associated molecular patterns pamps such as viral rna these bind to and activate pattern recognition receptors prrs inon immune cells and result in immune cell activation fig 2 rnas viruses such as sars-cov sars-cov2 and mers-cov are detected by endosomal rna prrs including toll-like receptors tlr-3 and 7 andor cytoplasmic rna sensors namely retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 mda5 fig 2 usually tlr37 activation results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factors nfb and irf3 while rig-1mda5 activation result in activation of irf3 in turn this triggers increased expression of t1ifn through irf3 and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 tnf- through nfb 7686 in this context t1ifn and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines promote their own expression through auto-amplification t1ifn activate the ifn- receptor complex ifnar which results in the phosphorylationactivation of stat family transcription factors 1 and 2 fig 2 while il-1 il-6 and tnf receptor activation feeds into pro-inflammatory cytokine expression though the transcription factor nfb fig 2 85 86 87 activation and priming of innate and adaptive immune responses should result in pathogen clearance and recoveryhowever in a proportion of infected individuals sars-cov mers-cov and likely sars-cov2 evade immune system recognition through suppression of these mechanisms a phenomenon associated with more severe disease and poorer prognosis 388889fig 2 red symbols sars-cov has been shown to alter ubiquitination and degradation of rna sensors rig-i and mda5 it inhibits activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein mavs which are essential for the activation and nuclear translocation of irf3 in response to cytoplasmic rna sensor activation furthermore sars-cov and likely sars-cov2 inhibit the tnf receptor-associated factors traf 3 and 6 which are central for the induction of irf-37 in response to tlr37 andor rig-i and mda-5 ligation as well as nfb signalling pathways which are usually activated in response to tlr37 ligation or cytokine receptor signaling 88 lastly novel coronaviruses can counteract t1ifn signaling through inhibition of stat family transcription factor phosphorylation 86 taken together suppression of innate immune mechanisms in infected epithelial cells and to some extent infected monocytesmacrophages allow novel coronaviruses to proliferate without triggering the innate anti-viral response machinery of these cellshowever at a later stage infected cells undergo cell death and release virus particles together with intracellular components that trigger innate inflammatory mechanisms through their recognition by prrs inon innate immune cells as a result of this innate immune activation and resultant expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 tnf- etc adaptive immune cells become involved in the hosts defense against viral infections t lymphocytes play a central role in this anti-viral response including cd4 t cell derived cytokines cd8 t cell mediated cytotoxicity and b cell activation resulting in antibody production novel coronaviruses may also partially escape these mechanisms through the induction of t cell apoptosis 90 however lymphocytes may also become depleted due to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by not infected innate immune cells that become recruited to the lungs and trigger hyper-inflammation seen during the development of a cytokine storm 91while symptoms of covid-19 disease may be sometimes only slightly milder in comparison to infections with sars-cov or mers-cov several key pathogen-associated and clinical features of disease are similar and we can extrapolate knowledge from what is already known about the pathophysiology of sars and mers in covid-19 as in sars or mers several key findings were associated with poor outcomes in cohort studies and suggest hyper-inflammation may be linked to more severe disease three early studies from wuhan linked cytopenia andor significantly elevated inflammatory parameters with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes one study involving 99 patients reported neutrophilia 38 lymphopenia 35 and increased systemic inflammatory proteins il-6 in 52 and crp in 84 as common symptoms in covid-19 disease 72 another study involving 41 individuals linked severe disease culminating in icu admission and mortality with neutrophilia and lymphopenia 4 the third study reported significant leukopenia 118 lymphopenia 776 thrombopenia 412 anemia 482 hypofibrinogenemia 224 and hypo-albuminemia 788 in a cohort of 85 patients who died from covid-19 8392 these observations are in line with findings in severe or lethal cases of sars and mers in which increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages are present in the airways 8393 other groups reported severe clinical phenotypes and icu dependency of patients to be associated with increased plasma levels of innate chemokines specifically c-x-c motif chemokine 10 cxcl10interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip-10 chemokine c-c motif ligand 2 ccl2monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1accl3 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf- 2 this indeed is similar to the situation reported in sars and mers in which uncontrolled inflammation centrally contributes to poor outcomes 94 95 96though seemingly contradictory to mechanisms of immune evasion discussed above enhanced innate immune activation including increased t1ifn il-1 il-6 and tnf- expression centrally contributes to morbidity and mortality in covid-19 mers and sars one possible explanation is the induction of endothelial and vascular cell damage and cell death as a result of viral replication virus-induced inflammatory cell death including necrosis or pyroptosis result in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression uninfected immune cell recruitment and activation 97 mice infected with sars-cov exhibit excessive t1ifn secretion from myeloid cells in infected tissues indeed immune evasion through the suppression of anti-viral responses and t1ifn expression in respiratory epithelia results in high viral loads 38 from this it is hypothesized that not infected monocytesmacrophages and neutrophils recruited to the site of infection exhibit strong and poorly controlled inflammatory responses resulting in tissue damage and systemic inflammation both of which contribute to morbidity and mortality 53fig 3
another factor thought to contribute to organ damage and poor outcomes is the early production of neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses antibody-dependent enhancement ade is a phenomenon shown to contribute to damage accrual during viral infections it has been shown to promote cellular uptake of virus particles bound in immune complexes through their binding to fc receptors fcr this may contribute to aforementioned persistent viral replication in immune cells including newly infected antigen-presenting cells but also immune complex mediated inflammatory responses fig 2 fig 3 fig 4
 that contribute to tissue and organ damage including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 98 99 100 indeed a subset of covid-19 patients reportedly develop vasculitic lesions blood vessel occlusion and infarctions histopathologic reports from tissue sections suggests features associated with immune complex mediated vasculitis including infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes within and around blood vessels wall thickening and focal hemorrhage 53101 102 103as is true for a number of systemic autoimmuneinflammatory conditions uncontrolled activation of immune responses is likely not limited to the innate mechanisms as a result of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the presence of nuclear antigens from cell and tissue damage adaptive immune cells may become activated and trigger a second wave of inflammation potentially in those patients who deteriorate after 7-10 days of infection indeed adaptive immune cells namely t lymphocytes which are observed in lung tissue sections of covid-19 patients with ards andor cytokine storm may drive inflammation at later disease stages similar mechanisms have been reported in influenza and other viral infections 104105 overall severely ill covid-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm exhibit lymphopenia and sometimes atrophy of the lymphatic tissues namely lymph nodes and spleen 51106107 this is in line with reports in primary and secondary forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh and associated cytokine storm which result in inflammatory cell death and hypo-cellularity of lymphatic organs 108 109 110poor outcomes are associated with age indeed children appear to contract sars-cov2 and usually do not develop severe symptoms or complications this is surprising as children are prone to viral infections including severe manifestations more than 75 of children get exposed to seasonal coronaviruses before their 4th birthday and seroconverts however antibody titres wane over time most obvious in those over 60 years 110 this may reduce immune response to sars-cov2 in the elderly as limited cross-reactivity between anti-seasonal coronavirus and anti-sars antibodies exists but also contribute to increased inflammation and complications immunological recall effects exist as anti-seasonal coronavirus titres increase in sera of convalescent sars patients 111 which may influence immune pathology as mentioned above antibody-bound virions can enter susceptible cells such as macrophages through fc receptor ligation in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement ade 112 in other viral infections eg dengue fever ade allows immune cell infection and reduces type i ifn dependent antiviral responses while promoting pro-inflammatory il-6 and tnf- expression 113114 furthermore massive recall antibody production in individuals with a history of exposure to seasonal coronaviruses but waning titres such as the elderly can result in immune complex deposition and promote inflammation and damage including immune complex vasculitis 110another age-dependent disease mechanism may be associated with live vaccinations eg measles or bcg vaccines protect beyond their target antigen through induction of innate immune mechanisms termed non-specific heterologous effects individuals who received bcg vaccination produce increased levels of pro-inflammatory il-1 and tnf- in response to s aureus or candida spp and bcg vaccinated infants exhibit reduced infection-related mortality 115 however heterologous immune responses to unrelated antigens may also contrite to inflammation-related complications frequently adults exhibit memory t cells that are specific to antigens they were never exposed to and cross-reactive memory t cells can narrow the t cell response by favoring high affinity clones indeed limited memory t cell repertoires are a feature of immune senescence and associated with disease progression and t cell mediated damage in other viral infections such as virus hepatitis and infective mononucleosis 116as mentioned above ace2 acts as transmembrane cellular receptor for sars-cov2 allowing cell infection 117 variable ace2 expression patterns affect disease susceptibility between tissues eg respiratory epithelia vs immune cells but potentially also between individuals men vs women children vs adults thereby determining disease progression and outcomes recently it has been suggested that ace2 expression is highest in children and young women that its expression decreases with age and is lowest in individuals with chronic disease including diabetes and hypertension inversely correlating with risk for severe disease and unfavorable outcomes 118 while ace2 facilitates viral entry into cells it also plays a role in controlling infection and inflammation ace2 is part of the ace2angiotensin- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7mas system as it counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of the angiotensin-2 it catalyzes angiotensin-2 processing into angiotensin-1-7 which counteracts vasoconstriction modulates leukocyte migration cytokine expression and fibrogenic pathways 119 thus ace2 contributes to limiting tissue inflammation while favoring repair mechanisms furthermore high ace2 expression may be of benefit as sars-cov2 virus particles may compete with angiotensin-2 for cell surface binding sites and cellular uptake thus relatively increased ace2 expression may explain why children and young adults especially young women are relatively protected from covid19 and associated complicationstaken together novel coronaviruses such as sars-cov2 may effectively suppress early t1ifn responses which contributes to uncontrolled virus replication resulting in delayed and potentially increased cytokine responses at later stages early and sufficient control of virus replication and pathogen clearance may be altered in individuals at risk such as the elderly patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome etc 7475 healthy children and young people on the other hand may effectively control viral load at early stages of infection and less frequently develop severe disease and life-threatening complications lastly early antibody production may result in integration of viable virus into immune cells and increased viral replication resulting in immune complex mediated pathology which may contribute to pathology in young patients with no obvious risk factors 100medical use of chloroquine dates back decades its phosphate and sulphate derivatives are administered as antimalarials and hydroxychloroquine is widely used as immunomodulatory agent in systemic lupus erythematosus in addition chloroquine has antiviral activity against influenza chikungunya virus seasonal covs and sars 120 121 122 123 as for these viruses cell entry and replication of sars-cov2 depends on ph-dependent internalization by endocytosis and lysosomal fusion fig 2 itself being a weak base hydroxychloroquine follows the cellular ph gradient and accumulates in the acid environment of endolysosomes and other acidic cell organelles thereby alkalinizing endosomes in addition hydroxychloroquine interferes with the terminal glycosylation of ace2 interfering with virus binding 123antiviral activity of chloroquine derivatives against sars-cov2 was identified in vitro early on 124 based on this the drug was rapidly introduced into clinical use and preliminary reports suggested improved viral clearance and clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients receiving a 10-days course of hydroxychloroquine 125 a small french pilot study randomizing 36 patients with covid-19 suggested accelerated viral clearance in patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 126 however others have challenged results and found no benefit in either disease outcome or viral clearance 127  disappointingly the largest also retrospective study to date assessing hydroxychloroquine on its own or in combination with azithromycin found no benefit but indeed an increased mortality risk among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine 128 a study exploring chloroquine diphosphate in two dosing regimens was forced to terminate early for concerns over increased mortality in the high dose arm the authors conclude that treatment with high dose chloroquine for 10 days is not sufficiently safe and should no longer be used in severe sars-cov2 patients 129immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine are well established and may enhance its therapeutic effect in covid-19 complicated by macrophage activation and cytokine storm 130 alkalization of endosomes reduces proteolysis chemotaxis phagocytosis receptor recycling and interferes with processing of epitopes displayed by antigen-presenting cells 131 this overall contributes to decreased production of il-1 il-6 and prostaglandins and alters intracellular calcium and tlr dependent signaling furthermore preventing the acidification of lysosomes hydroxychloroquine impairs cellular autophagy a critical step for innate and adaptive immunity activation 132 finally hydroxychloroquine has antithrombotic effects which may be beneficial in covid-19 where inflammatory stimuli and endothelial injury activate coagulation and promote micro-thrombus formation 133134while generally deemed safe when administered at correct dosing and under close monitoring the therapeutic range of chloroquine and its derivatives is narrow side effects include conduction defects cardiomyopathy retinopathy and hypoglycemia 135136as mentioned above synergistic effects of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov2 have been observed in vitro which appeared to translate into clinical practice 126137138 interestingly azithromycin is also a weak base and also accumulates in endosomes with an alkalinizing effect at least equivalent to hydroxychloroquine in addition to its antimicrobial properties azithromycin is sometimes used for its immunomodulatory properties especially in patients with chronic pulmonary disorders azithromycin polarizes macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory m2 phenotype and inhibits pro-inflammatory stat1 and nfb signaling pathways 139140 in the context of anti-inflammatory effects it is of particular interest that azithromycin is used in patients requiring intensive care for non-covid-19 related ards and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and shorter time to extubation 141 142 143adverse cardiac effects and proarrhythmogenic properties of hydroxychloroquine especially in combination with macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin deserves particular mention 144 hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and to a lesser extent lopinavir have been associated with prolongation of the qtc interval and increase the risk for tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death careful consideration of patient risk profile pre-treatment ecg assessment and monitoring of pharmacokinetics fluid and electrolyte status and polypharmacy are essential for the management of critically ill covid 19 patients 145nucleoside analogues are explored as treatment options for covid-19 candidates include favipiravir geldesivir ribavirin and remdesivir with the latter having received the most attention remdesivir a prodrug to adenosine 146 was originally developed for the treatment of hemorrhagic fever viruses namely ebola ebov and marburg viruses but underperformed in ebov treatment compared to antibody strategies both have antiviral in vitro activity in mers and sars 147148 competing with atp and substituting for adenosine during rna synthesis remdesivir inhibits the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp 149 human mitochondrial rdrp show significantly lower affinity to remdesivir as compared to their viral counterparts mitigating side effects for the host cell 150the presence of cov-specific proof-reading exonucleases capable of removing phosphorylated remdesivir from the rna chain could present a potential for development of resistance remdesivir treatment for murine hepatitis virus in a mouse model showed that while conferring resistance the trade-off in viral fitness was of a magnitude sufficient to significantly attenuate viral pathogenicity 147 the timing of administration in animal models of ebov and mers was crucial for remdesivirs efficacy with most benefit achieved when given early 148 this is in keeping with aforementioned phases of the disease with highest virus replication rates early in disease and host-mediated damage through immune responses at later stages a recent case report however highlights persisting benefits also if late administration 151remdesivir underwent in vitro testing at the wuhan virus research institute early during the sars-cov2 outbreak 124 and was identified as potently inhibiting viral infection in cell cultures at concentrations readily achievable in vivo it was first used successfully in a covid-19 patient in january 2020 152 since remdesivir has been employed on a compassionate use basis and results for its use as a 10 day course reported for 53 patients with sars-cov2 34 of whom required ecmo 4 or mechanical ventilation 30 at baseline 153 significantly reducing mortality assessment in randomized controlled trials is needed two of which had been in place in china for the treatment of moderate to severe covid-19 with recruitment terminated in march following declaration of containment nct04257656 nct04252664 trials are currently ongoing in europe and north america with effective reduction of pulmonary viral load in animal models an acceptable safety profile in ebola patients and a small group of covid-19 patients remdesivir may offer an effective and viable future treatment optionthe combination of lopinavir and ritonavir lpvr better known by tradenames aluvia and kaletra is a frequently used antiretroviral treatment for hiv combining two protease inhibitors limits otherwise extensive cyp3a4 activation and drug metabolism thereby resulting in much improved bioavailability of lpv 154 proteases are critical for viral replication as they cleave both structural and functional proteins from precursor viral polypeptides fig 5
 thus enabling maturation into an infectious virion particle lpvr is mainly metabolized in the liver and thus pre-existing hepatic impairment is considered a relative contraindication 154in sars lpvr in combination with ribavirin was associated with a significant reduction in unfavorable outcomes ards and death as compared to ribavirin alone 24 versus 288 155 similar observations were made in a retrospective cohort study involving 1000 sars patients where lpvr was associated with significantly reduced mortality and need for intubation 73156 and it is currently being investigated by the who for use in mers patients in an ongoing randomized clinical trial early use of lpvr was recommended based on aforementioned pathophysiological considerations rather than clinical datain view of the in vitro activity against both sars and mers and the limited clinical data available for lpvr in treatment of critically ill sars-cov2 patients a randomized open-label trial was undertaken in wuhan china 157 it recruited almost 200 covid-19 patients randomized to either standard treatment or added lpvr for 14 days whilst confirming safety of lpvr use in covid-19 no significant differences were seen between groups in relation to survival or time to recovery thus leaving the authors question whether a combination of lpvr with a nucleoside analogue such as ribavirin would have resulted in improved outcomes trials exploring the therapeutic potential for lpvr are currentlyongoing httpswwwremapcaporgcoronavirus
httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncovsolidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatmentsas ace2 has been identified as a key molecule for cell invasion see above its therapeutic blockade to control disease and aid viral clearance has been suggested 158 however unselective ace blockade with currently available agents may be problematic as it could alter angiotensin-1 through -7 which have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties 159 indeed depletion of ace2 by sars-cov2 may potentially contribute to increased disease activity in critically ill covid-19 patients in animal studies ace2 protects from ards 160 161 162 while angiotensin ii contributes to pulmonary pathology including edema and fibrosis 163 thus accumulation of angiotensin ii in the absence of ace2 may aggravate disease and organ damage consequently ace2 induction has recently been suggested for covid-19 treatment 85159164165  however effects of ace2 may vary between tissues and environments intestinal epithelia produce much higher levels of ace2 than bronchial epithelia which is notable as not all patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms and when they do symptoms tend to be mild and some patients remain sars-cov2 positive in stool samples long after respiratory specimen became negative 78166 167 168  based on these observations one could suggest that high-level ace2 expression such as that seen in the intestine and in contrast to the respiratory tract or in children and young people as compared to individuals at risk the elderly especially when obese or chronically ill may protect from inflammation and tissue damage however additional factors such as the immunological micro-environment or regionally variable microbiomes may significantly affect virus uptake replication andor clearance thus the exact roles of ace2 in the context of covid-19 remains to be unveiled and may be complexthe administration of recombinant human ace2 to neutralize virions prior to their attachment to the host cells is also being explored as a therapeutic option in the future in the attempt of exploiting the anti-inflammatory effect of the ace2 ang- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7mas axis in non-covid-19 related ards first pilot trials in humans have been published 169 and whilst data supporting its efficacy as an ards treatment option remains outstanding the treatment appeared safe and was well toleratedas mentioned above sars-cov2 effective inhibits the expression of type 1 interferons 38 resulting tissue damage and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from infected monocytesmacrophages promote excessive immune cell infiltration and cytokine responses 114 more recently also abortive infection in t lymphocytes with sars-cov2 has been suggested 170 but detailed characterization remains outstanding altogether unaltered virus replication in the presence of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokine expression can explain ards and cytokine storms in covid-19 overcoming immune evasion and enhancing antiviral activity may be a logical treatment strategyin sars and mers patients recombinant interferons have been used with varying success while antiviral activity of recombinant ifn-2a ifn-2b ifn-1a and ifn-1b was shown in vitro for mers sars and sars cov2 neither mortality nor viral clearance were affected by recombinant interferons in mers 171172 however the time of administration may be critical as suggested by a mouse model of ifn i treatment for mers 173 therefore human patients may have received treatment too late to be fully effectiveconvalescent plasma ie plasma from individuals following covid-19 resolution and rich in immunoglobulins directed against sars-cov2 is being entertained as possible treatment option 174175 anecdotal use in sars mers ebola and influenza patients supports its use as a neutralizing andor immunomodulatory agent 176177 however a larger randomized controlled assessment of hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin use for severe influenza 178179 and ebola 180 showed this intervention to not be superior to placebo similarly rigorously evaluated data for its use in coronaviral infections is lacking - not only for its use in sars-cov2 181 and a feasibility study exploring its use in mers found that in many survivors antibody titres were not high enough thus further limiting the donor pool 182 variable dosing issues surrounding donor recruitment in times of rapidly increasing patient numbers and drawbacks regarding safety of widespread use of human blood products all limit the availability and utility as widely available treatment optionfinally in viruses that are subject to ade such as sears-cov2 see above by non-neutralizing antibodies the option of plasma therapy also holds significant risks this complication has recently been exemplified by anti-zika virus antibodies enhancing dengue virus infection 183 thus the administration of hyperimmuneconvalescent plasma may carry the risk of significant illness upon future exposure to related or yet-to-emerge coronavirusesas mentioned above current management of covid-19 is mainly supportive and approved treatments based on scientific evidence are not available main causes of death include ards and cytokine storm syndrome also referred to as macrophage activation syndrome mas or secondary hemophagocytic histiocytosis hlh 7492106107 indeed ards occurs in 50 of patients with cytokine storm syndrome 184 considering impressively rapid development of systemic and pulmonary inflammation in a subset of patients with covid-19 early identification and control of derailed immune responses is of utmost importance based on data from chinese cohorts markers associated with cytokine storm in other conditions may be predictive of poor outcomes in covid-19 which include leukopenia lymphopenia thrombopenia hypoalbuminemia significantly elevated crp and il-6 hyperfibringenemia and prolongedthrombin time 74185186 however this needs to be tested prospectively and other more sensitive and specific biomarker may be identifiedfirst data on cytokine storm syndrome and its catastrophic effects on tissues and organs was generated in patients with familial hlh in which mutations in associated genes including prf1 unc13d stx1 stxp2 lyst xiap and others result in systemic inflammation and if not controlled death 109 standard treatment in these conditions include high-dose corticosteroids dexamethasone the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine a chemotherapy with etoposide and ultimately stem cell transplantation 187 while the underlying molecular causes of familial hlh are different to covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome clinical fevers organomegaly in some patients and laboratory features cytopenias massively elevated inflammatory parameters including crp esr and ferritin hypalbuminemia hyperfibrinogenaemia etc and consequences tissue and organ damage death overlap furthermore based on observations in the h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 a significant proportion of individuals developing disease-associated secondary cytokine storm syndrome may have mutations in one or more genes associated with familial hlh in h1n1 36 of fatalities were associated with mutations in genes associated with the perforin pathway 188thus clinical management of covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome may to some extent be informed by what we know from familial hlh however treatment of covid-19 associated cytokine storm should be more targeted and not include cytotoxic drugs andor stem cell transplantation as it is secondary to an infection which will hopefully be cleared
corticosteroids are used in primary and secondary forms of hlh and can control inflammation in ards 91189 first preliminary data from sars and covid-19 suggest that high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on lung injury 190191 instead high-dose corticosteroids are associated with complications in other forms of ards including avascular osteonecrosis 192 short courses of low- or medium-dose corticosteroids however have been suggested to be of benefit in a chinese cohort of critically ill covid-19 patients 193 taken together the limited data on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in ards are anecdotal and not conclusive controlled trials do not exist as their use is associated with widely variable effects on pathogen clearance and evidence for their efficacy is lacking high-dose corticosteroids cannot be generally recommended for the treatment of covid-19 194 and the use of low dose regimens must be trialed in formal and controlled studies
intravenous immunoglobulins ivig are used in systemic autoimmuneinflammatory conditions to control systemic inflammation through several mechanisms including the capture of activated complement factors blockade of fc receptors inhibition of b and t lymphocyte differentiation and activation neutralisation of cytokines and antibodies etc 195 as mentioned above immune complexes containing viable virus may mediate infection activate fc receptors andor be deposited in tissues and organs lastly resulting in pro-inflammatory responses 196 of note ards and cytokine storm in sars coincided with serum conversion in a majority of patients supporting these arguments furthermore patients who ultimately died seroconverted significantly earlier when compared to individuals who recovered from infection 40197 based on these observations ivig may be of benefit to some patients by inhibiting fc receptors and limiting antibody-dependent enhancement discussed above furthermore aforementioned classical anti-inflammatory effects may limit systemic inflammation and anti-pathogen properties may be supportive in cases with bacterial superinfection or in patients who previously cleared sars-cov2 and developed specific antibodies 186198
the blockade of cytokines associated with hyper-inflammation during covid-19 is a more targeted approach when compared to the use of systemic corticosteroids and is a promising therapeutic avenue indeed first anecdotal reports suggest efficacy at least in some patientsthe il-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab has been used successfully in patients with secondary cytokine storm syndrome 199 including covid-19 200201 several studies have started or are about to be launched investigating efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with secondary cytokine storm syndrome in covid-19 including chictr2000029765 in china 202the recombinant il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra was originally developed to control cytokine storm and associated tissue damage in sepsis patients 203 subsequently anakinra has successfully been used in patients with cytokine storm syndrome secondary to autoimmuneinflammatory 204205 infectious or malignant disease 206 anakinra may have significant potential at controlling hyper-inflammation in severe covid-19 disease considering the absence of severe side-effects in aforementioned sepsis trials 203 and reduced frequency of neutropenia and hepatotoxicity when compared to tocilizumab currently anakinra is being trialled in a randomised placebo-controlled study in children and adults with covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome in china nct02780583 91
inhibition of janus kinases jak with small molecules is a relatively new concept used in systemic autoimmuneinflammatory conditions jaks are involved in cytokine receptor signaling including but not limited to the il-6 receptor as well as type 1 and type 2 ifn receptors 91207 they mediate the phosphorylation of stat family transcription factors which are in turn involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression thus jak inhibitors efficiently limit cytokine expression and may aid in controlling cytokine storms 91 however jaks are also centrally involved in controlling the expression of t1ifn which plays a key role in limiting virus replication and initiating pathogen clearance 208 at least in the initial stages of covid-19 disease when virus replication and infection may be limited to the epithelium sars-cov2 likely limits t1ifn expression see above therefore additional inhibition of jak through small molecules may be counterproductive as they further limit pathogen containment and clearance and may cause unforeseeable complications thus jak inhibition may not be the most suitable target-directed treatment option in covid-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome andor ards to our knowledge at least two clinical trials are ongoing to test efficacy and safety of jak inhibitors in severe covid-19 chictr2000030170 chictr2000029580the previously discussed mechanisms of infection immune evasion and dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses cause significant concern for and among patients on systemic immune modulating treatments including patients with malignant or systemic autoimmuneinflammatory diseases based on previous coronavirus outbreaks sars and mers and first small observational studies in covid-19 cohorts risk factors for poor outcomes include old age presence of comorbidities diabetes metabolic syndrome etc obesity male sex coronary heart disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and kidney disease 209 of note immune modulation or suppression was not identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis in china or italy 186210 while this could generally be considered good news immune suppression and associated altered immune function may predispose patients to infection and potentially prolong virus spreading furthermore as covid-19 is associated with lymphopenia patients receiving immune modulating treatment may be prone to secondary infections such as bacterial pneumoniaas discussed above some immune modulating drugs may protect from viral infections antimalarial drugs chloroquine hydroxychloroquine may inhibit tissue infection and viral replication 53103 furthermore immune modulating medications anti-malarial drugs classical as well as biologic dmards and others may prevent or control cytokine storm syndromesuncontrolled discontinuation of immune modulating treatment may result in disease flares in autoimmuneinflammatory conditions organ rejection in transplant patients or reoccurrence of malignancies which on top of obvious effects may also all increase the risk for viral infection thus national and international societies including the acr and eular recommend continuation of treatment in the absence of symptoms and alterations to existing treatment regimens only in agreement with and under close monitoring by the responsible clinical service 211212 international collaboration is needed and under way to safely assess individual risk in these vulnerable patient groups until reliable data is available close clinical monitoring and social distancing should be prioritizedas immunity does not exist and a significant proportion of humans develop severe disease the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 is a threat to millions globally sars-cov2 has the capacity to escape innate immune responses which allows the pathogen to produce large copy numbers in primarily infected tissues usually airway epithelia through the infection of innate immune cells andor the recruitment of uninfected cells from the circulation to the primary site of infection massive immune reactions induce hyperinflammation that can result in a cytokine storm and life-threatening complications we are only beginning to understand host factors such as differential expression of cell surface proteins that may determine infection risk disease presentation and outcomes unveiling tissue and stage specific factors contributing to pathology will result in new effective and disease stage specific therapeutic approaches that control virus replication while limiting inflammatory damage until vaccinations become availablethe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a novel viral illness that is precipitated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-21 as of april 19 2020 covid-19 has been diagnosed in nearly 23 million people worldwide has led to over 150000 deaths and has been deemed a pandemic by the world health organization2in its most severe form covid-19 is characterized by a cytokine release syndrome crs that progresses to multisystem organ failure and death34 recent reports also demonstrate that patients are predisposed to thromboembolic disease through both the direct and indirect effects of covid-1915 although some patients require early intensive care the majority experience a more benign clinical course a certain subset of patients however mount a large inflammatory response despite initially appearing well6 early monitoring of inflammatory markers is being used to help predict which patients will eventually necessitate higher levels of care7a similar hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable response leading to multisystem organ failure is also seen in patients after severe polytrauma810 a less severe initial traumatic insult first hit also has the capacity to produce the same systemic response if it is followed by persistent physiologic derangements or subsequent proinflammatory interventions second hit81112 damage control orthopaedics is often used in polytrauma patients to minimize the second hit and prevent subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome ards1315although a trauma is often thought of as the first hit in the two-hit theory other hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states such as in covid-19 may also act as part of the first hit in patients with orthopaedic injuries this may be especially relevant in patients who appear well but have developed a large inflammatory response16 indeed recent evidence suggests alarmingly high intensive care unit icu admission and mortality rates after elective surgery on asymptomatic patients in the incubation period of covid-191617 however little is known about how orthopaedic trauma and subsequent fracture fixation modulates the inflammatory response in patients with covid-19 a better understanding of this relationship can inform the development of evidence-based management strategies in these patients and limit admissions to overcrowded icusto demonstrate and further define these developing theories on the coagulative and inflammatory risks associated with the surgical treatment of trauma patients with covid-19 we will present an unexpected outcome on such a patient at our institution the purpose of this case presentation is to drive the subsequent discussion and literature review on the management of patients with covid-19 presenting with orthopaedic traumaa woman in her 80s with a history of dementia and myeloproliferative disorder presented with an isolated extra-articular fracture of the left distal femur fig 1 and acute nonocclusive deep vein thromboses dvts of the left popliteal and gastrocnemius veins on presentation she was afebrile and denied any respiratory symptoms her preoperative peripheral capillary oxygen saturation was between 90 and 97 on room air and at times requiring 2 l of supplemental oxygen physical examination revealed that the patient not to be in respiratory distress with clear lung sounds admission chest radiograph is shown in fig 2 demonstrating no major consolidation or infiltrates laboratory evaluation showed no leukocytosis anemia or thrombocytosisgiven that she was a nursing home resident with known exposure to multiple covid-19positive residents she was tested for the disease and found to be positive a multidisciplinary approach was taken for the care of this patient including orthopaedics internal medicine infectious disease anesthesia and vascular surgery she was deemed an asymptomatic covid patient with no concern for her respiratory functiona shared decision was made to proceed with surgical fixation to allow for improved mobility healing and pain controlwithin 12 hours of initial presentation the patient underwent reamed locked retrograde intramedullary nailing of her left distal femur fracture intramedullary nailing was chosen because it is the senior authors preferred treatment for distal third femur fractures and the intramedullary implant would assist in preventing medialization of the distal segment preoperative templating estimated an isthmus of 1617 mm plan was for placement of a 13-mm diameter nail the patient tolerated the early steps of the procedure well during passage of the 14-mm diameter reamer and obtaining cortical chatter the patient became acutely hypoxic and hypotensive requiring maximal fio2 pf ratio 102 and increasing vasopressor requirements after reaming the patient improved marginally to the point where she was amenable to intramedullary nail placement after placement of the intramedullary nail a heparin drip was immediately initiated for presumed intraoperative pulmonary embolism she remained intubated at the completion of the procedure and was transferred to the iculaboratory values obtained immediately postoperatively are provided in table 1 along with postoperative laboratory trends the patients initial leukocytosis and elevated troponin brain natriuretic peptide fibrinogen d dimer ferritin and c-reactive protein crp are noted the patients pf ratio at that time declined to 88 pao2 88 mm hg fio2 100 indicating severe respiratory failureupon arrival to the icu a bedside echocardiogram was performed revealing the right ventricular dilation and septal flattening indicative of right heart strain computed tomography pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a nonocclusive right main pulmonary artery embolus with right heart strain left upper lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolus and mosaic ground glass attenuation of the lung parenchyma concerning for viral pneumonia and fat embolism subsequent pulmonary angiography redemonstrated the right-sided lobar embolus and elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure right-sided percutaneous pulmonary suction thrombectomy was performed blood clot and fat emboli were removed with no significant residual lobar or segmental pulmonary emboli on follow-up angiogram fig 3 the patients relatively small embolic burden did not correlate with her clinical presentation of respiratory failure with right heart strain in addition the patients hemodynamic response and lack of improvement after embolectomy was not characteristic of other experiences with similar volumes of thrombus or fat extractionthe patient required inotropic support for the first 48 hours postoperatively she was successfully extubated on postoperative day 9 and transferred out of intensive care on postoperative day 13the clinical presentation of covid-19 resembles viral pneumonia with severe cases rapidly progressing to ards19 crs is implicit in the pathogenesis of these severe cases of covid-19 although the full immunologic response elicited by covid-19 is still not fully elucidated current reports indicate elevations of a distinct set of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin il-2 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf-320 treatment protocols for severe covid-19 are aimed at attenuating this life-threatening inflammation such as with the il-6inhibiting agent tocilizumab320 these treatments are currently reserved for the population of patients with a declining clinical status paired with worsening inflammatory markers3 the overwhelming inflammatory response in these patients is believed to cause diffuse alveolar damage and endothelial dysfunction the dysfunctional endothelium thus becomes prothrombotic which predisposes patients to microangiopathy and microthrombi520 the clinical implications of this are profound as the presence of vasculitis and prothrombotic state can make patients vulnerable to pulmonary embolism which can exacerbate hypoxemia caused by ards5 this is a crucial point for consideration in asymptomatic covid patients presenting with orthopaedic trauma as we hypothesize that subclinical levels of systemic inflammation from covid-19 may predispose to adverse outcomes this theory is supported by a recent report out of wuhan that has demonstrated alarmingly high mortality and icu admission rates after elective surgery on asymptomatic patients in the incubation period of covid-1917in addition to these microvascular aberrations significant coagulation abnormalities appear to be associated with the crs and implicated in disease progression16192122 these hemostatic derangements include increased clot strength increased fibrinogen and fibrin degradation product levels elevated d-dimer levels decreased prothrombin time and international normalized ratio times as well as patterns of disseminated intravascular coagulation2123 such changes also predispose these patients to thrombotic events such as venous thromboembolism much like the previous zoonotic virus outbreaks sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov124 this is convincingly demonstrated by an amounting number of reported cases of young patients with large-vessel strokes as a presenting feature of covid-1925 the most commonly observed hemostatic abnormality in these patients is elevated d-dimer levels 1 gml which have specifically been associated with an increased risk of icu admission mechanical intubation requirement and death126 for these reasons use of empiric anticoagulation at therapeutic doses on patients with highly elevated d-dimer levels is being implemented by some intensivists and is currently supported by some experts in the american college of cardiology1 in fact early reports have indicated decreased mortality in severe covid-19 patients with coagulopathy who were treated with anticoagulation22 it is possible that the coagulation abnormalities associated with this disease may have contributed to the development of the acute dvts in our patient and that the intraoperative initiation of a heparin drip may have attenuated the effects of pulmonary emboli these coagulative effects of covid-19 and proposed benefits of anticoagulative therapies are important to consider when treating orthopaedic trauma patientsin covid patients presenting with orthopaedic trauma the hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state caused by the virus may also have significant implications on blunt injury pathophysiology after severe blunt trauma damaged tissue induces a local and systemic inflammatory response mediated by the release of the cytokines tnf- il-1 and most importantly il-6 the severity of this inflammatory response and subsequent clinical course is determined by the following 3 factors 1 the degree of the initial injury first hit 2 the individuals amounted biological response and 3 the type of treatment second hit10 these 3 factors contribute toward an amounting inflammatory cascade that increases until a patients biologic reserve is overwhelmed and a tipping point is reached fig 410 the tipping point refers to a state of clinical instability associated with microvascular injury interstitial edema hemodynamic lability and end-organ failure10 the first hit can be reliably quantified in traumatized patients by measuring il-6 levels which have been shown to be correlated with increased incidence of multiple organ failure and patient survival27 emerging studies on covid-19 have similarly observed correlations between il-6 levels and disease severity which suggests a potential mutual inflammatory pathway with that of trauma patients although stemming from a distinct inciting event2428 therefore covid-19 may decrease a trauma patients biologic reserve before reaching a physiologic tipping point fig 4 in other words covid-19 may unfavorably amplify the first hit by contributing a significant biologic response before the injury whether the patient is symptomatic or not this may manifest clinically as decreased cardiopulmonary capacity in these patients albeit to variable extents based on the severity of their disease this hypothesis is supported by a recent case series demonstrating a 40 mortality rate in symptomatic covid fracture patients16among the 3 aforementioned factors contributing toward the tipping point the treatment is the sole modifiable factor in particular long bone fractures treated with intramedullary fixation are at risk for fat embolization in addition to the inflammatory response from this second hit1829 these events have been demonstrated to result in pulmonary insult changes in markers of coagulation and at times cardiovascular strain the coagulative effects are due to simultaneous activation of both the fibrinolytic and coagulation pathways2930 and the inflammatory effects are mediated by il-630 as for the cardiopulmonary effects of intramedullary fixation intraoperative measurements on humans using transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiopulmonary monitoring have demonstrated consistent pulmonary arterial pressure elevations and in severe casessignificant hypoxemia and right heart strain during guide-wire insertion and canal reaming2931 these findings are mostly attributable to fat emboli which occur in approximately 90 of trauma patients but are only clinically apparent in 1531 in addition ards is a potential consequence of the inflammatory response from intramedullary fixation of femur fractures1132in the aforementioned study on elective surgery outcomes of asymptomatic covid patients they reported a 441 15 of 34 icu admission rate postoperatively which is significantly higher than the reported 261 in hospitalized nonsurgical covid-19 patients17 furthermore the reported 205 7 of 34 mortality rate was significantly higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 23 in nonsurgical covid-19 patients33 patients in that study also developed covid symptoms on average 26 days postoperatively and the median time from symptom onset to the development of dyspnea was 35 days in comparison a previous study on nonsurgical covid-19 patients reported that the median time for symptom onset was 80 days19 the difference is alarming the most common postsurgical complication in the icu-admitted patients in that study was ards and over half of these patients received subsequent immunosuppressive medications to attenuate the diseases inflammatory response the authors of this study reached a similar conclusion as ours that surgical stress occurring during the incubation period of sars-cov-2 infection exacerbates disease progression and severity17another recent study out of china by mi et al16 reported on 10 covid fracture patients 3 of which did not have any signs or symptoms of the disease three patients underwent surgical fixation of their fractures and the rest were treated nonoperatively because of their declining clinical status they reported that 4 of these 10 patients died at 8 and 14 days after admission abnormal d-dimer levels were present in all patients elevated crp in 90 of patients but normal prothrombin times in 70 of patients16 the authors of this study also concluded that the characteristics and prognosis of covid-19 patients with fractures tend to be more severe than those reported for covid patients without fractures16most recently catellani et al34 published their outcomes in italy on the treatment of proximal femoral fragility fractures in patients with covid-19 they reported on 16 symptomatic covid patients with confirmed viral pneumonia on chest computed tomography three of these patients died of respiratory failure before surgery the remaining 13 series underwent surgical stabilization of their fractures with either an intramedullary nail or hemiarthroplasty nine of these patients were stable postoperatively whereas 4 patients died of respiratory failure on the first third and seventh day postoperatively34 the authors of this study concluded that surgical stabilization of proximal femoral fractures resulted in stabilization of respiratory parameters but did mention that elderly patients with comorbidities and symptomatic covid-19 are not eligible for orthopaedic surgery34the current environment in the health care system is unprecedented there are little to no data to guide us in our decision making when treating patients with covid-19 the disease manifests in ways we would have never been able to predict the level of cytokine response hypercoagulability and pulmonary dysfunction associated with the covid-19 virus may predispose to a catastrophic second hit after even low-energy trauma this is in line with the previous hypotheses that postsurgical complications are more accurately predicted by assessing objective data covering several physiological systems coagulation acidbase changes soft-tissue damage etc compared with using data from a single physiologic system eg acidemia35 regarding our patient we hypothesize that covid-19 may have lowered her physiologic reserves to withstand the relatively low intraoperative embolus burden interestingly not only did the clot burden fail to correlate with the patients physiologic status after nailing she did not show any significant improvement after embolectomy of the thrombus and fat indicating another disease process such as ardsthe following precautions may be appropriate when dealing with unprecedented challenges associated with covid-19 patients presenting with orthopaedic trauma injuriestest for covid-19 in all patients with unknown disease status upon admissionconsider obtaining baseline inflammatory markers including il-6 if available d dimer and crp which may aid in surgical decision making and prognosisconsider obtaining lower extremity duplex ultrasound in all patients testing positive for covid-19 and high-risk fracturesfor patients with confirmed proximal dvt consider either aggressive intraoperative anticoagulation or placement of an inferior vena cava filter preoperativelyconsider alternative orthopaedic trauma management strategies eg damage control orthopaedics and nonoperative treatment in patients with severe cases of symptomatic covid-19 even in low-energy traumaconsider surgical treatments that avoid canal instrumentationconsider avoiding excessive reaming if intramedullary fixation is performedmounting evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of covid-19 involves a hyperinflammatory response predisposing patients to thromboembolic disease and acute respiratory distress in the setting of severe blunt trauma damaged tissues induce a local and systemic inflammatory response through similar pathways to covid-19 as such patients with covid-19 sustaining orthopaedic trauma injuries may have an amplified response to the traumatic insult because of their baseline hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states careful consideration and riskbenefit analysis including preoperative evaluation of systemic inflammation and respiratory status is paramount in patients with covid-19 presenting with orthopaedic trauma injuriessince the beginning of december 2019 the novel sars-cov-2 outbreak is spreading globally posing critical challenges for the medical community 1 so far covid-19 seems to be more contagious and more deadly than most strains of seasonal influenza in fact without containment measures the basic reproduction number r0 of sars-cov-2 has been estimated in the range of 22 and 57 meaning one case may infect between two and five other persons while for seasonal influenza this number is reportedly around 13 23 fatality rates for covid-19 differ significantly in magnitude across countries discrepancies most likely depend among other factors on the frequency of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients as well as on the testing strategy adopted in different settings which may result in a significant proportion of undiagnosed cases an accurate estimate of the overall infection fatality is still very difficult to calculate recent estimates based on aggregate data from china adjusted for demography and under-ascertainment bias suggest that the overall case fatality rate of covid-19 could be close to 138 4 however taking into account the ratio of asymptomatic cases support infection fatality ratios hovering 0407 5 these figures are lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers which had case fatality rates around 10 and 36 respectively 6 yet they seem to exceed those of most severe influenza strains which have case fatality rates averaging 01 the reasons why some patients progress to severe disease while others only manifest with mild or no symptoms remain to be elucidated beside the direct cytopathic effect of the virus the host hyper-inflammatory response has clearly emerged as a key factor in determining disease severity and mortalityas clinical and epidemiologic information on sars-cov-2 infection have increased a better knowledge on the burden of severe disease and clinical risk factors associated with disease progression have emerged older age male gender and pre-existing chronic conditions such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease have been observed to be the most significant risk factors among patients with covid-19 in china and europe 789 in the united states disproportionately higher rates of hospitalization and death have been reported among african-american and hispanic groups and may be explained by differences in economic and social conditions of ethnic minorities in specific contexts nevertheless genetic contribution to different clinical outcomes cannot be excluded 10achieving a better understanding of the interaction between sars-cov-2 and the host immune system as well as of the immune pathology driving disease progression may therefore provide opportunities for treatment interventions and vaccine developmentboth sars-cov and sars-cov-2 enter human cells exploiting the link with membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 protein which is widely expressed in many cells across the body including type ii alveolar cells at2 upper airways cells endothelial cells myocardial cells proximal tubule cells of the kidney ileum and esophagus epithelial cells and bladder urothelial cells 1314151617coronavirus spike s glycoprotein binds to ace2 initiating viral entry into host cells of note the affinity of sars-cov-2 s protein for ace2 is higher than that of sars-cov 181920 whether higher density of ace2 may facilitate or protect alveolar cells from the infection is still debated 21 binding of the s1 subunit of the s protein to ace2 is followed by the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes mediated by the s2 subunit of s protein and requires s protein priming by cellular proteases for this purpose sars-cov-2 mainly uses a serine protease transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 and the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin b and l catbl 16 notably tmprss2 is androgen-regulated and this may be related to higher prevalence of both infection and severe disease in males 2223 after viral entry into cells expression of membrane ace2 is downregulated because of endocytosis of the receptor together with the virus this event results in reduced metabolization and increased levels of angiotensin ii in lung tissues and increased stimulation of the type 1 angiotensin ii receptor atr1 which mediates angiotensin ii-induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury 2425 notably injection of sars-cov s protein in mice is sufficient to worsen acute lung failure and this effect is reduced by renin-angiotensin pathway blockage with the at1r inhibitor losartan 26 all these observations may explain why sars-cov-2 primarily causes pneumonia with vascular injury differently from influenzavirus and suggest that higher availability of membrane ace2 may be protective furthermore activation of atr1 receptor directly upregulates nf-kb as well as a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 adam17 on cell surface adam17 in turn cleaves membrane tnf to soluble tnf and processes membrane il-6r to the soluble sil-6r which allows il6 responsiveness by many tissues through il6 trans-signaling leading to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stat3 activation and the amplification of nuclear factor kappa b nf-kb activation 27 once infected cells are directly affected by sars-cov-2 replicative cycle which is therefore a cytopathic virus causing direct cell death and resulting in increased inflammatory response 28 notably sars-cov has been shown to cause caspase-1-mediated cell death pyroptosis a highly inflammatory form of cell death via the activation of the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 nlrp3 mediated by the viral 3a protein which acts as a potassium ion channel viroporin resulting in inflammasome activation 29besides alveolar cells ace2 is widely expressed also on endothelial cells macrophages heart intestine and kidney and this may explain the involvement of these cells in severe cases of covid-19 193031 the ability of sars-cov-2 to infect enterocytes has been demonstrated in human small intestinal organoids and this may explain the relative frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in covid-19 32 furthermore it has been suggested that sars-cov2 may persist longer in the digestive system and this may be a cause of protracted form of disease requiring readmission to hospital in some patients due to gastroenteritis symptoms with persistence of viral rna in stools after resolution of respiratory symptoms 33recent findings support a primary role of endothelial cell infection and resulting endotheliitis in covid-19 pathogenesis which may lead to vasculopathy coagulopathy and multiple organ injury 31 endothelial injury may be due to direct viral infection of endothelial cells as well as to endothelial activation and apoptosis from inflammatory cytokines especially tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf 34 according to recent unpublished data from autopsies it has been argued that vascular damage with peripheral lung microthrombi may be an early phenomenon directly linked to viral infection rather than to the inflammatory reaction a significant incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thromboembolism has been also reported this led to the suggestion to introduce prophylactic heparin in hospitalized patients with covid-19 3536overall the occurrence of pulmonary vascular microthrombosis and of vascular dysregulation due to angiotensin system abnormalities may account for the observation of severe hypoxemia despite high compliance of the lung differently to what occurs in most other types of interstitial pneumonia these findings are likely associated with an increase of dead space ventilation ventilation of poorly perfused lung a defective hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with areas not ventilated but perfused shunt and may also partly explain the efficacy of proning in patients with respiratory failure 37recent findings demonstrated that sars-cov-2 also infect immune cells causing activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines 38 direct infection of lymphocytes via ace2 binding had been previously demonstrated for sars-cov 39 following this observation it has been said that sars-cov could be considered halfway between a common respiratory virus and a lymphotropic virus such as hiv 40 sars-cov-2 seems unable to replicate in lymphocytes and it is uncertain whether direct lymphocyte infection can contribute to the lymphopenia associated with severe covid-19 indeed lymphopenia may just be due to apoptosis as a part of a multilinear cytopenia induced by hypercytokinemia or by overt hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 741 the initial response to coronaviruses infection by the innate immune system plays a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the infection the sensing of foreign nucleic acids is the first step in the pathway to an effective immune response leading to viral clearance eukaryotic cells have several sensors so-called pattern-recognition receptors prrs that are activated by foreign pathogen-derived material in the endosomal compartment toll-like receptor 3 tlr3 recognizes double-stranded rna derived by viral replication while tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 recognize respectively single-stranded rna tlr78 and dna tlr9 sequences typical of virus and containing ucpg motifs in the cytoplasm the two rna sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 mda5 recognize double-stranded rna intermediates produced during viral replication activation of cellular sensors elicits the production of type i ifns and other inflammatory cytokines which act on the infected cells and on the neighboring cells making them more resistant to the entry of other virus particles and act on resident dendritic cells dcs and macrophages to promote the activation and organization of the antiviral response 42 the redundancy of cell sensors is not surprising given that viruses may develop evasion strategies for example sars-cov can modify the features of its immunostimulatory rna lowering the recognition by mda5 4344 moreover sars-cov can also dampen ifn-i production by distinct mechanisms including degradation of interferon ifn pathway components by a papain-like protease 4546 as well as ifn response by inhibition of stat1 transport into the nucleus in response to interferon signaling 47 similarly mers cov suppresses rig-i-induced type i and type iii ifn production interfering with tripartite motif containing 25 trim25-mediated rig-i ubiquitination 48 several evidences have shown that ifn-i production in the very early phase of the infection is a crucial step affecting the course of the disease in an animal model of mers-cov infection the timing of the ifn-i response directly influences the disease outcome as early administration of ifn-i protects mice from lethal infection while delayed treatment does not prevent the development of fatal pneumonia and cytokine storm 49 thus it is logical to assume that a properly functioning pathway from the sensing of viral nucleic acids to ifn production is a prerequisite for an effective antiviral response the importance of this pathway is also reinforced by the observation that germline defects in proteins involved in the ifn cascade are associated with mendelian susceptibility to severe viral infections 50 the autocrine effects of ifn include changes of cell membrane composition with increased content of 25-hydroxycholesterol 5152 and expression of a set of antiviral genes such as interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 ifitm3 that reduce further cell infection by viral particles 53 of note ifitm3 mutations have been associated with severe influenza cases during h1n109 pandemic 54 the paracrine effect of ifns involves an antiproliferative activity mediated by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinases cdks and the activation of several immune cells such as dendritic cells dcs that mature migrate and increase antigen presentation natural killer cells nk that increase their cytotoxic activity and ifn- secretion and t and b lymphocytes inducing th1 polarization and immunoglobulin-secreting cells differentiation notably interferon response has been found defective in 19 of severely ill subjects thus supporting a possible pharmacological administration of the cytokine in this subset 55nk cells have multiple antiviral functions upon activation by various stimuli including ifn-i they provide rapid killing of virus-infected cells before specific cd8 t cells expansion and later modulate the adaptive immune response 56 while nk cells are important in immune defense against dna-virus like epstein barr virus or cytomegalovirus their relevance is less defined against rna viruses and there is no clear data about their role in coronaviruses immune response nk cell levels in blood from severe sars-cov or sars-cov-2 patients were lower than normal but this may not necessarily reflect a shortage of nk in lungs 5758 of note a trial with third party nk cells to treat covid-19 is ongoing in chinatissue dcs can be activated by cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns damps or can be directly infected by sars-cov 59 in the case of sars-cov it has been shown that the virus fails to actively replicate in dcs which in turn produce large amounts of inflammatory ifns 60 and chemokines 59 within hours after infection dcs migrate to the draining lymph nodes and present viral antigens to virus-specific t cells triggering adaptive immune response 61 however it has been hypothesized that sars-cov may be able to modulate the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by dcs among its mechanisms to evade immune response 62 macrophages and neutrophils are also part of the inflammatory reaction and the balance of their activation may be a crucial point in determining the fate of the infection macrophages are thought to be among the major players in the production of inflammatory cytokines associated with covid-19 including il-6 tnf- and il-1 moreover it has been hypothesized that infected macrophages expressing ace2 could migrate to blood and spleen contributing to the spread of the infection 63 liao et al analyzing cells from bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with covid-19 showed that severe disease course was associated with a prevalence of monocyte-derived macrophages that overwhelmed tissue resident macrophages and produced large amounts of cytokines involved in the inflammatory storm typical of the disease conversely in milder cases tissue resident macrophages contributed to the expansion of clonal cd8 t cells 64 interestingly in a mouse model of sars-cov infection removal of inflammatory macrophages protected the animals from lethal infection without affecting viral load 65 whereas removal of neutrophils led to no improvement in viability on the contrary removal of neutrophils in a mouse model of severe influenza hindered viral clearance in this model ablation of il-6 accounted for a similar effect since the cytokine has antiapoptotic effects on neutrophils 66 although this model may not apply to coronavirus infection it raises the possibility that an excessive inhibition of il-6 could delay the clearance of the virus also in sars at this point the large majority of infected subjects can recover from the infection owing to a balanced immune response in figure 1a in the steps from lymphocyte activation vi to production of anti-inflammatory mediators x we try hypothesizing a possible process leading to resolution of the infection based on analogies to what we learnt from other viral infections recruitment of antiviral t cells is thought to occur mainly in draining peribronchial lymph nodes where dcs bring viral antigens the process of recruitment and expansion of lymphocytes is likely to start some days after virus infection and to take about a week in normal conditions a crucial aspect to contrast the spreading of the infection is the availability of a large t cell repertoire with several distinct precursors that can be clonally expanded indeed rapid expansion of sufficient t cells to contrast the virus spreading is particularly important as during the kinetics of the infection the coronaviruses tend to dampen t-cell response by several distinct mechanisms including inhibition of dcs functions 67 several studies suggested that the wider t cell repertoire in children and young adults account for a prompt and effective response to novel viruses for which there is no acquired specific memory to be recalled 68 of note in sars-cov and mers-cov infection airway cd4 t cells directed against a shared epitope between the two viruses mediated a protective memory immunity which was dependent on the production of ifn- 69 the development of a shared vaccine based on common conserved epitopes has been proposed as a strategy to fight emerging respiratory coronaviruses virus-specific cd4 t cells sustain the activation of cytotoxic cd8 t cells which together with nk have particular importance in the killing of infected cells moreover virus-specific cd4 t cells promote the production of antiviral antibodies by b cellsin most cases antiviral antibodies are considered able to block further spreading of the virus to other organs and to provide prompt defense against new challenges with the same virus moreover administration of hyperimmune plasma from recovered patients has been proposed to treat patients with severe covid-19 70 however the development of protective antibodies is not strictly required to overcome the disease since two subjects with congenital agammaglobulinemia spontaneously recovered from covid-19 pneumonia 71 in contrast subjects with common variable immunodeficiency who have defective but not absent b-cell function tend to develop more severe disease requiring multiple drug treatment 72 this may suggest that b cells may also be implied in severe covid-19 pathogenesis non-protective antiviral antibodies may also be produced which could even enhance viral entry in cells expressing the fc receptor for immunoglobulins 73 this phenomenon named ade antibody dependent enhancement of viral entry has been well described for other viruses and represents matter of concern for the development of vaccines for example engineering of sars-cov antigens has been proposed to select peptides inducing blocking antibodies but not ade 74 so far though ade has not been demonstrated for sars-cov-2 interestingly ade has been demonstrated to occur both in subjects previously exposed to the same virus and in subjects exposed to viruses from the same family for example subjects who recovered from a first infection with dengue virus may get infected again with worse course because of the presence of enhancing antibodies 75 similarly subjects who recovered from dengue may undergo a severe course from zika virus infection and vice versa 76 the occurrence of ade has been hypothesized also in subjects with severe course of covid-19 in china in areas that were previously hit by the epidemics of sars-cov 77apart from antiviral response other kinds of antibodies may be involved in the modulation of covid-19 immunopathology liu et al showed in an animal model of sars-cov infection that the presence of anti-spike igg actually promoted proinflammatory monocytemacrophage recruitment and lung injury moreover sera from sars-deceased patients enhanced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 and il-8 production by human monocyte-derived macrophages which was reduced by blockade of fcr 78 similarly mounting evidence suggests that vasculitis-related antibodies eg antiphospholipid antibodies may complicate and worsen the vascular inflammation 7980 interestingly several clinical observations both with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggest that natural anti-blood group antibodies may also play a role in the infection as o blood type could represent a protective factor as compared to a blood type 8182 and that anti-a antibodies could block the interaction of s protein with ace2 83 altogether nk cell and cd8 t cell-mediated killing of infected cells clearance of virus inside macrophages prevention of viral spreading by antibodies may contribute to the containment of the infectionthe recovery of viral infections is associated with switch-off mechanisms which include production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of infiltrating immune cells 84for reasons that are not fully understood some people fail to carry out the immune response properly since old age is the main risk factor for a severe course of the infection we hypothesized that the reduced t cell repertoire associated with immune senescence accounts for a delayed adaptive immune response in elderly subjects similarly to what has been reported for pandemic influenza or other viruses indeed elderly subjects may fail recruiting enough virus-reactive lymphocytes to contrast infections from viruses for which they do not have immunological memory this may be only one of the reasons why some patients develop severe courses of disease other factors affecting the course of the infection may include the production of non-neutralizing antibodies enhancing viral spreading and entry into cells by ade mechanism or the worsening of vascular damage by autoantibodies impaired innate immunity either due to ageing virus-induced mechanisms of immune evasion and possibly individual genetic differences also contributes to inadequate adaptive immune response it has been demonstrated in fact that blocking ifn-i signaling in mers-cov infection impairs virus-specific t-cell responses leading to increased inflammation and altered cytokine response 49 moreover a slow immune reaction may not be able to eradicate the infection in subjects affected with various comorbidities that can reduce the functional reserve necessary to cope with a prolonged multiorgan diseasetissue damage in covid-19 is associated both with direct cytopathic action of the virus on infected cells 2885 and with excessive activation of immune reaction with the release of enzymes and cytokines interestingly depletion of lymphocytes and increase of neutrophils in peripheral blood are changes typically associated with worsening of disease course although direct infection may account for increased lymphocyte apoptosis it seems more likely that depletion of lymphocytes depends on the production of inflammatory cytokines similarly to what has been described for other viral illnesses even if lymphopenia may also partly be due to accumulation of lymphocytes in diseased lungs 86878889 for example a direct correlation between serum ifn- and lymphocyte depletion was described in pigs with swine flu 90 and confirmed in experimental models of viral infection in mice lacking type i interferon receptor ifnar 91 thus the shortage of virus-specific lymphocytes may even be worsened by cytokine mediated immune paralysis notably lymphocytes from patients with severe covid-19 often present an exhausted phenotype 92 and this may reflect a functional impairment assessment of the immune response in a group of patients with severe covid-19 with respiratory failure highlighted features supportive of either lymphocyte depletion with low human leukocyte antigen -dr hla-dr expression on monocytes or macrophage activation syndrome subjects with macrophage activation syndrome had higher serum c reactive protein crp ferritin and il-1 levels and lower white blood cell count than those with lymphocyte depletion conversely subjects with lymphocyte depletion had higher levels of il-6 and a trend for higher tnf- in these patients anti-il6 treatment with tocilizumab resulted in increased circulating lymphocytes highlighting the role of cytokine storm in the immunopathogenesis of the condition 93 however since in at least a subset of severe cases has been shown an impaired type i interferon activation it might be possible that lymphopenia persistence in this setting might be type i interferon independent on the contrary increase of neutrophils is associated with tissue damage and cytokine storm recent data based on autopsy findings support the possibility that the release of neutrophil extracellular traps nets by neutrophils may contribute to the phase of amplification of organ damage and mortality in covid-19 leading to hypothesize a therapeutic role for medication inhibiting this process such as dnase neutrophil elastase inhibitors il-1 targeted therapies and colchicine 94the vicious circle between vascular damage lung damage inflammation and immune paralysis can rapidly be responsible for fatalities especially when patients cannot endure the challenge of the infection on vital functions because of comorbidities figure 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards can result from alveolar cell damage and lung inflammation and can be worsened by ace2 depletion lung vasculopathy with micro-thrombosis 95 the diseased respiratory environment is also exposed to the risk from secondary bacterial or fungal infections which can precipitate a fatal course of the infection 7 heart or kidney failure can also occur in severe cases 96 a crucial aspect of the disease is coagulopathy that can accelerate the progression toward multiorgan failure 97 vasculopathy and coagulopathy are probably related to the infection of endothelial cells by sars-cov-2 3198 but it could be worsened by the development of vasculitis with the production of autoantibodies such as antiphospholipid and activation of complement 798099higher expression of ace2 receptors may partly explain why young people seem to be less susceptible to severe infections from sars-cov-2 101 besides age several other factors also seem to modulate ace2 expression including diet sexual hormones drugs glucose metabolism smoking upregulates the expression of ace2 this may account for a lower than expected prevalence of smokers in diseases cohorts even though the overall role of smoking as a risk factor is still unclear 102 studies in animal models have suggested that ace inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers arbs upregulate ace2 expression 25 those observations were used to speculate on a possible increased susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection in patients under those treatments or vice versa if they could have a therapeutic role however three large studies a database study 103 a case-control study 104 and an electronic medical record analysis 105 including a total of more than 21000 infected patients failed to identify any correlation between ace inhibitor or arbs treatment and infection risk or disease severity scientific societies advice not to discontinue such therapies on the base of covid-19 fear or actual diseasewith aging several important changes in the innate and adaptive immune responses occur that can explain why older people are more prone to develop severe disease during viral infections this is particularly true for newly arising infectious organisms for which there is no protection from pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies generated after previous exposures to related virusesage-related changes in bone marrow result in decreased lymphopoiesis and increased output of functionally compromised myeloid cells in thymus tissue involution results in loss of naive t cells and contraction in t-cells repertoire diversity 106 studies in animal models showed a decline in reactivity to viral epitopes with a low naive precursor frequency in aged mice 107 gene expression analysis in critically ill patients with influenza suggest an impaired development of adaptive immunity leading to an unremitting cycle of viral replication and innate cytokine-chemokine release 108 coherently a relatively better performance of children and elderly in contrasting the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic has been explained respectively by a wider lymphocyte repertoire in children and immune memory for past cross-reacting viral strains in old peopleinterestingly the repertoire of naive t cells persists with aging in a homeostatic balance with memory t cells and can be reduced by the involvement of adaptive immune system in recurrent infections 109 whether immunosenescence associated with aging and specifically t cell repertoire reduction plays a significant role in the susceptibility of old people to sars is still uncertain 21deterioration of immune response in elderly represents a well-known challenge to vaccine developers as immunosenescence also involves antibodies production the contraction of b-cell repertoire with aging is less impressive than that of t cells 110 moreover while t cells reactivity is restricted to specific peptides antibodies frequently display some degree of cross-reactivity between distinct antigens consequently old people can boost the production of antibodies directed against antigenically related viruses when exposed to an infection maintaining a wider immunological memory this mechanism has a role in the antibody response to influenza virus where cross-reactive immune responses have been well described 111 also as recent findings have shown binding and blocking antibodies to common coronaviruses are higher in old adults than in the younger 112the ability of making antibodies also exploiting cross-reactive memory responses could be a double-edged sword cross-reactive antibodies are not always beneficial and in some cases they can do harm by enhancing inflammatory immune responses and viral entry into cells 113114 however even antibodies mediating viral infection can be protective in certain circumstances 115 even if the production of antibodies undergoes significant changes with ageing there is not any proof that these changes are related to the higher severity of covid-19 in the elderlythe innate immune system also becomes dysregulated and is characterized by heightened levels of basal inflammation because of increased baseline cytokine production and failure of activation of innate immune mechanisms in response to pathogens or vaccines 116 cells from older donors infected in vitro by influenza and west nile virus show dysregulated tlr-signaling in monocytes macrophages and blood dcs impaired ifn production and diminished induction of late-phase antiviral responses 117 as mentioned before ifn-i response has been shown to be key in determining outcomes in mers cov infected mice 49 thus it could be hypothesized that in the elderly dysregulation of ifn pathways could contribute to lethality from sars-cov-2 infection by determining the inability to control viral replication at the beginning of the infection and later facilitating the occurrence of a deleterious exaggerated inflammatory responsein experimental conditions the inoculum dose is a crucial factor influencing the outcome of the infection from many viruses high inoculum dose of viruses with direct cytopathic effect can lead to severe damage and death before adaptive immune response develops especially with fast-replicating viruses in influenza virus infection cytotoxic cd8 cells are the main player in killing virus-infected cells however with high viral inoculum dose cytotoxic cd8 cells can be killed by dcs depending on the cytokine environment 118 in an in vitro model to examine the effects of influenza infection on dc function t-cell proliferation occurred at low multiplicities of infection while at higher doses interaction between dc and t cells was defective partly because of hyperproduction of transforming growth factor beta 1 tgf1 by dcs 119 conversely extremely low doses do not infect dcs and can resolve without engaging the adaptive immunity 84point mutations in genes encoding for proteins involved in dna sensing and ifn response as mentioned before have been found to confer susceptibility to a narrow range of virus infections or even one particular virus such an example is that of mutations in genes that participate in the tlr3 signaling pathway which predisposes to severe presentation of herpes simplex virus hsv including hsv encephalitis 50 whether patients who develop lethal covid-19 infections harbor genetic variants predisposing to disease progression is unknown however this hypothesis is being investigated in genetic studies on young patients developing severe diseaseit is well-known that subjects with combined immunodeficiencies cid are susceptible to severe illnesses from various viruses 50 accordingly primary immunodeficiencies might explain a proportion of the rare covid-19 pediatric cases requiring intensive care however only a few cids can remain undiagnosed for a long time and thus it is unlikely that subjects with these disorders can encounter sars-cov-2 and develop a severe disease course indeed the only records of cids detected after severe viral illness concern subjects with undiagnosed idiopathic cd4 t-cell lymphopenia who developed severe varicella 120 or subjects with cartilage hair hypoplasia 121 covid-19 could also have a worse course in subjects with not-virologically suppressed hiv while no fatality has been reported in a small series of young patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy 122severe cases of covid-19 have been associated with the development of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh inborn errors of immunity affecting nk and cd8 t-mediated cytotoxicity have been associated with unexpected fatal infection from various viruses presenting with the clinical picture of primary hlh 123 thus it is possible that some patients develop severe illness because of defective cytotoxic functions of note hlh-related mutations are relatively rare in the population and therefore they are not likely to explain a significant proportion of severe cases patients with rheumatic conditions such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus who develop shlh-like inflammatory complications named macrophage activation syndrome are more likely to carry heterozygous variants in genes mediating the release of cytotoxic granules from nk cells and cd8 t cells 124 however their pathogenic role is unclear to date no case fatality from sars-cov-2 has been attributed to a monogenic primary immunodeficiencybioinformatic tools have already shown the different affinities of human leukocyte antigen hla molecules haplotypes to sars-cov-2 epitopes 125 those differences determine the quality of the immune response therefore might have a role in vaccine design ie to choose the most appropriate epitope in term of immune response to vaccine and to provide information to identify subjects with increased risk of severe disease and guide social interventions for example hla-b4601 haplotype has been predicted to be a risk factor for a severe disease as already shown by genetic population analysis in patients affected by severe sars-cov 126 on the opposite side b1503 allele is predicted to have high affinity for epitopes shared by different coronavirus thus representing a possible protective factor for disease severity through cross-response to identify high risk populations is of key relevance to implement stratified social distancing rules and disease prevention ie vaccine administration priorities to date there are no population studies on covid-19even though there is no definitive explanation of how sars-cov-2 has arisen hypotheses point toward a spillover from bats likely mediated by some other animal species as intermediate host 127 bats are known to be asymptomatic reservoirs for many different viruses that cause serious disease in humans and non-human primates such as sars and mers coronaviruses nipah and hendra paramyxoviruses and marburg and ebola filoviruses 128129130131understanding how can bats coexist with so many viruses with no overt disease could provide guidance for the identification of treatment targets in humans one hypothesis is that the bat immune system coevolved with viruses mitigating cellular pathways activated by viral infection to reach a state of reciprocal tolerance bats may be capable of limiting the infection-induced immunopathology even in the most highly infected tissues as a result of these unique adaptations at the cost of infection persistence and prolonged viral shedding 132 which is probably a prerequisite for viral spillover to other species bat cells are capable of containing virus propagation by inducing an effective ifn production in response to viral rna while limiting the expression of virus-induced inflammatory cytokines as gene-expression analyses have revealed bat cells have varied and tightly regulated expression patterns of different ifn stimulated genes isgs compared to human cells bat cells have higher baseline isgs expression levels and upon ifn stimulus show a higher peak but also a more rapid decline in isgs expression levels 133 these unique features are only one of several mechanisms that bats have developed to prevent excessive inflammation several species of bats have reduced production of tnf- 134 and adaptations in nk cell receptors signaling pathways that are associated with inhibitory responses 132interestingly bat immune cells also show significantly dampened activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome in response to rna viruses 135 nlrp3 is an important sensor for cellular stresses as well as viral and bacterial infections nlrp3 regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta il-1 a key cytokine in the development of inflammatory syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome sars-cov and mers-cov have been shown to induce nlrp3 inflammasome in mouse and human cells with multiple mechanisms 29 and this activation might play a key role in the infection-induced hyperinflammation and immunopathology 136137138139 a good balance between protective immunity and inflammation is crucial to overcome the infection prompt recruitment and expansion of virus-specific lymphocytes can lead to early viral clearance preventing the development of significant organ damage conversely slower activation of specific immunity may result in undisturbed viral replication with widespread cell damage and secondary inflammatory amplification notably sars-cov2 is a fast-replicating virus reaching viral load peak in the upper airways within 56 days from symptoms onset thus significantly earlier than sars-cov which peaked at about 10 days therefore a prompt and adequate immune response is crucial to avoid infection progression 140141all the components of immunity may act as friend or foe ifns are necessary in the first phase of the infection but may become harmful afterwards tissue macrophages and dcs are important players in creating the correct local environment to defeat the virus but they can be replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages with a stronger inflammatory activity and with the risk of bringing the virus to other organs neutrophils are needed for viral clearance in animal models of infection with influenza virus but are primary players of tissue damage in covid-19 antibodies may be protective or harmful by enhancing viral entry or by targeting vascular structures healthy people may cope with an imbalance in these mechanisms until proper anti-inflammatory anticoagulant and supportive treatments are given on the contrary people with older age and comorbidities may pay the higher fatality rate because of the establishment of vicious circles between inflammatory respiratory and vascular processes a possible list of critical mechanisms affecting the fate of covid-19 is proposed in table 1antivirals aim at blocking viral replication and related cell damage even though antivirals seem to be the most obvious causative therapy their efficacy might be limited to the initial phase of the illness and might not have any effect in the advanced stages when inflammatory mechanisms seem to prevail antivirals that have been used or proposed in covid-19 include lopinavirritonavir remdesivir ribavirin and favipiravirso far lopinavirritonavir has been the only antiviral agent undergoing a major randomized clinical trial lopinavirritonavir is an approved oral combination agent for the treatment of hiv the association has been previously used in sars and retrospective studies seemed to suggest a reduction in mortality and intubation rates in patients who received this treatment 142 the first published randomized trial in covid-19 was open-label and included 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection no adjunctive benefit in the time to clinical improvement mortality rates at 28 days and viral rna load at various time point was observed in patients who received lopinavirritonavir n  99 compared to patients who were managed as per standard of care n  100 143remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases in vitro testing of remdesivir has shown a potent activity against sars-cov-2 144 a small cohort of 53 patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 were treated with remdesivir on compassionate-use bases 145 clinical improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 36 of 53 patients 68 the results of one randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial that included 237 patients with covid-19 from china admitted to hospital with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less and pneumonia showed a small reduction in the time to clinical improvement with remdesivir but failed to find statistical significance 146 mortality was also similar among treated and non-treated patients this study failed to enroll the predetermined number of patients preliminary analysis from another randomized controlled trial involving 1063 patients in the united states have also been recently made available preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31 shorter median time to recovery 11 days versus 15 days compared with placebo p  0001 also in the group receiving remdesivir a survival benefit was reported with a mortality rate of 80 versus 116 for the placebo group p  0059 the trial closed to new enrollments on april 19 and more comprehensive results will soon be available nct04280705 while interesting these data still suggest that the role of antiviral treatment may be limited with a greater efficacy possibly to the early phases of infection likely due to the rapid replication of the sars-cov2 virusfavipiravir is a nucleotide prodrug whose active compound inhibits viral rna-dependent rna polymerase favipiravir is approved for the treatment of influenza virus infections in japan and china the results of a small open-label non-randomized control study conducted in china in covid-19 have been published recently 147 in the study patients receiving favipiravir plus inhaled ifn n  35 were compared with an historical cohort of patients who had been treated with lopinavirritonavir during the prior weeks n  45 patients in the favipiravir group had faster viral clearance 4 days vs 11 days and more frequent radiographic improvement 91 vs 62 still under review another chinese open-label randomized study showed that moderately ill patients but not mildly nor severely ill patients treated with favipiravir had higher clinical recovery rates at day 7 compared to patients treated with umifenovir a membrane-fusion inhibitor active against influenza 148 more trials are underwayribavirin has been empirically included into various treatment protocols for covid-19 even though there is little evidence for its efficacy 149 ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral rna-dependent rna polymerase with in vitro activity against sars-cov only at high concentrations ribavirin has been used for the treatment of sars and mers mostly in combination with ifns of 30 trials evaluating ribavirin in patients with sars 26 were classified as inconclusive and 4 reported possible harm due to the occurrence of hemolytic anemia and liver toxicity in a high proportion of treated patients 150 with these premises ribavirin likely has limited value for the treatment of covid-19chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit in vitro sars-cov-2 151 these agents appear to interfere with viral entry into cells as well as viral replication in addition they attenuate cytokine production and inhibit autophagy and lysosomal activity in host cells 151 given the long history of use in patients with malaria as well as in patients with rheumatologic conditions and considered the lack of alternatives the use of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin an antibiotic added mainly for its anti-inflammatory effects possibly due to attenuation of il6 for the treatment of covid-19 has widely spread despite very limited efficacy data and emerging concerns of cardiotoxicity especially for the association of the two drugs the only trial published so far is a small single center open label study on 36 patients with covid-19 the primary outcome in the trial was viral clearance from the nasopharynx not a clinical outcome at day 6 70 of patients who received hydroxychloroquine n  20 achieved viral clearance compared to 125 of patients in the control group n  16 152 the authors also pointed out the potential synergistic effect of the concomitant use of azithromycin since all the patients receiving the combination achieved viral clearance n  6 following the publication attention was drawn toward several design and methodological flaws of the study and the scientific validity of the findings have been questioned 153 beside the small sample size and the fact that no clinical or safety outcomes were reported several confounding factors were observed including the fact that six patients in the hydroxychloroquine group that met the inclusion criteria were removed from the analysis due to cessation of treatment as a consequence of worsening illness or medication-related adverse effects another still unpublished small clinical trial randomized 62 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine or placebo and found a reduction of time to clinical recovery this work nevertheless did not stratify patients for comorbidities and the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined 154pending peer review the results from several other works have emerged which question the safety and efficacy of this treatment a retrospective analysis of data from 368 hospitalized patients with covid-19 across the united states investigated the risk of death and the need for mechanical ventilation based on exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin placing a cautionary note in the study hydroxychloroquine either with or without azithromycin did not reduce the risk of mechanical ventilation moreover an increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone 155 similarly in a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients evaluating probability of intensive care transfer or death by means of an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach did not find evidence of hydroxychloroquine efficacy 156on 21 april the national institute of health expert panel that issued covid-19 treatment guidelines recommended against the use outside clinical trials of the combination of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin because of the potential for toxicities also it was recommended to pay attention toward patients receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for adverse effects especially prolonged qtc intervalhuman monoclonal antibodies specific for the sars-cov-2 virus might represent a possible passive serotherapy for selected patients several sars-cov monoclonal antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity were generated from b lymphocytes of patients that recovered from the 2003 epidemic a single human monoclonal antibody with cross-neutralizing activity against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 was recently reported 157 however no clinical experience or recruiting trials are available at the momentsignificantly increased amounts of several proinflammatory cytokines driving the uncontrolled immune inflammatory response of covid-19 have been measured in serum of patients who develop severe or fatal disease 158 which mediators have the most important role in immunopathology is still to be clarified several biological agents targeting inflammatory cytokines and cytokines receptors have been proposed as potential candidatespreliminary observations have been reported with the use of tocilizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting il-6 receptor approved for the treatment of cytokine-release syndrome following chimeric antigen receptor t-cell car-t therapy 159 in small case series the repeated administration of tocilizumab to patients with severe covid-19 was associated with rapid cessation of fever improvement of respiratory functions and thoracic imaging as well as reduction of c-reactive protein 160161 a larger prospective case series on 100 patients admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia showed an improved or stable respiratory status in 77 patients within 10 days from treatment start 162 several randomized-controlled trials are currently under way to evaluate the role of tocilizumab and other monoclonal antibodies targeting il-6 such as sarilumab and siltuximab preliminary data on compassionate use of siltuximab in 21 patients with pneumonia have shown improvement in 7 yet no conclusions can be inferred given the lack of control arm in the study 163 it should also be considered that il-6 has also significant anti-infective roles therefore caution is advised in respect to the possibility that its inhibition can result in greater incidence of opportunistic infections in treated patients especially when given together with corticosteroidsother anti-cytokine drugs seem to have a rationale for the treatment of covid-19 associated inflammation this is the case of anakinra an interleukin il-1 receptor antagonist used for various rheumatologic conditions especially considering the aforementioned ability of sars-cov and mers-cov to induce nlrp3 inflammasome and il-1beta a recent report showed promising results using high doses of anakinra intravenously in 29 patients with severe disease 164 with rapid decrease of inflammatory markers progressive amelioration of respiratory function and increased survival compared to a retrospective cohort with a good safety profile a second report on subcutaneous administration in nine patients 165 showed safety of the drug with a slower response on inflammatory markers another experience of high intravenous doses also showed safety and efficacy in severely affected subjects 166 similarly given the major role of inflammatory macrophages in covid-19 immunopathogenesis emapalumab an anti-ifn- monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis has been proposed 167 both drugs are under evaluation in currently recruiting trials in addition anti-tnf- monoclonal antibodies have been proposed as potential treatment to prevent progression to needing intensive care in covid-19 168 elements supporting a role of anti-tnf- are the evidence of elevated tnf- levels in patients with severe covid-19 158 and the biologic effects of anti-tnf- therapy which include a rapid decrease in both il-1 and il-6 levels 169 as well as the observation in preclinical model that anti-tnfs ameliorate the course of severe respiratory syncytial virus rsv and influenza in mice 170 notably lack of tnf- receptor as well as in vivo tnf- neutralization resulted in protection against sars-cov morbidity and mortality in mice 65171convalescent plasma has been used for various viral infections including h1n1 influenza sars and mers with some evidence of potential benefit 172173 hyperimmune globulin products are used in adults and children to prevent or to treat viral infections such as cytomegalovirus varicella zoster and respiratory syncytial virus plasma from individuals who have recovered from covid-19 containing antibodies to sars-cov-2 or specific antibody preparations derived from plasma may suppress viremia and modify the inflammatory response 174 in two small case series of critically ill patients with covid-19 administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by clinical improvement in all patients without safety concerns 175176 no experience with hyperimmune globulin products in covid-19 has been published so far small clinical experiences have been published with the use of donor pool intravenous immunoglobulin ivig 7177 their role is unclear nevertheless ivig may have both a partial inhibitory viral effect due to nonspecific cross-reaction and a well-known immunomodulatory effect in several inflammatory conditions including macrophage activation syndrome 178 ivig use may be most relevant in patients with specific organ involvement such as myocarditis and guillan-barr syndrome which have also been reported in association with sars cov-2 infection 179interferons are key molecules of innate antiviral response and might have a different role depending on the timing of administration based on preclinical observation on a mouse model 65 ifns have been proposed as a potential treatment of covid-19 for their in vitro and in vivo antiviral properties so far the use of inhalatory inf-1b has been used in china but no clinical data are available regarding its efficacy observations in sars and mers on the combined use of ifn and ribavirin failed to show any improvement in mortality or viral clearance 150180 given the previously discussed role of ifn in coronavirus diseases treatment timing could represent the most determining factor in mouse models ifn-i administration within 1 day after infection protected mice from lethal mers infection while delayed treatment failed to effectively inhibit virus replication and resulted in worsening of inflammatory changes in the lungs 49on the other hand janus kinase jak inhibitors have also been proposed to curb excessive ifn signaling in severe covid-19 baricitinib has attracted interest since beside its immunomodulatory properties it may reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells 181 however these drugs may also result in substantial depression of the immune response a small non-randomized study reported a cohort of 12 patients hospitalized for moderate covid-19 pneumonia who were treated with baricitinib in addition to lopinavirritonavir compared to the previous 12 consecutive patients with moderate covid-19 admitted before study start who were treated with lopinavirritonavir and hydroxychloroquine baricitinib-treated patients had a faster improvement of clinical conditions and respiratory parameters did not require intensive care and were discharged earlier notably treatment was tolerated in all patients with no serious adverse events or opportunistic infections 182 larger clinical trials are ongoingcorticosteroids have a rationale in covid-19 for their potent anti-inflammatory effect and their potential role in suppressing cytokine-related lung injury however considerations have been made that beside suppressing lung inflammation corticosteroids also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance observational studies in patients with sars and mers reported clinical efficacy but no clear association with improved survival while demonstrating delayed viral clearance and high rates of complications 150183184185186 in a recent meta-analysis evaluating the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe pneumonia caused by influenza corticosteroid therapy seemed to confer an increased risk of secondary bacterial infection and mortality 187 it is noteworthy to report however that a recent covid-19 series found that patients with ards treated with methylprednisolone exhibited lower mortality 46 vs 62 hazard ratio for death 038 p  0003 188 based on these experiences further studies assessing the role of corticosteroids in covid-19 would be of extreme importance and several clinical trials are ongoing the us national institute of health covid-19 expert panel considered their use in severely ill patients reasonable on a case by case basis taking into account factors as pre-existing medical conditions requiring chronic corticosteroid use or hemodynamic status 189the observation that viral entry into cells via ace2 receptor requires priming by cellular proteases mainly tmprss2 prompted in vitro trials with two clinically approved drugs for acute pancreatitis nafamostat and camostat which resulted in blockade of viral entry 16 another drug inhibiting tmprss2 is bromhexine a widely used antitussive agent considering the role of tmprss2 in viral entry these drugs could be suitable as prophylaxis in high-risk settings all these three drugs are currently undergoing clinical trialsthe use of heparin for covid-19-associated coagulopathy and its adjunctive potential anti-inflammatory role has been previously discussed 190it is too early to be able to determine whether people can be re-infected by sars-cov-2 after recovery from covid-19 re-detection of viral rna on nasopharyngeal swabs after two consecutive negative results was reported in asymptomatic patients during the convalescent phase 191 however since viral rna shedding has been observed for days to weeks after resolution of symptoms 140192 one possible explanation is that patients in whom sars-cov-2 rna was re-detected had a false negative result due to an insufficient viral load of the specimen or persistence of viral nucleic acids in the airways in the absence of the full potentially infectious virus much of our understanding of the immune response to coronavirus in humans comes from observations in sars-cov and mers-cov in longitudinal studies investigating the humoral immune response in patients who recovered from sars and mers neutralizing antibodies against virus s protein were detectable for up to two years 193194 in sars-cov and up to three years in mers-cov 195 whether humoral immunity confers protection to reinfection remains to be established a strong anti-spike antibody response appears to be protective in the susceptible host 196 however antibodies titer markedly declines already after one year and at 6 years only a minority of patients who recover from sars show detectable igg 197 suggesting that memory b-cells against sars-cov diminish over time in recent cohort studies antibodies against sars-cov-2 have been detected as early as the 4th day after symptom onset 198 and antibody levels do not appear to correlate with clinical severity notably a significant proportion of patients up to 30 who recovered from covid-19 develop low or absent neutralizing antibodies 9 the reasons why coronavirus infections do not elicit robust and long-lasting antibody response are still unclear according to some authors t-cell response may be more important than the humoral response both for recovering from primary infection and to prevent reinfections unlike antibodies sars-cov-specific memory cd8 t cells have been observed for up to 6 years post-infection 199200201202203204 virus-specific cd8 t cells are required for pathogen clearance during acute infection after that memory cd8 t cells persist at anatomical front-line sites of specific microbial exposure 205 and upon re-stimulation are capable of proliferating and secreting effector cytokines ifn tnf and il-2 and cytotoxic molecules granzyme b and perforin and to recruiting other immune cells 206 so far most of our understanding is derived from experimental studies in animal models in mouse models enhancement of sars-cov specific cd8 t cells by immunization with viral peptide-pulsed dcs results in a robust t-cell response earlier virus clearance and increased mouse survival 207208 recent observation in agammaglobulinemic patients of spontaneous recovery from sars-cov-2 infection supports the hypothesis that t-cell immunity might be more important than antibody response 71 these observations cast doubts on whether the antibody response can be used as a correlate or surrogate of protection following wild infection also it is likely that vaccines combining both humoral and cellular responses might be necessary for coronavirus prevention 196199 with humoral immunity being relevant especially in the first phase of virus infection reducing the initial viral load and controlling its spreading in respiratory organs while cellular immunity being important in the control of the inflammatory phase of the disease furthermore the efficacy of the above-mentioned convalescent plasma therapy suggests the potential role of humoral response elicited by a vaccine more information on the protective role of both humoral and cellular compartments will probably be obtained from observation of the vaccine-induced immune responsedespite huge amounts of data from thousands of research articles published each month most knowledge on covid-19 is derived from descriptive works to date a possible therapeutic approach could involve an antiviral and a cell-entry inhibitor for the first phase and an immunomodulant such as a il6 or il1 blocker for the second phase if inflammation persists with special treatment such as convalescent plasma hyperimmune globulins or sars-cov-2-specific monoclonal antibodies reserved to selected patients even if a fairly defined picture is being formed that summarizes the importance of virologic vascular and inflammatory factors much remains to be understood regarding the relationship of dependence between distinct pathological events during the course of infection consequently the proposal of therapeutic interventions which may seem rational in the various pathological phases is still today largely based on hypothesessevere acute respiratory syndrome related to coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is the infectious agent causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 may cause systemic inflammatory response with severe acute respiratory syndrome 12 table 1
 it emerged as an outbreak in early december 2019 in wuhan china 3 and from march 13 is a pandemic according to who criterion carrying a mortality of approximately 37 4 some previous pathological conditions of the patients may have a major impact on survival table 2
 we must bear in mind that currently no specific antiviral treatment is available for covid-19 and therefore further research into the pathogenesis of human coronavirus infection is imperative for identifying appropriate therapeutic targets right from the first time that the outbreak appeared in china the importance of immunomodulation in the clinical progression of the infection was described 5 given the severity of the immunological picture it has been suggested a series of etiopathogeneic mechanisms that are close to the ones involved in other immunomediated disordersone of the principal candidates to explain the catastrophic evolution of some people infected with sars-cov-2 is the haemophagocytic syndrome hps also named haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 6 and similarly the macrophage activation syndrome mas a subtype of hps in which the syndrome develops in the background of autoimmune disease particularly in adults stills disease systemic lupus erythematosus sle and vasculitis 67 hps is a life-threatening disorder characterized by unbridled activation of cytotoxic t lymphocytes natural killer nk cells and macrophages resulting in hypercytokinemia and immunomediated injury of multiple organs or systems 6 clinical and laboratory manifestations include fever splenomegaly neurologic dysfunction coagulopathy liver dysfunction cytopenias pulmonary involvement hypertriglyceridemia hyperferritinemia hemophagocytosis and diminished nk cell activity 6 according to prof shoenfeld 7 two more syndromes may present with similar severe clinical pictures and hyperferritinaemia the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and the adverse reaction to the biological compound anti-cd-28 7 8 9 interestingly these syndromes share similar clinical picture that severe covid-19 additionally it has also been suggested to test for soluble cd-163 scd-163 which represents macrophage activation the level of which was found to increase in mas and to parallel the ferritin level 10 whether the hyperferritinaemia is just an epiphenomenon that can help us for diagnostic or the ferritin is per se able to perpetuate the inflammatory loop is speculative however ruscitti and shoenfeld 11 have found that the h-chain of the ferritin is able to activate macrophages to increase the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and eventually ferritin this pathway would be common to all hyperferritinaemic syndromes covid-19 included 11 hps and mas could be triggered by an excessive immune response to a viral infection 61213 different virus has been related to hps mainly epstein-barr cytomegalovirus other herpes viruses and human immunodeficiency virus 614 pathology similar to hps was reported in both sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov infections 1516 and has been suggested in covid-19 5 however mcgonagle et al 17 hypothesised that mas related to severe sars-cov-2 infection has distinctive characteristics than classical mashps they argue that at the beginning the hyper-inflammatory reaction appears to be more confined to the lungs based on histopathological findings see below in addition covid-19 patients usually do not present lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly furthermore pulmonary hemophagocytosis has not yet been reported in covid-19 associated pneumonia 18since hps and mas are a hyperinflammatory syndrome an extreme elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine and acute phase reactants levels are observed the exception to this is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate which may be low due to hypofibrinogenaemia among them il-1 il-2 il-6 il-7 g-csf1 ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 tnf- and sil2r 61920 a hyperinflammatory profile that resembles hps is described in clinical features of hospitalised covid-19 patients 718 in addition the binding of sars-cov-19 to the toll like receptor tlr will be followed by the release of pro-il-1b cleaved by caspase-1 will induce inflammasome and il-1b activation which is a mediator of lung inflammation clinical observations indicate that few patients health worst at 68 days after infection according to theory of disease tolerance the most severe cases of covid-19 could be in part due to an uncontrolled immune response to sars-cov-2 infection 21 the reduction of this inflammatory immune response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe covid-19 consequently the proposal to treat severe covid-19 with immunomodulatory therapy as it is done in hps is likely to be beneficial to tackle hyperinflammation and eventually to ameliorate the severe clinical syndrome 522 theoretically corticosteroid treatment could have a role to suppress systemic and lung inflammation related to covid-19 nevertheless the therapeutic use of corticosteroids that has excellent pharmacological effects to suppress exuberant and dysfunctional systematic inflammation is still controversial 22 23 24 25 thus the current national health council nhc guideline emphasizes that the routine use of systematic corticosteroids is not recommended unless indicated for another reason in this line there was no available data showing that the patients benefited from corticosteroid treatment in sars-cov or mers infection which might be attributed to the suppression of immune response and virus clearance 23 in addition the use of the sera of immunised people for treating severe case of covid-19 has also been suggested however some concerns arise on this proposal in relation with the discrepancy on the severity of cases observed with current covid-19 one possible answer could be the role played by antibody dependent enhancement ade of sars-cov-2 26 immunization with sera of patients that contains non-neutralising antibodies could enhance disease by promoting virus infection in monocytesmacrophages or by inducing complement activation leading to vascular injury such as systemic necrotising vasculitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation furthermore ade up-modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation lymphopenia and cytokine storm as documented in covid-19 severe cases 26 it could happen in relapsing covid-19 patients possessing naturally acquired or passively administered antibodies against sars-cov-2 or in patients previously exposed to other coronaviruses a mechanism for ade in sars-cov-2 could be the evasion of neutralising antibodies against spike protein produced in previous virus infection 27 ade in sars-cov-2 may account for the geographic discrepancy in the pathogenesis thus an individualised monitoring of the harshest cases in order to identify coagulopathies associated with hyperinflammatory syndrome and consequently to treat them with immunosuppressing drugs could be a good approachthe advent of biologic therapies that target cytokines has expanded the armamentarium of treatments available for hpsmas and for similarity for covid-19 to include drugs that block il-1 il-2 il-6 il-18 and ifn 28 in addition other drugs capable to block other inflammatory pathways such as anti-malarials baricitinib or ruxolitinib janus-kinase inhibitors should also be considered table 3
data for this review were obtained through a comprehensive literature search using the keywords immunosuppressives antimalarials hydroxychloroquine chloroquine anakinra tocilizumab corticosteroids heparin low-molecular-weight heparin immunoglobulins sarilumab jak inhibitors cyclosporine ace inhibitors statins haemophagocytic syndrome acute respiratory distress syndrome the search was restricted to sars-cov-2 covid-19 treatment to identify articles published in english from medline pubmed and the cochrane library january 2020march 30th 2016 some interesting papers related to sars-cov mers thrombosis-related viruses cytokines and inflammation from 2003 were also reviewed and included according to their relevance clinical trials case-control or cohort studies brief reports communications reviews and systematic reviews were included current national guidelines on management of covid-19 were also retrieved and included cdc australian who spanish and italian the authors reviewed the selected manuscripts and finally the most appropriated were included for this reviewold anti-infectious drugs such as chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq firstly used as anti-malarial drugs and later as immunomodulatory treatment for autoimmune and rheumatic diseases mainly sle and rheumatoid arthritis have also shown a potential antiviral effect against sars and avian influenza h5n1 their effects are related to the change of cell membrane ph necessary for viral fusion and the interference with glycosylation of viral proteins furthermore cqhcq appear to have a summatory anti sars-cov-2 effects when administered with antivirals 29 and with azithromycin 30 we would stress on other possible pleiotropic effects of cqhcq other than anti-infectious antimalarials have many anti-inflammatory anti-aggregant and immune-regulatory properties they inhibit phospholipase activity stabilize lysosomal membranes block the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and in addition impair complement-dependent antigen-antibody reactions 3132 currently at least twenty clinical trials have already been registered to test the usefulness of cq and hcq for the treatment of covid-19 33 the just finished chinese clinical trial - chictr2000029559  have shown the potential of hcq in the treatment of covid-19 chen z et al submitted in vivo results although promising are limited to date thus considering the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of the anti-malarials and the pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and safety from long-time clinical use for other indications clinical research on cqhcq in patients with covid-19 is warranted 34 so on the basis of the weak evidence available treatment guidelines have already incorporated the use of cqhcq for treating patients with covid-19 thus hcq associated with other drugs could play a role in the treatment of sars-2-cov-19 infection 35tocilizumab tcz is an anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits signal transduction by binding sil-6r and mil-6r the main indication of the tcz use is rheumatoid arthritis 36 and giant-cell arteritis 37 in 2017 the us food and drug administration fda approved tcz for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome crs consisting of a systemic inflammatory response caused by the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to iatrogenic eg car-t therapies or infective stimuli 38in covid-19 patients il-6 plasmatic levels were especially high in severe cases histological examination of lung tissue showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates suggesting severe immune injury in a biopsy sample from a severe covid-19 patient 39 a case series in 20 chinese patients reported that tcz allowed the lung lesion opacity to be erased in 19 patients 905 oxygen intake lowered in 15 75 and oxygen stopped in one case moreover elevated c-reactive protein decreased significantly in 842 of the patients lymphocytes count normalised in 526 patients 40 in china tcz was recently approved for patients affected by severe sars-cov-2 pulmonary complications by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china further a randomised controlled clinical trial is ongoing in china chictr2000029765 41 in this way sarilumab sanofi  regeneron is an anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody launched for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis sarilumab is able to block the il-6 as the form that tcz does and could exert positive effects in cases of covid-19 with severe manifestations and high il6 levels currently a phase ii-iii clinical trial has started in united states of america and five european countries 42anakinra an anti-il-1 is another therapeutic option for treating patients suffering of severe covid-19 it is a recombinant and slightly modified version of the human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein il-1ra it is naturally secreted by monocytes and tissue macrophages that selectively binds to il-r and modulates its activity the blockade of il-1 leads to the inhibition of inflammatory responses 43 in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial the il-1 blockade anakinra in sepsis has been shown as beneficial with increased survival without increased adverse events 44 thus considering the similar cytokine storm between severe sepsis and severe covid-19 anakinra may play a role in the treatment of some severe or refractary casesthe cyclosporine-cyclophilin a complex inhibits a calciumcalmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin the inhibition of which is thought to suppress organ rejection by halting the production of the pro-inflammatory molecules tnf- and interleukin 2 il-2 due to these effects cyclosporine a cya has been proven very useful in the management of autoimmune diseases cyclophilin is also known to be recruited by the gag polyprotein during hiv-1 virus infection and its incorporation into new virus particles is essential for hiv-1 infectivity 45 experimental studies showed that cyclophilin inhibitors vg cya exert and inhibitory effect on sars-cov through the calcineurin pathway inhibition that at the same time plays an important role in the sars-cov virus replication in addition cya and tacrolimus down-modulated the calcineurinnuclear factor of activated-t cells inflammatory pathway induced by sars- 4647 in this way pathogenic similarities between severe pulmonary covid-19 and the anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5-positive anti-mda-5 amyotrophic dermatomyositis-associated rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease could be taken in account interestingly mda5 cell sensor may be activated by viruses 48 cya or tacrolimus with or without intravenous immunoglobulins ivig is a mainstay of pharmacologic treatment of the anti-mda5 syndrome 49 in addition cases of anti-mda5 syndrome complicated by haemophagocytic syndrome have been described 50 thus according to the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of calcineurin inhibitors cya and tacrolimus could be potential effective drugs for treating the severe forms of covid-19in the same line other targets could be therapeutic options such as il-37 and il-38 51 il-37 inhibits inflammation by acting on il-18ra receptor on mtor and increasing the adenosine monophosphate amp kinase il-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits il-1b and other pro-inflammatory il-family members 51 treatment of wt mice with recombinant human il-37 has been shown to be protective in several models of inflammation and injury these cytokines might represent novel therapeutic targets in patients with systemic inflammatory syndromesjak inhibition could affect both inflammation and cellular viral entry in covid-19 therefore richardson et al reported that baricitinib could be a potential treatment for acute respiratory disease related to sars-cov-2 infection 52 the janus kinase 12 inhibitor ruxolitinib currently fda approved in the usa for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis polycythemia vera and rheumatoid arthritis has been examined in a murine model of hps mice with the manifestations of hps were treated with ruxolitinib with improvement in manifestations and rapid decrease in serum il-6 and tnf- levels such positive results of an off-the-shelf currently available agent are encouraging because clinical trials could readily be undertaken in humans to treat autoimmune or inflammatory-based disorders 53 thus a clinical trial with ruxolitinib in patients with sars-cov-2covid-19 has been started with encouraging preliminary results capoachiani e et al unpublished resultshigh doses of intravenous immunoglobulins ivig exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects applications involving immunoglobulin have expanded to include treatment for immunodeficiency diseases immune thrombocytopenia itp kawasaki disease neurologic disorders sle and other severe or refractory autoimmune diseases 54 among the multiple effects on the innate and adaptive immune pathways related to ivig doses 05 g per kg weightday can interrupt the storm of inflammatory cytokines caused by different stimuli although preliminary studies have shown efficacy of the ivig in the treatment of patients with severe inflammatory complaints related to influenza 52 and sars-cov 55 infections we need more clinical data of covid-19 patients as evidence 56 currently a randomised controlled clinical trial of ivig in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection has been initiated clinical trialgov nct 04261426 we want to alert on the two potential and severe ivig adverse effects which could have a negative survival impact on patients with severe covid-19 a the transfusion immunoglobulin-related acute lung injury trali that may be a serious immunoglobulin transfusion-related adverse effect with high mortality manifests with acute respiratory distress syndrome within 6 h of perfusion 57 trali is an immune-mediated process and the neutrophil-priming hypothesis have been proposed as possible mechanisms 5859 b thrombotic events related to ivig treatment with an estimated incidence of 1169 57 according to the doubtful effectiveness of ivig treatment in patients with sars-cov and the risk of severe lung injury and thrombosis 60 we think the ivig option should be carefully analyzed before its use in severe covid-19 patients in addition the convalescent plasma cp and hyperimmune immunoglobulin hivig  neutralising antibodies - have been tried for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome of viral etiology including mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infection although preliminary reports have shown that cphivig are able to reduce the mortality especially when administered early after symptoms onset the real effectiveness is controversial and this therapy should be evaluated within the context of a well-designed clinical trials 61 62 63 64severe sars2-cov-2 as well as other infections are associated with clot pathway hyperactivity probably related to pro-inflammatory state high levels of d-dimer which is indicative of the activation of the coagulation andor thrombosis pathways as well as the risk of suffering venous or pulmonary thromboembolism pte are found high in covid-19 hospitalised patients in addition high levels of d-dimer are related with poor-outcomes and high mortality rate 65 66 67 although d-dimer levels are elevated in most patients with blood clots d-dimer levels also are elevated in many other disorders including infection in any event multiple pulmonary embolus has also been observed in these patients 6869 moreover it has been observed that covid-19 patients with severe type may develop disseminated intravascular coagulation dic pte and arterial thrombosis esteve-valverde e et al unpublished data in similar way that occurred is sars-cov 67 furthermore different diagnostic approaches have been proposed in covid patients with clinical suspicion of pte 70 finally data obtained from autopsies of 50 covid-19 patients showed microthombosis and sometimes thrombus affecting large pulmonary arteries even in the superior cava vein and right auricula gianattisonzogni unpublished results interestingly histologic data such as alveolar and interstitial inflammation extends to the closely juxtaposed pulmonary vasculature and the normal circulatory fibrinogen levels and regional fibrinolysis with elevated d-dimer formation seen in early covid-19 pneumonia are not a features of typical acute onset mashps 17 this hyper-inflammatory intra-pulmonary inflammation might influence a propensity toward severe local vascular dysfunction including micro-thrombosis and haemorrhage resulting in a lung centric pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy pic presentation rather than a dic presentation 7anticoagulation therapy is recommended for covid-19 patients when high d-dimer levels are detected except for patients in whom anticoagulants are contraindicated 71tang et al 72 reported a major improvement of clot activation markers and a reduction of 28-days mortality when covid-19 patients were treated with heparin the recommended dose of low-molecular-weight heparin lmwh is 100 u per kg weight per 12 h by subcutaneous injection at least 5 days clinicians should closely monitor the laboratory values of patients to be alert for side effects after anticoagulant treatment in addition heparin exerts other pharmacological effects beyond its antithrombotic properties furthermore a large body of evidence supports the concept that heparin has anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties lmwh promotes survival of human endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis in response to tnf- heparins are able to bind anionic molecules such as apl and block complement pathway activation 73 74 75 other anti-inflammatory effects of lmwh have been postulated to be specifically tnf-- mediated 76 in patients with heparin allergy fondaparinux is a good option fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide whose antithrombotic activity is the result of anti-thrombin-mediated selective inhibition of factor xa fxa neutralization of fxa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and further thrombus development 77 in animal models fondaparinux is able to prevent endothelial damage and to bind anionic molecules such as 2gp-i and 2gp-ianti-2gp-i complexes 78 furthermore amara et al 79 reported the capability of fondaparinux to block fxa-c3 cleavage and probably further delivery of c3a and c5a in addition diverse virus infections sars-cov and sars-cov-2 included appear to be associated with an antiphospholipid antibody positivity with potential pathogenic effects  80 81 and esteve-valverde et al traasvir study unpublished resultsthus with the anticoagulant therapy we could kill two birds with one stone to prevent thrombosis and to down-regulate the pro-inflammatory pathways nevertheless only with clinical trials we will be able to solve this conundrumglucocorticoids gcs exert inhibitory effects on a broad range of innate and adaptive immune responses because of their inhibitory effects on multiple types of immune cells gcs are remarkably efficacious in managing many of the acute disease manifestations of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders 82 the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of gcs rely on three main mechanisms that include a direct effects on gene expression by the binding of glucocorticoid receptors to glucocorticoid-responsive elements b indirect effects on gene expression through the interactions of glucocorticoid receptors with other transcription factors ie nf-k and activator protein 1 and c glucocorticoid receptormediated effects on second-messenger cascades 83 gcs have been used with different success in life-threatening conditions such as cid sepsis and acute distress respiratory syndrome adrs 84 85 86 by its clinical similarity gcs are currently empirically used in some hospitals in the treatment severe covid 19 patients and different therapeutic local guidelines have included them 87 however existing evidence is inconclusive or does not support for gcs treatment of covid-19 patients to date 88 89 90 91 92 prudent use with low-to-moderate doses and short courses of treatment could be advised in selected cases 879293 according to cochrane review 88 the who recommendations 91 and expert consensus statement from chinese thoracic society 90 some basic principles should be followed when using corticosteroids in severe covid-19 patients a benefits and risks should be carefully weighed before using gcs b gcs should be used carefully in critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia c for patients with hypoxemia due to underlying diseases or who regularly use corticosteroids for chronic diseases further use of corticosteroids should be cautious and d dosage should be low to moderate  051 mg kg daily of methylprednisolone or equivalent and duration should be short 7 days thus high doses or pulses of gcs are not recommended furthermore who 82 and cdc 93 recommend that corticosteroids not to be routinely used in patients with covid-19 for treatment of viral pneumonia or ards unless indicated for another reason finally in cases of life-threatening septic covid-19 patients clinicians who consider to add corticosteroids to goal standard treatment should balance the potential small reduction in mortality with potential effects of prolonged coronavirus sheddingpatients with severe covid-19 infection are at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and death angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 is a homologue of ace and functions as a negative regulator of the reninangiotensin system and it is expressed in the human lungs 94 ace-2 is also present in heart tissue in addition angiotensin-converting enzyme ii is a key molecule involved in the development and progression of acute lung injury 95 it is known that ace-2 is a functional receptor for the sars-coronavirus sars-cov-2 included 96 sars-cov-2 infects ace2 cells in the oral mucosa and lungs including ace-2 cells in the alveoli 97 thus sars-cov-2 induces direct lung injury by involving ace enzyme which contributes to diffuse alveolar damage and high levels of ace2 can protect against ards 98 it is worthy of mention that higher levels of ace-2 and ace2 cells higher regenerative capacity and a strong immune response lead to an effective viral clearance 99 with age or when certain comorbidities are present such as hypertension or diabetes the ace-2 levels decrease with subsequently slower in viral clearance sustained ace cell injury lung inflammation and risk of precipitating into ards 97100 numerous agents have been shown to modulate and upregulated ace2 expression including angiotensin peptides and some other peptide and steroid hormones 98 interestingly ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers increase ace2 levels this fact could partially explain the relationship between increased fatality rate of covid-19 in patients with cardiovascular diseases including hypertension 101 currently a clinical trial clinical trialsgov nct04287686 using recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 rhace2 as a treatment for patients with covid-19 is ongoingstatins induced potent inhibition via protein geranyl geranylation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production tnf- il-10 il-6 and il-8 in mononuclear synovial and endothelial cells statins also inhibit t-cell activation and proliferation leading to the immunomodulatory effects furthermore statins inhibit mhc-ii expression on endothelial cells and monocyte-macrophages via inhibition of the promoter iv of the transactivator and thereby repress mhc-ii mediated t-cell activation 102103 in 2014 it was suggested that statins might be used to treat patients with ebola virus disease 104 a supply of a generic statin and a generic angiotensin receptor blocker arb was sent to sierra leone experimental studies had shown that both drugs improved outcomes in experimental acute lung injuryards models 105106 a far as we know no data on use of these drugs on sars-2-cov-19 patients have been published so far clinical trials are needed to determine whether this drug combination might be used to treat patients with severe covid-19 107it is already known even in individuals with appropriate genetic background that environmental factors participate to trigger autoimmune disease ad it is also possible that infections accelerate an already stablished subclinical autoimmune disorder 108 diverse mechanisms have been proposed ie molecular mimicry cross-reactivity between the microorganisms and host tissue the production of superantigens deviation of the balance between t-helper subsets toward th1 or increase th1th2 regulatory t cells treg ratios loss of active cytokine regulation and the apparition of self-neoantigens 108109 thus a variety of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the onset of ad but all of them are dependent of the autoreactivity of t andor b lymphocytes that have escaped of the regulatory controls the increased levels of th1-derived cytokines mainly il-1 il-6 tnf- and ifn- may be the effects of autoreactivity but in turn may facilitate the loss of immune control and eventually the apparition of ad 109 as an example il-6 a proinflammatory cytokine also affects t cells il-6 is one of the factors that determine how nave cd4 t cells differentiate into particular effector t cell subsets il-6 in combination with transforming growth factor-beta tgf- preferentially induces differentiation into th17 cells whereas il-6 inhibits tgf-induced treg development the resultant predominance of th17 cells over treg cells may be responsible for the breakdown of immunological tolerance and may therefore be pathologically involved in the development of ad 110 deregulated excessive il-6 synthesis during this protective process or persistent il-6 production leads to the development of a severe acute life-threatening complication the so-called cytokine storm or ad respectively 111 hla-class ii and particularly hla-dr are expressed constitutively mainly by antigen presenting cells apc and b cells and by some activated t cells their expression is essential for starting the adaptive immune response and help to clear infections through it furthermore hla-dr overexpression on these cells or the apparition de novo class-ii-dr complex in other cells that usually lack hla-dr may facilitate its recognition as non-self cells and eventually cause ad ifn- leads to hla-dr gene expression concomitant with inflammatory cytokine genes such as il-1 beta tnf- and il-6 in vitro 112 this mhc class ii upregulation increases mhc-restricted antigen presentation and adaptive immune response in addition ifn- can inhibit the differentiation and proliferation of th2 cells and the sustained response of th1 cells is involved in the occurrence and development of ad many infectious agents like epstein-barr virus cmv and parvovirus among others have been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain ad vg rheumatoid arthritis ra sle and psoriasis although the exact mechanism by which pathogens causes pathology is unknown presence of class ii molecules is mandatory 108113 thus certain viral infections coronavirus among them are able to induce a high amount of proinflammatory cytokines in predisposed host that eventually may cause hyperferritinaemic syndrome haemophagocitycmas-like syndrome 7108 in addition the increase of th1 and th17-derived cytokines will induce proinflammatory milieu apart a decrease in il-4 il-10 and tgf- with a subsequent decrease in total and functional tregs cd4  cd25 and cd4  cd25  foxp3 that limits the major arm to control self-tolerance another issue that deserves some consideration is the role of treg cells in the severity of the covid-19 it has been reported that severe cases present a lower proportion of nave tregs but a higher of memory tregs which in turn although not demonstrated probably may play a role leading to a high intensity autoimmune response 114 furthermore ifn- is able to increase the expression of the class-ii-dr molecules in immune cells and to induce their expression in non-immune cells thereby facilitating the apparition of auto-neoantigens autoimmune response and eventually ad 115 in conclusion combination of the possible molecular mimicry viral particles plus cytokine imbalance 116 plus treg cells decrease and class-ii-dr molecules overexpression are the perfect storm for a loss of self-tolerance autoimmune dysfunction and eventually adcovid-19 is a primarily respiratory tract infection with different forms of clinical manifestations while most infected people only develop mild illness approximately 1520 develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and 5 require admission to an intensive care unit in severe cases covid-19 with mas occurs in patients with ards sepsis and septic shock and ultimately multiorgan failure and death linked to sustained il-6 and il-1 elevationwhile mild clinical forms only require symptomatic management in moderate-severe forms in-hospital surveillance with general measures plus antivirus andor hcq administration is necessary however in more severe and life-threating cases a high intensity pharmacological treatment is recommended the pathogenesis of the acute pulmonary injury related to covid-19 is very similar that occur in other disorders that induce high hyperinflammatory state with a release of high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly il-1 il-2 il-6 and tnf- a pro-thrombotic status appears later thus drugs that usually serve to treat rheumatic or autoimmune syndromes may play a major role in this setting to date only hcq has proved to be useful for the treatment of severe cases of pneumonia related to covid-19 attention should be paid with cardiac side effects when high hcq doses are administered in covid patients however pre-clinical and few clinical made in patients with severe covid-19 show that intense immunosuppressive drugs improve clinical severity and reduce the mortality rate thus antivirals and supportive measures apart the combination of high hcq doses plus immunomodulatory agents such as tocilizumab cyclosporine or others are warranted mainly in the context of clinical trials in order to demonstrate a possible benefit in those severe covid-19 patientsif this schema fails ivig or short course of gcs can be tried high prophylactic or full heparin dose should be administered according to d-dimer levels the role played by jak-inhibitors statins or ace-2-agonist is currently unknown in addition the effectiveness of the transfusion of hyperimmune plasma  neutralising antibodies -obtained of cured covid-19 patients is speculative attention should be paid when neutralising antibodies are used since the effectiveness or deleterious effect can be time-dependent only randomised clinical trials although difficult to perform in this context would be the pathway to exit from this labyrinth and allow the scientific community to affront this colossal challenge in these lines different trials involving hydroxychloroquine tocilizumab sarilumab anakinra immunoglobulins plasma hyperimmune cyclosporine a and ruloxitinib are ongoing or just started a possible therapeutic approach can be seen at table 4
 thus we face a double edge sword when considering treatment with immunosuppressive drugs in those patients one the one hand it may be useful to control the inflammatory response that certainly may be harmful for the patient and on the other side it could favour the virus shedding however taking in account the poor outcomes of these patients and meanwhile we are waiting for more results based on clinical trials our feeling is that immunosuppressors play a major role and that as earlier the immunosuppressive treatment is started the less complications and deaths there will be the future will

2019 covid-19 occurred in wuhan hubei province china a novel coronavirus was later identified as the cause of covid-19 1by february 11 2020 a total of 72314 cases had been reported in mainland china with 44672 618 confirmed cases a total of 1023 patients died with a case fatality rate of 23 and most of the deaths were in patients over 60 years of age among the confirmed cases severe cases and critical cases accounted for 138 and 47 respectivelythe coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses assessed the novelty of the novel coronavirus and formally recognized it as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-covs designating it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice 2however unlike the sars that occurred in 2003 sars-cov-2 infection not only leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards but is also associated with significant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods the name of covid-19 was chosen recently by the world health organization to cover the diverse clinical manifestations and reflect the complexity of the disease common complications among covid-19 patients include shock ards arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury 1 especially for patients who require icu care significant cardiovascular impairment has already been observed characterized by elevation of cardiac biomarkers abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography and eventual circulatory failure cardiovascular impairment is now drawing growing attention in clinical practice and the american college of cardiology has already released a clinical bulletin on feb 13 2020 to address the cardiac implications of covid-19 3inflammation plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular impairment and even mods as a cardiologist and a member of the high-level expert group appointed by the national health commission to fight covid-19 during the clinical practice i found that the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy might be instructive in the management of covid-19 especially those severe cases therefore in this article we would like to summarize the related available information and share our perspectivesthe virus might directly infect the myocardial tissue and lead to cardiac injury cardiac injury has been noted as a protruding clinical feature in covid-19 patients in a study of 138 patients 10 patients were diagnosed with cardiac injury and 8 of them required icu care accounting for 22 of all the severe cases compared with the non-icu patients icu patients had higher level of hypersensitive troponin i and creatine kinasemb indicating that cardiac injury is associated with the disease severity 1 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share the same functional host-cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cell entry 4 but the affinity of ace2 for sars-cov-2 is approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than that for sars-cov 5 ace2 is highly expressed in both the lung and heart 6 and the sars-cov viral rna has been detected in autopsied heart samples from sars patients 7 however large-scale autopsy or biopsy studies are still required to further confirm the myocardial infection in covid-19 by the tissue viral rna detection or in situ hybridization at heart and endothelium in addition it is worth noticing that both blockades of at1 receptors and inhibition of ang ii synthesis would increase the expression of cardiac ace2 8 therefore for patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure hf regular treatment with ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arb could further increase the risk of coronavirus infection figure 1 however the causal relationship between aceiarb intake and increased viral load and deleterious outcomes in covid-19 is still uncertain animal studies even showed a protective effect of arb in lung injury during sars-cov infection 9 10 considering the solid evidence of the beneficial effect of aceiarb in cardiovascular diseases it is currently not recommended to discontinue the rass inhibition treatment in covid-19 11similar to sars-cov and mers-cov infection sars-cov-2 infection can also induce excessive and aberrant host immune responses leading to a cytokine storm 12 studies have shown increased amounts of cytokines such as il-1 il-1ra il-6 tnf- il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fgf basic g-csf gm-csf ifn- ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a mip-1b in the serum of covid-19 patients and the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 1 13 an autopsy study of a covid-19 patient also revealed that there were a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the heart tissue besides the flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood found that cd4 and cd8 t cells were hyperactivated and the concentration of highly proinflammatory th17 cells significantly increased 14 cytokines play an important role in the immune response to defend against viral infections however it has also been recognized that dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immunopathology inflammation after infection can be progressively amplified through positive feedback and eventually form a cytokine storm leading to systematic self-attack which is a well-established explanation for mods during coronavirus infection 15 16sars-cov-2 infection is more likely to affect older patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities 17 according to a study 42 of the confirmed cases and 227 of deaths have cardiovascular comorbidities 18 the fatality rate of patients with comorbidities was much higher than that of patients without comorbidities and the fatality rate of patients with cardiovascular diseases 105 was the highest 18 therefore covid-19 patients are at risk of acute cardiovascular events secondary infection disorder of sodium and water homeostasis hypoxia tissue hypoperfusion and shock occurring during covid-19 can all result in the aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases and trigger severe events such as acute coronary syndromes or exacerbation of hf additionally a study has demonstrated that sars-cov infection can lead to the downregulation of ace2 and activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system rass which would further increase the cardiovascular burden and contribute to adverse outcomes 7 figure 1in addition to the three mechanisms the treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids glucocorticoids and anti-viral agents such as lopinavirritonavir lvpr interferon- ifn- ribavirin and azithromycin could further increase the cardiovascular risk of covid-19 patients and bring additional challenges the harmful effects of nsaids and glucocorticoids on the cardiovascular system have been well-demonstrated by numerous studies that they can increase the risk of all cardiovascular events myocardial infarction mi hf and cerebral infarction 19 20 lpvr can induce cardiac conduction alteration and qtc andor pr interval prolongation further leading to atrioventricular block and torsade de pointes lpvr may also increase the risk of mi 21 besides protease inhibitor therapy has been associated with hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia and lipodystrophy 22 and such metabolic disturbances were also verified in patients treated with lpvr 23 ifn- is associated with hypertension hypertriglyceridemia and various cardiovascular adverse reactions and has been given a us boxed warning for its potential risk of ischemic disorders 24 a statement from the american heart association has announced that ifn- can cause numerous direct cardiotoxicities including arrhythmias mi and cardiomyopathy and can also exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction 25 a us boxed warning has been issued for ribavirin that the hemolytic anemia associated with ribavirin may worsen underlying cardiac disease and lead to fatal and non-fatal mi 26 a recent study has shown that azithromycin could reinforce the anti-viral effect of hydroxychloroquine 27 however its proven risk of severe qt prolongation should also be considered 28 especially when it is combined with hydroxychloroquine to treat the elderly covid-19 patients 29cardiovascular protective strategies are urgent for the prevention and management of severe adverse cardiovascular events which is of great significance to the overall prognosis of covid-19 patients the clinical bulletin released by the american college of cardiology has issued several points of clinical guidance regarding cardiac complications 3 and the chinese society of cardiology of chinese medical association also developed an expert consensus on the clinical management of patients with emergent high-risk cardiovascular disease during the epidemic period 30 however whether the conventional treatment is sufficient to overcome such challenges and whether any additional strategy to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular attack is needed in severe cases of covid-19 remain unclearexcessive inflammation should be considered as a promising target because it plays an important role in all three mechanisms described above it has already been demonstrated that for myocarditis with or without viral trigger inflammation is implicated in the development of both acute cardiac injury and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy 31 there is also abundant evidence that inflammation participates in various cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease cad and hf especially in atherosclerosis inflammation promotes the formation destabilization and rupture of atheromatous plaques and has already been recognized as an independent risk factor and prognostic predictor 32therefore conventional cardiovascular treatment plus anti-inflammatory therapy is a reasonable enhanced strategy for better management of cardiovascular impairment in severe cases of covid-19 in addition as the inflammatory attack on different organs shares numerous similar mechanisms and pathways such as the inflammatory response under ischemiareperfusion injury iri of the heart liver and kidney 33 suppression of the systematic inflammatory response will not only exert cardiovascular protection effect but also have potential benefits for mods rheumatologists have also focused on the dysregulated inflammation and suggested that there might be a window of opportunity for immunosuppressive strategies used to treat rheumatic diseases to serve as strong allies in the fight against covid-19 34 35many clinical trials have been conducted in the past decade to directly test the feasibility of using different anti-inflammatory agents for cardiovascular protection under various conditions mainly including cad myocardial iri hf myocarditisdilated cardiomyopathy and rheumatic diseases rheumatoid arthritis ra psoriatic arthritis etc accumulating evidence has supported the efficacy of this novel strategy in improving cardiovascular outcomes here we reviewed the currently available cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in clinical trials with positive results 3647 the detailed information of these trials is listed in table 1the immune pathway linking il-1 tnf- and il-6 known as the central pathway has long been implicated in atherosclerosis and is considered to play an important role in cad 48 the significant effect of such a central pathway has also been recognized in many other fields of cardiovascular research 4952 and a large portion of the clinical trials reviewed above was designed to target this pathway activation of the central pathway has already been observed in covid-19 and should therefore be considered as a promising target 13 a multicenter randomized controlled trial chictr2000029765 has been registered to evaluate the efficacy and safety of il-6 blockade using tocilizumab in covid-19 according to the preliminary treatment results currently released among the 14 patients recruited maximum age 82 including 9 severe cases and 2 critical cases tocilizumab significantly improved the fever symptom and lung function and also accelerated the absorption of lung lesions in addition to the benefits reviewed above it is worth mentioning that tocilizumab also has a potential electrophysiological protective effect increased il-6 level has been associated with acquired long qt-syndrome in patients with systemic inflammation leading to higher risks for arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes 53 in ra patients tocilizumab treatment led to a rapid and significant qt shortening correlating with the decrease in crp and cytokine levels which might benefit the overall mortality 54 55 such anti-arrhythmic potential may further support the application of tocilizumab in covid-19 patients to counteract the risk of adverse qt prolongation and related life-threatening arrhythmias associated with elevated il-6 and the anti-viral agents a series of clinical trials on chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 are also currently underway and have revealed considerable benefits 27 chloroquine has now been included in the 6th version of the diagnosis and treatment plan for novel coronavirus pneumonia 56 in addition to its direct antiviral effect 57 chloroquine might also exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the central pathway 58 hydroxychloroquine hcq has long been used to reduce inflammation in patients with ra and lupus in a nationwide cohort study hcq use was associated with decreased cad risk in the ra population 59 besides an oxi trial nct02648464 is currently underway to study the effect of hcq on the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events among mi patients 60 therefore we recommend targeting the central pathway by blockade of il-6 tocilizumab il-1 canakinumab il-1 monoclonal antibody anakinra il-1 receptor antagonist and tnf- etanercept infliximab to control the cytokine storm in the acute phase of covid-19 thereby reducing cardiovascular impairment and even mitigating modsstudies of iri and myocarditis have revealed that the th1 response characterized by the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines is activated in the early disease phase and is associated with acute cardiac injury 6163 while the th2 response dominates later promoting the resolution of acute inflammation and tissue repair m2 macrophage polarization was found to be a significant change contributing to the transition from the th1 to th2 response and monocyte-derived il-10 is a well-recognized th2-related anti-inflammatory cytokine that is highly expressed in the reparative phase and inhibits the th1 response 64 65 early activation of the th2 response or increased il-10 expression in iri and myocarditis could significantly inhibit the secretion of th1-related proinflammatory cytokines and reduce myocardial necrosis 6669 patients with covid-19 had high amounts of il-1 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 indicating an activated th1 response besides sars-cov-2 could also initiate increased secretion of th2 cytokines especially il-10 which is different from sars-cov infection 70 therefore the implantation of mesenchymal stromal cells mscs from allogeneic donors with an activated th2 response or ex vivo bone marrow-derived mscs after m2 macrophage polarization might increase the level of il-10 in the acute phase of covid-19 and serve as a possible solution to inflammation-mediated damage in addition to the application in cardiovascular diseases reviewed above cellular therapy using mscs has also shown efficacy in the management of ards and is now being evaluated in phase 12 trials 12inflammation in the acute phase can lead to extensive injury however it should also be noted that after the acute damage chronic residual inflammation that occurs with fibrosis during the reparatory phase can also result in persistent organ dysfunction studies of hf due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic myocarditis have found that chronic residual inflammation is associated with myocardial fibrosis and adverse ventricular remodeling 49 7173 in addition the long-term inflammatory status is also a hazard to atherosclerosis 32 during the follow-up of sars and mers patients it was also observed that in those who survive intensive care residual immune responses could lead to long-term lung damage and fibrosis causing functional disability and reduced quality of life 74 75 therefore in addition to the control of acute injury it is also of great significance to conduct long-term follow-up after admission to monitor residual inflammation in covid-19 patients especially those with severe clinical manifestations or intense acute inflammatory responses after excluding potential contraindications long-term anti-inflammatory therapy such as steroids azathioprine and canakinumab should be considered to reduce the residual inflammation and prevent further chronic structural and functional damagehyperactivated inflammation is fundamental in the development of cardiovascular impairment and even mods in covid-19 in addition to conventional cardiovascular treatment anti-inflammatory therapy is a reasonable strategy to further enhance cardiovascular protection and potentially mitigate mods by reviewing the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of covid-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in clinical trials with positive results we believed that targeting the central pathway il-1 tnf- il-6 balancing the th1 and th2 response and administering long-term anti-inflammatory therapy should be considered as promising strategies to control cardiovascular impairment or even mods during the acute and recovery phases of covid-19 the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies might be of great value to the management of covid-19 patients and we recommended to take such experiences as references for clinical practice and conduct related clinical trials we here propose a possible algorithm regarding the selection of anti-inflammatory therapy for covid-19 patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular impairment figure 2despite all the beneficial effects described above it is also important to pay attention to the potential adverse cardiovascular effects of these drugs for tocilizumab hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are both common adverse events prompting concern about increased cardiovascular risk 76 especially tocilizumab was widely noted to induce a proatherogenic lipid profile with increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol 7779 however these changes can be improved by concomitant therapy with statins 80 for tnf inhibitor tnfi although not universally acknowledged it might not be beneficial to hf severe hf remains a contraindication to tnfi treatment in ra patients a clinical trial showed that high-dose infliximab could be harmful to patients with moderate-to-severe hf 81 for ra populations a cohort study found that tnfi might increase the risk of both first hospitalization and exacerbation of hf in elderly patients with ra 82 additionally for hydroxychloroquine a recent study pointed out that hydroxychloroquine could lead to unwanted qt interval prolongation by blocking the kcnh2-encoded hergkv111 potassium channel thereby increasing the risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death 83 therefore biochemical indicators hemodynamic parameters and cardiac electrophysiology profiles should be monitored in clinical practice to avoid drug-induced adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors cardiac function or lethal arrhythmias besides corresponding treatment such as lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications should be prescribed if necessarycurrently a large number of novel therapies from preclinical studies or in vitro drug screening have been registered and accelerated into clinical practice however the safety profiles of these therapies have always not been well-characterized especially for elderly covid-19 patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction in addition as many of the therapies were proven to be effective only by in vitro experiments or poorly designed small-scale clinical studies the exact benefits were also not guaranteed therefore clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or in vitro drug screening should proceed with caution due to unguaranteed efficacy and safety profiles recently experts from multiple research institutions in china raised their criticism and announced an urgent call for increasing the scientific rigorousness of clinical trials on covid-19 84 considering timeliness and safety we suggest prioritizing cardiovascular protective strategies that have been proven by large-scale clinical trials for proof-of-concept studies and clinical application on covid-19 instead of rushing into new drug research and developmentthe original contributions presented in the study are included in the

conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe current covid-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus sars-cov-2 and initiated with the first cases observed in wuhan china in december 2019 has expanded dramatically throughout the world 1 2 this expansion has had devastating effects in many countries due to its contagiousness and the high number of patients presenting with severe infections and elevated death risk requiring specialized medical care in intensive care units icu for this reason the who declared it a global sanitary emergency on january 30 2020 3 an important aspect to highlight during the present crisis is the speed at which research studies have been developed leading toward a better understanding of the epidemiology clinical manifestations risk factors and transmission dynamics 1 48 as well as to the identification of the etiological agent 9 10 including its genome morphological structure and molecules 1113 its relationship with other coronaviruses 14 its entrance into the host cells by binding the angiotensin ii converting enzyme ace2 9 its intracellular replication 15 and the immune response of the infected individuals 1619 all these studies aim at developing diagnostic tests strategies for clinical management effective antiviral agents and eventually production of a protective vaccinethe goal of this review is to analyze the main aspects of the immune response against sars-cov-2 and the relationship between the protective and inflammatory responses and covid-19 clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to severe clinical presentations the review also highlights the principal immunological research challenges posed by covid-19 pandemics the immune response in humans and experimental animals against infection by sars-cov and mers-cov has been studied extensively and there are many excellent reviews 2023 however due to the similarities of covid-19 with sars and mers it will be necessary at certain specific points to cite the research done on those infectionsthe virus responsible for the epidemic that began in wuhan was simultaneously identified by wu et al 9 and by zhou et al 10 who named it wh-human 1 and 2019-ncov respectively these researchers also deciphered the virus genome its origin from bat coronaviruses and ace2 as its receptor on the membrane of host cells on february 11 2020 the who officially named the infection covid-19 and the virus as sars-cov-2 24sars-cov-2 belongs to the family coronaviridae which includes a large number of species capable of infecting various wild animals some of which also affect humans 2527 in humans most coronavirus infections result in mild respiratory infections and may be responsible for 2030 of common colds 28 however both sars-cov and mers-cov which emerged in the last two decades were responsible for epidemics of severe respiratory syndromes the three coronaviruses causing more serious pathologies belong to beta-cov 23 and despite their genomic and structural similarities they differ significantly epidemiologically sars-cov and mers-cov have a low transmissibility but a high lethality while sars-cov-2 has an extremely high transmissibility and a degree of lethality not yet established globallycoronaviruses have a single-stranded positive rna of nearly 30 kbp a spheroidal shape and a diameter of 80120 nm their envelope contains the spike s- membrane -m- and envelope -e- proteins and the nucleocapsid -n- inside the virion that covers the rna 23 on the genome from 5 to 3 are located the genes for the replicases orf 1ab which occupy two thirds of the genome and code for the polyproteins pp1a and pp1b 9 23 29 located toward the 3 end are the genes for structural proteins s e m and n 9 23 30protein s is the best studied of the coronaviruses proteins since it contains the receptor-binding-domain rbd for the ligand on the host cell membrane and also has epitopes recognized by t and b cells which induce the production of neutralizing antibodies 31 s is a type i trimeric glycoprotein that protrudes from the virion membrane giving it the appearance of a crown s is formed by two subunits s1 or bulb that contains the rbd 3239 and s2 or stalk responsible for the fusion of the virion with the host cell membrane 23 35 36 38 4042as described above the main receptor for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 on the membrane of the target cells is the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme ace2 a metallopeptidase present on the membrane of many cells including type-i and -ii pneumocytes small intestine enterocytes kidney proximal tubules cells the endothelial cells of arteries and veins and the arterial smooth muscle among other tissues 43 44 rbd-ace2 binding induces conformational changes on s that lead to cleavage of s1 and s2 a process mediated by the serine protease tmprss2 allowing s2 to facilitate the fusion of the virus envelope with the cell membrane thus permitting viral rna entrance into the cytoplasm of the target cells 23 31 35 42 45 thereafter viral rna serves as a template for the translation of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1b that are cleaved into 516 non-structural proteins nsp2-nsp9 which in turn induce rearrangement of the membranes to form the vesicles where viral replication and transcription complexes are anchored the virions are assembled in the er-golgi and mature virions are subsequently released by the secretory pathway 23the covid-19 pathological process exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infections to mild common cold-type moderate and finally severe 15 infections the latter frequently requires hospitalization in icu to ensure assisted respiratory support and other medical treatments until recovery or possibly death of the patient the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations found in covid-19 patients has been associated with risk factors such as gender and age diabetes cardiovascular disease or diseases or treatments affecting the immune system result in the highest risk of severe disease and death 6 8 8 4648 it is however estimated that nearly 80 of all infections remain undocumented either because patients are asymptomatic or present with very mild symptoms 49 from the epidemiological point of view these inapparently infected persons may have low viral loads while still disseminating the virus and can therefore be responsible either for silent epidemics leading to infection in more susceptible people who will eventually develop a clinical disease or for contributing to the establishment of herd immunity 28 50sars-cov-2 is acquired by exposure to microdroplets present in the exhalates of infected individuals or by contact with viral particles present in contaminated fomites once the virus reaches the bronchioles and alveolar spaces the main targets are the cells of the bronchial epithelium and the type-ii ace2 pneumocytes of the alveolar epithelium sars-cov infection induces autophagy 51 52 detachment of the basal membrane and inhibition of ace2 expression 20 53 hence allowing angiotensin ii to bind the at1ar receptor resulting in acute lung damage 54 importantly the main early defense mechanism of the infected cell is the production of type-i and type -iii ifn and although coronaviruses are sensitive to their anti-viral effects they are able to inhibit its induction 16 20 52 55 the release of large number of virions leads to both infection of neighboring target cells and viremia the latter resulting in systemic infection since ace2 cells are widely distributed in many tissues 43 44during viral infections after viruses enter the host cells they are recognized by pattern recognition receptors prr such as tlr7 and tlr8 in the case of single-stranded rna viruses rig-i-like rlrs and nlr all expressed by epithelial cells as well as by local cells of the innate immune response such as alveolar macrophages 23 upon ligand binding prrs recruit adaptor proteins which activate crucial down-stream transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor irf nf-b and ap-1 resulting in production of the type-i and -iii antiviral interferons and different chemokines 56 these chemokines attract more innate response cells polymorphonuclear leukocytes monocytes nk cells dendritic cells dc which also produce chemokines such as mig ip-10 and mcp-1 capable of recruiting lymphocytes which in turn will recognize the viral antigens presented by dcs 20 22 recent publications highlight the initial phases of the sars-cov-2 infection compared to other coronavirus and their effects on subsequent immune and inflammatory responses chu et al 57 compared the in vitro infection of human lung explants with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and demonstrated that both viruses can equally infect type-i and -ii pneumocytes plus alveolar macrophages although sars-cov2 had a better capacity to replicate in pulmonary tissues interestingly while sars-cov induced the expression of ifn-i ifn-ii and ifn-iii sars-cov-2 failed to induce any such immune mediators and was also less efficient in inducting other cytokines sars-cov induced the production of the 11 cytokines studied while sars-cov-2 induced only five il-6 mcp1 cxcl1 cxcl5 and cxcl10ip10 blanco-melo et al 55 studied the transcriptional response to sars-cov-2 compared to sar-cov mers-cov respiratory syncytial virus rsv parainfluenza virus 3 hpiv3 and influenza a virus iav in in vitro infection of respiratory cell lines experimental in vivo infection of ferrets and post-mortem lung samples of covid-19 patients their results show that sars-cov-2 induces a particular signature characterized by reduced ifn-i and ifn-iii responses and significant induction of multiple proinflammatory chemokines il-1b il-6 tnf and il1ra these findings were further supported by the increased serum levels of these molecules in covid-19 patients altogether these reports strongly suggest that sars-cov-2 differs from other coronaviruses in its capacity to replicate within the pulmonary tissue elude from the antiviral effects of ifn-i and ifn-iii activate innate responses and induce the production of the cytokines required for the recruitment of adaptive immunity cellsthe transition between innate and adaptive immune responses is critical for the clinical progress of sars-cov-2 infection it is at this crucial moment when immune regulatory events still poorly understood will lead to the development of either a protective immune response or an exacerbated inflammatory response 18 19 58 59 the protective response is t cell dependent with cd4 helping b cells geared toward the production of specific neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic cd8 cells capable of eliminating infected cells it is worth noting that 80 of the infiltrating cells in covid-19 are cd8 16 contrariwise a dysfunctional response unable to inhibit viral replication and elimination of the infected cells may result in an exacerbated inflammatory response leading possibly to a cytokine storm manifested clinically by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and systemic consequences such as disseminated intravascular coagulation in a sars-cov primate model of infection clay et al 60 showed that the virus replicated in the lungs until day 10 post-infection but surprisingly lung inflammation was more intense after virus clearance reaching its peak at day 14 and remaining so until day 28 these results suggest that an early phase dependent on virus replication does occur while a later viral-independent immune-dependent phase seems to be accompanied by an exacerbated inflammatory component the viral-independent phase has been explained by the inflammatory reaction secondary to ace2 inhibition or by an autoimmune phenomenon due to the epitope spreading caused by prolonged tissue destruction 20 61 it remains to be demonstrated whether a similar two-phase course also occurs in covid-19although t and b cells macrophages and dcs do not express ace2 some reports suggest that dc-sign may serve as a trans receptor for sars-cov on dcs which even when not infected may transfer the virus to other susceptible cells 22 23 62 recently vandakari and wilce 63 reported that cd26 an aminopeptidase involved in t cell activation may bind to the s protein of sars-cov-2 resulting in a non-productive t cell infection wang et al 64 reported that cd147 a protein of the immunoglobulins superfamily that induces the metalloproteinases of the extracellular matrix binds to the s1 domain and facilitates viral entrance into host cells the significance of non-productive t cells infection is not clear however it is tempting to speculate that it may be related to the lymphopenia found in patients with sars mers and covid-19 65 the binding of sars-cov-2 s protein to molecules like cd26 and cd147 which participate in t cell activation would suggest that a non-productive t cell infection may result in activation-induced cell death aicd mers-cov has been reported to induce t cells apoptosis 23 66 and there is evidence that t cells are functionally exhausted in patients with severe covid-19 67it is worth noting that the role of secretory immunoglobulin a siga in covid-19 has received little attention despite the fact that sars-cov-2 enters the body through the respiratory mucosa and siga is fundamental to the mucosal defenses furthermore several studies into covid-19 have shown the presence of serum iga against sars-cov-2 70 7779 and in preclinical studies with anti-sars vaccines administered either sub-lingually or intranasally the presence of neutralizing iga was demonstrated in bronchoalveolar lavages 8082 these findings support the importance of investigating the presence of siga in secretions of patients with covid-19 and defining its possible anti-viral neutralizing activity in respiratory tract mucosa 83an intriguing phenomenon that worries many clinicians and researchers is the antibody-dependent enhancement ade which could be linked to the severity of coronavirus infections and could possibly create difficulties with new vaccines 8486 ho et al 87 studying the antibody response in sars found that patients with more severe clinical courses had earlier and higher antibody responses and hypothesized that earlier responders may have had during the acute phase cross-reacting antibodies with non-sars coronaviruses jaume et al 88 and yip et al 89 demonstrated that anti-s antibodies while inhibiting viral entrance in permissive cells potentiated the infection by binding to igg fc receptor-ii positive fcrii cells like b cells and macrophages thus igg anti-s antibodies bound to fcrii on mononuclear phagocyte membranes enhance viral entrance through canonical viral-receptor pathways as recently shown for mers-cov 90 thereby activating these cells and inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokinesin order to understand covid-19 immunopathogenesis it is important to elucidate what lies at the root of immune response failure occurring in infected individuals resulting at times in deviation of the protective response into a dysfunctional program leading to cytokine release syndrome crs with severe inflammation and eventually a multi-systemic failure a better understanding of these events would contribute to the design of differential therapeutic approaches depending on the stage of the disease and to the delineation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers unfortunately there are no studies on the immune response in infected asymptomatic individuals which would allow a better characterization of the protective immune response as it occurs under the natural conditions of the infection process thus the present view is based on the comparison between patients with moderate and those with severe infections and also with those in the convalescent stage another aspect to be explored is the effect of previous exposure to other less virulent coronaviruses that may have cross-reactivity with more virulent ones additionally most of the studies have been done using blood samples which do not necessarily correlate with the events going on in the affected tissues fortunately several studies on bronchoalveolar lavage cells were published recently as will be discussed belowfrom an immunological point of view the wide clinical spectrum of covid-19 allows us to postulate different hypotheses some of them which have already been proven the remaining requiring more information and longer follow-up observation of recovered patients figure 1a shows diverse outcomes during the course of covid-19 and allows for an analysis of the immune response at each clinical stage however it must be noted that the immune response is conditioned by epidemiological variables such as intensity and duration of exposure to the virus and possible variations in viral virulence and on the host side genetic susceptibilityresistance and health conditions at the time of exposure the latter includes among other variables age and the existence of comorbidities that may directly affect the immune system 8 48despite its high infectivity not everyone exposed to sars-cov-2 becomes infected 15 the reasons for such resistance are still unknown it is possible that a small occasional inoculum does not reach the lower respiratory tract where susceptible target cells are found nevertheless as yet unidentified genetic conditions may also explain this per se resistance on this regard no association of sars with ace2 polymorphisms was found 91a central tenet of our view on covid-19 immunopathogenesis is that a protective immune response must be present in patients with asymptomatic and mild infections and even in some with moderate infections who do not progress to severe disease this response must be capable of inhibiting viral replication and eliminating the hosts infected cells with minimal tissue damage and low inflammatory manifestations figure 1b the adaptive response includes the existence of genetic conditions for viral antigen presentation by hla-i and ii molecules to cd8 and cd4 t cells respectively in this context grifoni et al 92 using a bioinformatic approach identified 241 candidate epitopes for hla-ii alleles in sars-cov-2 and 628 for class i alleles which may be bound by the more common hla alleles irrespective of their ethnic group the high number of epitopes also present in sars-cov 93 may explain the lack of a consistent association of sars with hla antigens 9498in patients with covid-19 the post mortem histopathological findings are similar to those reported in sars 99 and mers 100 xu et al 101 described bilateral diffuse alveolar damage dad with cellular fibromyxoid exudates pneumocytes desquamation and hyaline membrane formation multinucleated syncytial cells atypical enlarged pneumocytes with large nuclei amphophilic granular cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli as well as interstitial mononuclear infiltration zhang et al 47 also reported dad with denudation of the alveolar epithelia reactive type-ii pneumocyte hyperplasia intra-alveolar fibrinous exudate and loose fibrous plugs along with loose interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate also these authors using an anti-rp3 np of sars-cov-2 demonstrated the presence of the virus on alveolar epithelial cells including damaged desquamated cells within the alveolar space but its presence was only minimally detected on the blood vessels and the interstitium taken together the histopathological findings in covid-19 fatalities support that in addition to the direct cytopathic effect of sars-cov-2 on the pneumocytes an immunological response exists that includes a severe inflammatory reaction and extensive lung damage 22regarding cellular changes most studies show that lymphopenia although present in moderate infections is more pronounced in severe covid-19 17 108 and affects mainly t cells including cd4 th1 and tregs but particularly cd8 17 48 108110 also in severe covid-19 the number of circulating naive t cells increases and the number of memory t cells decreases 106 circulating cd8 in patients with severe covid 19 exhibited phenotypes associated with abnormal functionality cd8ifn-gm-csf and exhaustion tim3pd-1 108 or nkg2cd107aifn-grzb 67 the latter phenotype is also found in nk cells interestingly a negative correlation has been reported between serum levels of il-6 and il-8 and the perforin content of nk and cd8 cells which also negatively correlate with the increased number of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells mdsc 109 although the number of cd4 cells decreased they expressed activation markers such as cd69 cd38 cd44 and hla-dr including th17 cd4ccr6 cells 108 nk cells also decreased in both moderate and severe cases of the disease 107 110 monocytopenia is also found in covid-19 patients particularly in severe cases but the circulating monocytes belong mainly to the cd14cd16 inflammatory monocyte subset 108plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines are also increased in covid-19 but are higher in severe infections and includes il-2 il-2r il-6 il-7 il-8 il-10 ip10 mip1a and tnf- 5 17 106 109 110 high levels of plasmatic il-6 have been consistently reported in covid-19 and even appear to be associated with poor prognosis and risk of death 8 thus its measurement has been proposed as a good biomarker to monitor these patients liu et al 111 studied sixty covid-19 patients half of whom had a severe case of the disease and high il-6 levels baseline il-6 was higher in more severe cases and correlated with bilateral interstitial lung involvement and high body temperature as well as with other serum markers for acute inflammation of the 30 patients with severe disease 25 improved clinically and showed a significant decrease in il-6 levels while these levels increased in three patients with disease progression coomes et al 112 performed a meta-analysis of 16 papers that included 10798 chinese patients in order to test the evidence that il-6 levels correlate with covid-19 severity and the effectiveness of treatment with tocilizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody against il-6 receptor all covid-19 patients had increased levels of serum il-6 but it was 29-fold higher in patients with severe covid-19 twenty-one patients treated with tocilizumab improved clinically with no adverse effects or deaths also xu et al 113 reported very promising results using tocilizumab treatment in 20 patients with severe covid-19 all patients improved remarkably within a few days and all were discharged from the icu within an average of 15 daysduring the course of covid-19 infection viral replication immune response and inflammatory reaction are dynamic events that can change rapidly resulting in different outcomes several reports have addressed these changes thevarajan et al 114 reported the case of a patient with mild to moderate infection that was clinically virologically and immunologically followed over the course of the disease including her recovery 13 days after the initiation of symptoms and through to day 20 at which point she had recovered the virus was detected on days 4 and 5 via nasopharyngeal swabs but was undetectable thereafter igm and igg anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies progressively increase from day 7 through to day 20 circulating antibody-secreting b cells cd3cd19cd27hicd38hi appeared in the blood at the time of viral clearance day 7 peaked on day 8 and remained high through to day 20 follicular helper t cells tfh cd4cxcr5icospd-1 were also detected on day 7 and continued increasing through to day 20 activated cytotoxic cd8 t cells cd8cd38hla-dr were also present on day 7 increased through to day 9 and then decreased through to day 20 although with values higher than in healthy controls there was no increase in inflammatory cd14cd16 monocytes nor in activated nk cd3cd56hla-dr cells regarding serum cytokines of the 17 pro-inflammatory cytokines studied only low levels of mcp1ccl2 were found on days 79 this case is interesting since there are very few studies on patients with mild infections and because igm and igg antibodies antibody secreting b cells cd4 tfh cells and activated cytotoxic cd8 cells were shown to be circulating before resolution of the symptomsong et al 115 compared the blood transcriptional profile of three patients in early phases of infection -one of whom evolved to a severe disease- with 10 healthy volunteers the main findings in the patient who progressed to severe disease was that only il-1a and il-1b preceded the nadir of the respiratory function and that the expression of most inflammatory genes particularly il-6 il-2 tnf- and ifna113 peaked thereafter also in this patient transcripts associated with hla cd4 and cd8 t cell activation were diminished while in the other two patients who did not progress to severe disease the transcription profile was comparable to that of healthy controls the authors suggest that in the first case the decreased t cell activation may have helped the inflammatory response by the il-1 pathway while in the other two cases the low inflammatory response allowed a moderate t cell responseone of the risk factors most strongly associated with severe covid-19 and death is advanced age immunosenescence present in the elderly affects innate immunity 116 but mainly t cell-dependent adaptive responses 117120 in addition experimental evidence suggests that elderly mice have increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and that their alveolar macrophages are refractory to activation by ifn- 121 this finding is relevant since the protective response that eliminates the virus depends on cytotoxic cd8 cells and th1 responses with ifn- playing an important role in both responses as demonstrated in sars and mers 122 123increased susceptibility in the elderly to present with severe covid-19 forms contrasts with the lower frequency of these forms in children and young adults ludvigsson 124 reviewed 45 publications on covid-19 and found that 15 of the patients are children who although they present with fever and respiratory symptoms experience milder symptoms and among whom death was extremely rare the increase in inflammatory markers and lymphocytopenia were also less common in children brodin 125 postulated the following three explanations for the milder covid-19 presentation in childrenfindings in blood do not necessarily explain the events occurring in tissues directly affected by the infection thus studies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids balf are very relevant table 2 xiong et al 127 used rna-seq to study balfs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc transcriptome from three covid-19 patients unfortunately their clinical conditions were not reported and from three healthy subjects the balf cells in these patients expressed 9609 genes 679 of which were up-regulated and 325 down-regulated as opposed to controls in pbmc 15726 genes were expressed with 707 up-regulated and 316 down-regulated balf cells from patients showed a differential expression of genes related to viral invasion and replication viral rna was detected in balfs of all three patients such as membrane-associated proteins endoplasmic reticulum and viral transcription in contrast pbmcs showed increased expression of genes related to complement activation immunoglobulins and b cell-mediated responses while some genes corresponded to the acute inflammatory response the down-regulated genes in patients balf were mostly related to activation of the immune response comparison of the cytokine genes showed that in balfs the genes for il-10 ccl2mcp-1 together with its ccr2 receptor cxcl10ip-10 ccl3mip-1a together with its ccr5 receptor and ccl4mip1b were differentially up-regulated another relevant finding was that in pbmc genes related to autophagy apotopsis and p53 pathways were up-regulated a finding that could be related to the lymphopenia detected in the three patients interestingly il-6 transcripts were not increased in pbmcs although the patients had high plasma levels of such cytokine suggesting that circulating il-6 could have been produced in the lungs either by alveolar epithelial cells or by recruited inflammatory cellsin another study liao et al 128 used scrna-seq and sctcr-seq to determine balf cells transcriptional signature in three patients with severe and another three with moderate covid-19 and compared them with eight healthy subjects previously studied their main findings were related to macrophages and cd8 cells macrophages were predominant in balfs from patients with severe infection with a minor proportion of t and nk cells as compared with patients with moderate disease macrophages were classified in 22 clusters according to their expression of fcn1 monocyte-derived spp1 pro-fibrotic and fabp4 alveolar macrophages these genes were differentially expressed both among the two groups of patients and the healthy controls fabp4 was preferentially expressed in healthy controls and in patients with moderate covid-19 while fcn1 and spp1 were expressed in patients with severe covid-19 further macrophages classification resulted in four groups group 1 fcn1hi only group 2 fcn1lospp1 group 3 fcn1spp1 and group 4 fabp4 group 1 macrophages expressed genes associated with inflammatory monocytes group 2 expressed chemokines and interferon stimulated genes isg group 3 genes related with immune regulation and profibrotic events and group 4 were alveolar macrophage typical genes according to the investigators these results suggest that during sars-cov-2 infection inflammatory monocytes fcn1 are recruited from the circulation into the lungs where they differentiate into spp1 macrophages constituents of the severe inflammatory reaction analysis of the balf transcriptome showed that t and nk cells are increased in covid-19 patients compared to healthy controls which according to their gene expression can be classified in nk cd8 cd4 tregs and proliferating cells an important finding was that genes related to activating molecules migration calcium signaling and effector molecules were highly expressed by cd8 cells in patients with moderate infection compared with patients with severe covid-19 this further supports the role of cd8 cells in the elimination of the virus and their subsequent protective immunity in contrast patients with severe disease had a higher expression of genes related to proliferation energy generation and initiation of translation these results suggest that in patients with moderate infection cd8 cells are more differentiated and efficient while in severe infection t cells are in a proliferative stage additionally the finding that the tcr repertoire is higher in cd8 than in cd4 cells suggests a larger clonal expansion of the cd8 cells taking part in the resolution of the infectionzhou et al 129 used metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the balf of eight covid-19 patients compared to 146 community-acquired pneumonia patients and 20 healthy controls their results show that in balf from covid-19 the differentially expressed genes degs included up-regulated proinflammatory chemokines genes such as cxcl17 cxcl8 and cxcl2 as well as the cxcr2 receptor critical to neutrophil recruitment and ccl2 and ccl7 needed for monocyte recruitment these authors also found that covid-19 patients up-regulated il-1 antiviral interferon stimulated genes isgs and genes related to the il-17 tnf and nf-b signaling pathways in addition the cellular analysis showed an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr in patients with covid-19 compared to patients with other pneumoniastaken together findings in balf demonstrate both a highly dysregulated innate and adaptive immune response in the affected lungs of patients with covid-19just 5 months after the initiation of the covid-19 pandemic in china which extended quickly worldwide to greatly impact public health and economies the amount of information gathered on all aspects of the infection and the celerity with which the international scientific community has shared such information is truly amazing however given the haste to publish results many manuscripts are in repositories and still waiting for peer review a note of caution is therefore in order if such information is to be used in defining new diagnostic therapeutic or prophylactic protocols it is also important to consider the brief amount of time elapsed since the beginning of the pandemic during which time it has not been possible to gather sufficient results from in vitro and experimental animal models to ensure further understanding of covid-19s biology even when considering these limitations the information provided by the papers reviewed herein strongly supports quantitative and qualitative differences in the immune responses of those infected with sars-cov-2 which seem to correlate with the clinical manifestations of covid-19 although studies of asymptomatic infected individuals are lacking the immunological profiles of patients with moderate infections indicate a protective t cell-dependent response in contrast to patients with severe disease who exhibit an exacerbated systemic inflammation with signs of t cells exhaustionthe following fundamental aspects need to be defined through close collaboration between clinicians and basic researchers with strong support from the public and private financial agenciesfinally it is important to remember what many investigators of sars and mers have written in their publications long before the emergency of covid-19 pandemics what will be learned from this pandemic must be used to prevent future coronavirus epidemicslg wrote and edited the manuscriptthe author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 firstly found in wuhan in the hubei province of china in december 2019 has rapidly spread worldwide becoming a global public health emergency on 11th march 2020 the world health organization who declared covid-19 a pandemic as of 28 april 2020 who reports more than 28 million confirmed cases and 198 842 deaths worldwide who 2020 httpscovid19whoint after the isolation of sars-cov-2 the viral genome was sequenced thus facilitating diagnostic testing epidemiologic tracking as well as investigations on potential preventive and therapeutic strategies in the management of covid-19 to date despite the intense scientific effort demonstrated by more than 600 clinical trials currently underway typing sars-cov-2 on clinicaltrialsgov no vaccines or effective drugs have been approved to prevent or treat covid-19 and the current standard care is supportive treatment therefore based on the fast and global spread of the virus urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop effective therapies within this context treatments addressing the immunopathology of the infection have become a major focusthe new human-infecting sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna-enveloped virus belonging to cov family1 among the six covs pathogenic to humans four of them have been associated with mild respiratory symptoms2 while two of them sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov mers-cov whose epidemic outbreaks took place in 2002 and 2012 respectively caused severe respiratory diseases in affected individuals2 sars-cov-2 is the seventh identified cov and after sars-cov and mers-cov the third zoonotic virus of covs that has been transmitted from animals to humans via an intermediate mammalian host34 in particular based on genetic analysis chinese horseshoe bats have been proposed to serve as natural reservoir hosts for sars-cov-2 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov46 moreover genomic analysis indicates that sars-cov-2 is in the same beta-cov clade as sars-cov and mers-cov1 in particular sars-cov-2 has been observed to share almost 80 of the genome with sars-cov167 and almost all encoded proteins of sars-cov-2 are homologous to sars-cov proteins1 in contrast sars-cov-2 has been found to be more distant from mers-cov with only 50 identity1 moreover the entry of sars-cov-2 into human host cells has been found to rely on the same receptor as sars-cov the surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is expressed in the type ii surfactant-secreting alveolar cells of the lungs89 consistently despite amino acid variations at specific key residues homology modeling revealed a structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-21 however further studies are necessary to compare sars-cov and sars-cov-2 affinities to ace2 receptor that might explain the increased transmissibility and greater virulence of sars-cov-2 compared with sars-cov8two independent groups provided key insights into the first step of sars-cov2 infection by demonstrating that ace2 host receptor is required for host cell entry of sars-cov-2810 noteworthy the expression of ace2 receptors is not only restricted to the lung and extrapulmonary spread of sars-cov in ace-expressing tissues has been demonstrated1113 hence the same pattern may be expected for sars-cov-2 with most of human tissues such as oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract kidney heart blood vessels expressing ace2 receptors particularly prone to sars-cov-2 infection1415 the viral entry of sars-cov-2 has been further found to be prevented by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular host type 2 transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 camostat mesylate8 priming of the envelope-located trimeric spike s protein by host proteases which cleave at the s1s2 and the s2 sites has been described as a fundamental step for viral entry and the host protease tmprss2 emerged as a key cellular factor necessary for the priming of s protein and for the consequent membrane fusion and viral internalization by endocytosis in the pulmonary epithelium8 hence tmprss2 has been proposed as a potential target for clinical intervention68 and its inhibitor camostat mesylate approved for human use in japan to treat pancreatic inflammation has attracted the attention of the scientific community currently a randomized placebo-controlled phase iia trial is investigating the use of camostat mesylate nct04321096 and is expected to run until december 2020 whereas another independent trial will start in june 2020 to evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesilate in combination with hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with moderate covid-19 infection nct04338906a detailed analysis of additional mechanisms of cellular viral infection for sars-cov-2 is still missing and would be fundamental to identify further potential biological substrates to targetseveral studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in covid-19 patients in particular lymphocytopenia and a modulation in total neutrophils are common hallmarks and seem to be directly correlated with disease severity and death618 in patients with severe covid-19 a marked decrease in the levels of absolute number of circulating cd4 cells cd8 cells b cells and natural killers nk cells161719 as well as a decrease in monocytes eosinophils and basophils has been reported1921 in addition most of patients with severe covid-19 displayed significantly increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg il-6 il-1 il-2 il-8 il-17 g-csf gm-csf ip-10 mcp-1 ccl3 and tnf2022 although no direct evidence for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involvement in lung pathology in covid-19 has been reported an increase in serum cytokine and chemokine levels as well as in neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio nlr in sars-cov-2 infected patients has been correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcomes suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in covid-19 pathogenesis20 moreover a recent multicenter retrospective cohort study analyzing data from the early risk stratification of novel coronavirus pneumonia ers-covid-19 study chictr2000030494 showed that patients with covid-19 had elevated high-sensitivity c-reactive protein hs-crp and procalcitonin serum levels two major inflammation markers associated with high risks of mortality and organ injury23noteworthy mers-cov has been demonstrated to infect thp-1 cells human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells and sars-cov to directly infect macrophages and t cells24 thereby inducing delayed but elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines2526 however ace2 receptor is only minimally expressed in monocytes macrophages and t cells in the lung hence the mechanism by which sars-cov directly infects immune cells is still unknown27 taking into account the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it is likely that also this latter may infect monocytes and macrophages by a mechanism that has to be still unveiled in this regard it is possible that the virus may be capable to bind other specific receptors andor other mechanisms of viral entry mode can be exploited by the virusas far as concerns the adaptive immunity the novel sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated to mainly affect lymphocyte counting and balance in particular li et al reported that compared with survivors dead covid-19 patients showed lower percentage and count in cd3 cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes populations strong predictive values for in-hospital mortality organ injury and severe pneumonia23in a retrospective single-center study enrolling a cohort of 452 patients with covid-19 in wuhan patients with severe covid-19 displayed a significantly lower number of total t cells both helper t cells and suppressor t cells20 in particular among helper t cells a decrease in regulatory t cells with a more pronounced reduction according to the severity of the cases and in memory t cells has been observed whereas the percentage of nave t cells was found increased20 notably nave and memory t cells are essential immune components whose balance is crucial for maintaining a highly efficient defensive response nave t cells enable the defenses against new and previously unrecognized infection by a massive and tightly coordinated release of cytokines whereas memory t cells mediate antigen-specific immune response a dysregulation in their balance favoring nave t cells activity compared with regulatory t cells could highly contribute to hyperinflammation a reduction in memory t cells on the other hand could be implicated in covid-19 relapse since a number of recurrences has been reported in recovered cases of covid-19628 these data are consistent with results reported by tan et al29 overall the lymphopenia observed in covid-19 patients may depend on the fact that sars-cov-2 may directly infect lymphocytes minimally expressing ace2 leading to lymphocyte death or alternatively may directly damage lymphatic organs since they express ace2 receptors29 however to date no data are available on lymph nodes and spleen shrinking and lymphocytes functionalities hence such speculations need to be further investigated to confirm these hypothesesas far as concerns b cells by using single-cell rna sequencing to characterize the transcriptome landscape of blood immune cell subsets during the recovery stage of covid-19 wen et al30 found significant changes in b cells in particular while the nave b cells have been reported to be decreased the plasma cells have been found remarkably increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells30 moreover several new b cell-receptor changes have been identified eg ighv323 and ighv3730 in addition isotypes including ighv315 ighv330 and igkv311 previously used for virus vaccine development have been confirmed30 the strongest pairing frequencies ighv323-ighj4 has been suggested to indicate a monoclonal state associated with sars-cov-2 specificity30 moreover given the pivotal role of b cells in the control of infections tracking the antibody seroconversion response is an important process for the clinical evaluation of infections in covid-19 patients while serum samples from patients with covid-19 showed no cross-binding to the s1 subunit of the sars-cov spike antigen some cross-reactivity of serum samples has been observed from patients with covid-19 to nucleocapsid antigens of sars-cov31 interestingly this study reports that 968 of tested patients achieved seroconversion of igg or igm within 20 days after symptom onset with a titer plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion31 moreover 100 of patients had positive virus-specific igg approximately 1719 days after symptom onset31 instead 941 patients showed positive virus-specific igm approximately 2022 days after symptom onset31in addition to these observations about immunity a critical aspect has to be raised concerning the ability to escape from anti-viral host defenses viral evasion of host immune response is in fact believed to play a major role in disease severity32 as an example sars-cov and mers-cov escape and suppress the signaling pathways mediated by type i interferon ifn a key cytokine secreted by virus-infected cells to enroll nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral immune defenses33 based on genomic sequence comparison and on partial identity of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov it is speculative that sars-cov-2 can adopt similar strategies to modulate the host innate immune response thus evading immune detection and dampening human defensesmounting clinical evidence from severe covid-19 patients suggests that extensive changes in the serum levels of several cytokines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of covid-19223435 such hypercytokinemia the so-called cytokine storm has been proposed as one of the key leading factors that trigger the pathological processes leading to plasma leakage vascular permeability and disseminated vascular coagulation observed in covid-19 patients and accounting for life-threatening respiratory symptoms17 huang et al16 found that plasma concentrations of il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 basic fgf g-csf gm-csf ifn- ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 mip-1 pdgf tnf and vegf were higher in both icu intensive care unit patients and non-icu patients than in healthy adults moreover when comparing icu and non-icu patients plasma concentrations of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 and tnf were higher in icu patients than non-icu patients thus indicating that the cytokine storm might be correlated with disease severity16 another study on a small set of patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia found 15 cytokines ifn-2 ifn- il-1ra il-2 4 7 10 12 and 17 chemokine ip-10 as well as g-csf and m-csf associated with lung injury based on murray score35 evidence from literature indicates that the cytokine storm observed in covid-19 resembles that occurring in cytokines release syndrome crs a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and in secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh an hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure mainly induced by viral infections2236 therefore as detailed below existing pharmaceutical modulators of cytokines might be repurposed as therapeutic strategy to attenuate the hypercytokinemia in covid-19 patientsinterestingly gou et al37 recently reported that the disruption of gut microbiome features by host and environmental factors may predispose healthy individuals to abnormal inflammatory response observed in covid-19 in particular the authors constructed a blood proteomic risk score for the prediction of covid-19 progression to clinically severe phase and observed that core gut microbiota features were significantly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in a set of 366 individuals using a machine learning model37 specifically bacteroides genus streptococcus genus and clostridiales order have been negatively correlated with most of the tested inflammatory cytokines whereas ruminococcus genus blautia genus and lactobacillus genus have been positively associated37 moreover fecal metabolomics analysis indicated some potential amino acid-related pathways eg aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis pathway arginine biosynthesis pathway and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway that correlate core microbial features with host inflammation among 987 participants37 thus the core intestinal microbiological characteristics along with its related metabolites should be further investigated as potential predictors for the individual susceptibility to covid-19 progression and severity and might represent potential targets for the prevention of susceptible populations as well as for the development of therapeutic approaches to manage covid-19the transcription factor nf-b is a critical regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity41 under basal conditions nf-b is retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory proteins ibs a variety of cellular stimuli including pathogens induce ib phosphorylation ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome thereby promoting nf-b nuclear translocation41 in the nucleus nf-b induces the transcription of a wide spectrum of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines stress-response proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins nf-b activity is essential for survival and activation and for initiating and propagating optimal immune responses42 by contrast the constitutive activation of the nf-b pathway is often associated with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma notably the exacerbation of nf-b activation has been reported to be implicated in lung inflammatory immunopathology induced by respiratory viruses including sars-cov4344 moreover wang and collaborators demonstrated that in murine macrophages cell line raw2647 the exposure to recombinant sars-cov spike protein induced a massive protein release of il-6 and tnf in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in the supernatants and that such increase in il-6 and tnf secretion relies on the activation of nf-b signaling pathway45 in fact sars-cov spike protein has been associated with an increase in ib degradation an essential step required for the activation of nf-b signaling pathway45 accordingly transfection with dominant-negative nik which inhibits nf-b activation produced a strong reduction in spike protein il-6 and tnf release in raw2647 cells thus demonstrating that nf-b is required for the induction of il-6 and tnf by sars-cov spike protein45 such in vitro data were consistent with results obtained in vivo where treatments with drugs inhibiting nf-b activation such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester cape bay 117082 and parthenolide reduced inflammation by suppressing the mrna expression of tnf cxcl2 and mcp-1 in the lung of sars-cov-infected mice moreover pharmacological inhibition of nf-b protected against pulmonary pathology and enhanced mice survival after sars-cov infection43in line with these findings smits et al demonstrated that sars-cov-infected aged macaques show in the lungs an increase in nf-b nuclear translocation as a result of nf-b activation and developed a stronger host response to virus infection compared with young adult macaques with a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes mainly regulated by nf-b44taken together these data suggest that nf-b inhibition might be an effective strategy to counteract pathogenic sars-cov however targeting nf-b is an approach strongly limited by intrinsic pathways complexity molecules blocking nf-b lack for specificity and interfere with nf-b physiological roles in cellular homeostasis resulting in increased risk of undesired side effects such as a broad suppression of innate immunity46 moreover within the context of viral infection a major limitation of targeting nf-b signaling depends on the ability of viruses to efficiently escape by encoding proteins specifically blocking this pathway46 thus a promising strategy may rely on directly targeting the downstream effectors of the pathway such as tnf whose expression is mainly controlled by nf-b transcriptional activity while tnf is known to play a key role in the coordination and development of the inflammatory response especially in the acute phase long-lasting and excessive production of tnf may become less effective by possibly altering tnftnf receptor signaling threshold which after an initial wave of nf-b activation favors sustained basal nf-b activity47 in addition despite many other pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators are involved in the cytokine storm specific blockade of tnf has been reported to be clinically effective in several pathological conditions accordingly tnf blockers such as infliximab and adalimumab have been successfully used for the treatment of several immune-mediated disorders such as psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel diseases and ankylosing spondylitis4849 hence anti-tnf monoclonal antibodies are likely to attenuate inflammatory processes occurring in covid-19 reducing the release of other inflammatory-exacerbating mediators indeed when an anti-tnf is administrated in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis it has been demonstrated to induce a rapid decrease of a broad spectrum of cytokines eg il-6 and il-1 as well as of others acute-phase related proteins and vascular permeability factor5052furthermore the envelope viral spike protein of sars-cov has been found to promote the activity of tnf-converting enzyme tace-dependent shedding of ace2 receptor which is a fundamental step for virus entry into the cell53 thus tnf blockers represent effective therapeutic tools to counteract sars-cov infection by exerting a dual mechanism of action attenuation of inflammation and inhibition of viral infection45 however warnings about the potential increased risk of bacterial and fungal superinfections due to anti-tnf therapy have to be taken into account54 taking into account the sequence similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and the strong limitation in directly inhibiting nf-b to date a clinical trial investigating adalimumab for the management of covid-19 has been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry chictr2000030089 and is expected to run until august 2020 however further investigations concerning the use and safety of tnf-blockers in covid-19 patients are urgently neededin addition concerning a potential intervention on nf-b signaling pathway serine protease inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases eg camostat mesylate nafamostat mesylate gabexate mesylate ulinastatin used for the treatment of pancreatitis disseminated intravascular coagulation and anticoagulant for hemodialysis5556 have been found to inhibit viral replication5758 and to attenuate inflammatory processes in different pathological contexts such as asthma chronic allergic pulmonary inflammation and inflammatory myocardial injury5962 for instance nafamostat mesylate and gabexate mesylate have been demonstrated to attenuate allergen-induced airway inflammation and eosinophilia in mouse model of allergic asthma61 thus reducing mast cell activation eosinophils infiltrations in the lung and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-driven il-4 and tnf production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid61 furthermore treatment with nafamostat mesylate downregulated the expression of il-1 tnf il-6 eotaxin inducible no synthase inos cd86 and nf-b activation but enhanced the expression of il-12 and il-10 in dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-driven il-4 and tnf production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid61 moreover gabexate mesylate has been found to inhibit lps-induced tnf production in human monocytes by blocking both nf-b and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation63 thus the pharmacological profile of serine protease inhibitors as inhibitors of complement pathways and broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents provide a strong rationale for their use in the management of covid-19 however the specific mechanism of action through which serine protease inhibitors induce their anti-inflammatory effects is still unknownfirst discovered as the primary mediator of intracellular signaling induced by ifn in hematopoietic and immune cells the jakstat signaling is a key pathway transducing extracellular signals transmitted by a large number of cytokines lymphokines and growth factors in particular a subset of cytokines employs the jakstat signaling pathway in order to induce their biological effects notably one of the major activators of jakstat signaling is the cytokine il-6 which has been reported to be dramatically increased in covid-19 patients2022 with a strong implication in acute inflammation and cytokine storm in particular il-6 has been reported to activate numerous cell types expressing the glycoprotein gp130 receptor and the membrane-bound il-6 receptor as well as a soluble form of il-6 receptor interacting with gp130 thereby promoting the downstream activation of jakstat signaling64 in turn the activation of jakstat pathway has been reported to stimulate the production of il-665 such signaling pathway has been reported to be aberrantly activated in patients with chronic inflammation conditions such as arthritis rheumatoid and it is likely that its excessive overactivation may also occur in covid-19 patients thereby exacerbating the host inflammatory response noteworthy chronic elevation of circulating il-6 has been widely recognized as a predictor for increased risk of cardiovascular events6667 consistently il-6 is produced from several tissues including activated macrophages and endothelial and smooth muscle cells where it promotes the secretion of other cytokines and among others it stimulates mcp-1 secretion from macrophages to promote atherogenesis68 increases the expression of cell adhesion molecules6970 and stimulates the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells71 thus the abnormal increase in il-6 levels may be implicated at least in part in the occurrence cardiovascular diseases eg coronary atherosclerosis inflammation in the vascular system resulting in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis observed in covid-19 patients72 accordingly the synthesis and secretion of il-6 has been demonstrated to be induced by angiotensin ii which is locally produced by the inflamed vessels in a jakstat-dependent manner73 in particular angiotensin ii binding to angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1 receptor has been found to activate jakstat pathway and to promote the downstream production of il-67374 increased angiotensin ii enhances il-6 production in at1jakstat-dependent manner thus establishing a positive inflammatory feedback loop interestingly the spike protein of sars-cov has been demonstrated to downregulate ace2 expression thus resulting in over-production of angiotensin ii by the related enzyme ace7576 in a similar way it could be hypothesized that sars-cov-2 may downregulate ace2 receptors thus leading to an over-production of angiotensin ii in turn enhancing il-6 production in at1jakstat-dependent manner and ultimately driving to vascular inflammation and lung injury clinical signatures of covid-19 fig 2 moreover the angiotensin iiat1 receptor axis has been reported to also activate both nf-b and adam1777 notably an important substrate for adam17 is ace2 whose cleavage by adam17 has been reported to inactivate it enhancing angiotensin ii retention thus leading to hypertension cardiovascular remodeling and other types of pathophysiology associated with enhancement of the renin-angiotensin system77 beside its implication in the shedding of ace2 receptor fundamental for virus entry53 adam17 induction has been found to process the membrane form of il-6 receptor  il-6r to the soluble form sil-6r followed by the gp130-mediated activation of stat3 via the sil-6r-il-6 complex in a variety of il-6r-negative non-immune cells78 the activation of stat3 has been reported to be required for the complete induction of nf-b pathway78 thus sars-cov-2 infection may activate both nf-b and stat3 signaling which in turn can promote the il-6 amplifier mechanism required for the hyper-activation of nf-b by stat3 thereby inducing multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases78 the il-6 amplifier promotes the production and secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il-6 and the recruitment of lymphoid and myeloid cells sustaining the il-6 amplifier-driven positive feedback loop as proposed by hirano and murakami79 fig 2 furthermore the metalloprotease adam17 has been found to mediate angiotensin ii-induced egfr epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation by generating the mature form of heparin-binding egf-like growth factor in vascular smooth muscle cells thus leading to vascular remodeling77 notably egfr transactivation is critical for angiotensin ii-mediated cardiovascular complications77 in this regard the egfr kinase inhibitor erlotinib has been recently repurposed for the treatment of covid-19 based on its capability to reduce the infectivity of a wide range of viruses8082 beside its antiviral activity the implication of egfr transactivation in cardiovascular complications represent another theoretical foundation for the use of erlotinib in the management of covid-19 patientsmoreover given the importance of angiotensin iiat1 receptor axis the attempt to use angiotensin ii-receptor blockers as a therapeutic benefit in covid-19 by targeting the host response to the virus has been made83 however their use needs to be deepened since ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii-receptor blockers have been suggested to further increase the risk of covid-19 infection by up-regulating ace284 whether patients affected by covid-19 and hypertension taking an ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii-receptor blockers should switch to another antihypertensive drug is still a matter of debate and further evidence is requiredsince il-6 appears a key driver of cytokine storm and of its consequent detrimental effects monoclonal antibodies against il-6 such as tocilizumab and sarilumab have been also proposed to dampen this process tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody il-6 receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and crs has been used in clinical practice in order to manage severe cases of covid-19 and it has been included in the current chinese national treatment guidelines httpswwwchinalawtranslatecomwp-contentuploads202003who-translationpdf to date 40 clinical trials typing covid-19 and tocilizumab on clinicaltrialsgov and clinicaltrialsregistereu are underway to test tocilizumab alone or in combination in patients with covid-19 moreover 18 clinical trials typing covid-19 and tocilizumab on clinicaltrialsgov and clinicaltrialsregistereu will study the efficacy and safety of another il-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with covid-19beside monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting il-6 approved drugs inhibiting il-6jakstat signaling may represent a valuable tool in particular jak signaling inhibitors such as baricitinib fedratinib and ruxolitinib  approved for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis  have been reported to attenuate the host inflammatory response associated with massive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release85 based on this anti-inflammatory effect they are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines typically observed in patients with covid-1980 among them baricitinib a selective inhibitor of jak 1 and 2 has been predicted by crystallographic studies to inhibit two members of the numb-associated kinase family such as ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 and cyclin g-associated kinase gak thus hindering viral endocytosis into lung cells at the concentration approved for the treatment of arthritis rheumatoid86 however despite such undeniable advantages the repurposing of baricitinib and in general of jak inhibitors for the management of covid-19 is debated in particular concerns arise mainly from evidence reporting that the activation of jakstat pathway mediated by ifns is required for the induction of many ifn-regulated genes playing a pivotal role as innate early defense system against viral infections the defensive role of jakstat pathway is corroborated by evidence demonstrating that the majority of virus have developed escaping strategies such as the production of viral-encoded factors blocking this pathway which are recognized as crucial determinants of virulence87 therefore inhibition of jakstat signaling is likely to produce an impairment of ifn-related antiviral response exacerbating sars-cov-2 infection however since several benefits such as the blockage of virus entry and the attenuation of host excessive inflammatory response as well as vascular and lung damage provide a strong rationale for the use of baricitinib in the management of covid-19 patients the balance between positive and negative aspects of jakstat signaling inhibition has to be still drawn upto date several clinical trials are testing the efficacy and safety jak inhibitors in covid-19 patients typing covid-19 and jak inhibitors on clinicaltrialsgov and clinicaltrialsregistereuthe sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p 1 has emerged as a crucial signaling lipid regulator of inflammation and immune response including lymphocyte trafficking vascular integrity and cytokine and chemokine production88 beside s1p role of second messenger during inflammation most of s1p effects on innate and adaptive immunity are mediated by its binding to five g-protein-coupled receptors s1prs15 which are differentially expressed in tissues88 among them s1p1 receptor is ubiquitously expressed and coupled with a g inhibitory protein89 the activation of s1p1 receptor is associated with raserk pi3kaktenos and plcca2 downstream pathways89 notably under physiological and pathological conditions the s1ps1pr1 axis has been demonstrated to regulate the trafficking and migration of numerous types of immune cells including t and b lymphocytes nk cells dendritic cells88 moreover the s1p1 receptor signaling pathways have been reported to inhibit the pathological damage induced by the host innate and adaptive immune responses thus attenuating the cytokine storm observed in influenza virus infection40 in particular teijaro et al40 demonstrated that in mice infected with awisconsinwslh3493909 influenza virus s1p1 receptor subtype regulates a crucial signaling loop fundamental for the initiation of cytokine storm in respiratory endothelial cells the administration of s1p1 agonist blunted cytokine storm by significantly inhibiting secretion of cytokines and chemokines associated with influenza virus-induced pathology such as ifn- ccl2 il-6 tnf and ifn-40 notably in endothelial cells suppression of early innate immune responses through s1p1 signaling has been found to decrease mortality during influenza virus infection in mice40 interestingly in a later work by the same group activation of s1p1 signaling has been demonstrated to block cytokine and chemokine production as well as immune cell activation and recruitment in the lungs of mice infected with the h1n1 wsn strain of influenza virus90 moreover s1p1 agonism has been found to reduce cytokine storm independently of tlr3 and tlr7 signaling as well as of multiple endosome and cytosolic innate pathogen-sensing pathways90 in contrast s1p1r agonism has been found to suppress cytokine and chemokine production by targeting myd88 myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88trif tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing ifn- signaling two common actors with nf-b pathway90 however s1p1r agonism is likely to modulate other signaling pathways that have not yet identifiedthus based on the effects of s1p receptor signaling on multiple immunological processes indicating such pathway a promising for the modulation of harmful inflammatory responses the application of therapies targeting s1p and s1p signaling may be repurposed for immune-mediated disorders and inflammatory conditions such as covid-19 for instance sp1 agonists approved for multiple sclerosis such as fingolimod might be used as therapeutic tools to dampen cytokine and chemokine responses in those patients displaying excessive immune responses to date only one non-randomized phase ii clinical trial is underway to establish the efficacy of fingolimod in the treatment of covid-19 nct04280588 typing covid-19 and fingolimod on clinicaltrialsgovthe covid-19 pandemic induced by the novel sars-cov-2 represents one of the greatest global public health emergencies since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918 and provides an unprecedented challenge for the identification of both preventive and therapeutic drugs in particular vaccines and effective therapeutics to tackle this novel virus are urgently needed fortunately in the last decade vaccine technology has significantly evolved with the development of several rna and dna vaccine candidates licensed vectored vaccines recombinant proteins and cell culture-based vaccines for many indications91 moreover given the similarities of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov the ideal target for the vaccine the spike s protein on the surface of the virus required for viral entry has been quickly identified providing a target antigen to incorporate into advanced vaccine platforms thus antibodies specifically targeting the s protein can block the binding of sars-cov-2 to the host ace2 receptor thus neutralizing the virus however given the lesson learned from sars and mers the development of the vaccine against sars-cov-2 is likely to be an uphill road with several obstacles in fact several vaccines for sars-cov including recombinant s protein-based vaccines have been already developed and tested in animal models but many did not produce sterilizing immunity in animal models andor induced severe side effects such as lung and liver damage9293 to date no human cov vaccines have been approved so far moreover to complicate this scenario it has to be still unveiled whether infection with covs induces long-lived antibody response protecting against the risk of relapsing infections thus scientific community has to overcome several issues for the development of an effective and safe sars-cov-2 vaccine in this regard ling et al recently detected sars-cov-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in 8 covid-19 patients recently become virus-free and consequently discharged94 in addition the neutralizing antibody titers have been significantly correlated with the numbers of nucleocapsid protein-specific t cells94 such evidence indicates that both b and t cells cooperate to protect the host from viral infection notably despite the small sample size this study laid a theoretical foundation for the diagnosis of infectious diseases the tracing of past infections as well as the development of therapeutic antibody drugs and the design of an effective vaccine consistently long et al reported acute antibody responses to sars-cov-2 in a cohort of 285 patients with covid-1931 in particular 19 days after symptom onset 100 of patients have been tested positive for antiviral igg and seroconversion for igg and igm have been reported to occur simultaneously or sequentially31 thus serological testing might be useful to identify suspected patients with negative rt-pcr results as well as asymptomatic infections31however the speed at which sars-cov-2 is spreading has emphasized the urgent need to identify alternative therapeutic strategies in order to contain viral infection and to attenuate the excessive host immune response during the lag of vaccine availability especially in a scenario where the virus may become endemic and recurrent seasonal epidemics may occur in this regard several antiviral drugs such as remdesivir lopinavir and ritonavir are currently tested in several clinical trials either alone or in combination and compassionate use of these drugs has already been reported for sars-cov-29596 however antiviral drugs might select for mutational escape thus rendering this therapeutic approach ineffective moreover still unconfirmed reports indicate sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as prophylactic agent97 with evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases98 however their use needs further evidence and clinical evaluation chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are known to potentially cause heart rhythm problems that may be exacerbated whether combined with other drugs with similar effects on the heart and induce adverse liver kidney and cerebral effects99 thus as discussed in this review treatments addressing the immunopathology of the infection such as immunomodulatory drugs approved for different clinical indications have become a major focus such approaches show the advantage to override viral mutational escape and to exert less-selective pressure on viral population although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggering such process hence future dissection of immune signaling pathways triggered by sars-cov-2 will provide novel insight on the effects of the virus on human immune system and may reveal relevant biological players that can be targeted to blunt cytokine storm notably since it is well established that innate immune responses trigger the activation of multiple and redundant signaling pathways an effective therapy may require to acting at the same time on multiple signaling pathways in this regard cocktails of immunomodulatory drugs such as monoclonal antibody targeting a specific cytokine eg tnf- inhibitors il-1-inhibitors il-6 inhibitors corticosteroids eg prednisone methylprednisolone and dexamethasone and s1pr1 agonists eg fingolimod rather than a single drug might be more effective in the management of covid-19 by exerting either synergic or additive effects in this regard it would be of key importance to assess whether patients with immune-mediated disorders treated with immunomodulatory drugs such as cytokine blockers are more resistant to the excessive immune response observed in covid-19 patients and more protected against sars-cov-2-driven pneumonia however to date no evidence reporting either decreased or increased risk of sars-cov-driven pneumonia has been documented in this patients and further investigations are required to verify this hypothesisfurthermore another aspect to better investigate concerns the possibility that the uncontrolled immune response to viral infection may cause detrimental systemic effects on several physiological systems such as the nervous endocrine renal and cardiovascular systems accordingly it is likely that the massive cytokine and chemokine release may critically impact on these physiological systems thereby inducing both short- and long-term detrimental effects as an example the neuro-invasive potential of sars-cov and mers-cov has been previously reported100 thus given the high similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it is likely that this latter displays a similar potential101103 as a matter of fact a study carried out in 214 covid-19 patients reported that about 88 of severe covid-19 cases showed neurologic manifestations such as acute cerebrovascular diseases and impaired consciousness104finally beside the putative long-term effects directly induced by sars-cov-2 infection another key issue to address concerns the long-term effects of empirical and experimental treatments in covid-19 patients in this regard a study carried out in 25 recovered sars patients recruited 12 years after the viral infection reported significant differences in the serum metabolomes in recovered sars patients compared with controls105 in particular a significant metabolic alteration  increased levels of phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol  has been found to coincide with the effect of methylprednisolone administration105 thus suggesting that high-dose pulses of steroid treatment may induce long-term systemic damage associated with serum metabolic alterations105therefore all the challenges discussed above highlight some of the major gaps in our knowledge of covid-19 clinical spectrum underlying immune signaling pathways systemic effects and long-term pathological signatures which need to be urgently fulfilled by future investigationscoronaviruses covs are rna viruses they may infect both humans and animals leading to lethal and contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 or coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 is characterized by high genetic homology with sars-cov and mers-cov 1 sharing with them 790 and 518 nucleotide identity respectively several studies have shown that sars-cov predominantly infects airway and alveolar epithelial cells vascular endothelial cells and macrophages sars-cov-2 and sars-cov use the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for infection indicating that the same cell types are targeted and infected 23in sars-cov-2 infection the early onset of a rapid viral replication may cause extensive apoptosis of epithelial and endothelial cells and vascular leakage this frequently leads to acute lung injury and lethal inflammatory responses 4 although antiviral drugs glucocorticoids and mechanical ventilation have been used there is no specific treatment for covid-19 at the moment 5 therefore in the absence of a standard therapeutic intervention the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent acute lung injury is needed pulmonary formulations of anti-inflammatory drugs could represent a good option in combination with systemic antiviral drugs or glucocorticoids in pulmonary administration the drugs are directly carried to the airway and alveolar epithelia in high concentration providing rapid onset of the therapeutic response with prompt relief of lung occlusion and respiratory distress symptoms nevertheless the drugs used by pulmonary administration in covid-19 should be characterized by low toxicity to avoid injury to the airway and alveolar epithelia already damaged by the viral infection fenretiniden-4-hydroxyphenyl retinamideis a semisynthetic derivative of all-trans-retinoic acid it is endowed with many pharmacological features including anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities prevention of obesity and type-2 diabetes 6 and the well-known antitumor activity on a wide range of tumors 78910111213141516 moreover its low toxicity profile has been proved in many clinical trials also in long term treatments 121718 therefore due to its poly-pharmacology fenretinide administration by pulmonary formulations may be expected to be protective against acute lung injury ali acute respiratory distress syndrome ards caused by sars-cov infection and could represent a useful tool in a multimodal therapy aimed at establishing a rapid anti-inflammatory and antiviral effectpulmonary hyper inflammation is a common feature in covid-19 patients when sars-cov is inhaled and infects epithelial cells in the lungs an immune response is activated by the local dendritic cells that phagocytose the virus and circulate to the regional lymph nodes where they present antigens to t cells activated t cells migrate to the lungs where they mount the immune response helper t cells secrete cytokines that regulate and assist the immune response cytotoxic cd8 t cells ctls recognize and kill the infected cells they release pro-inflammatory cytokines perforins and granzymes to induce programmed cell death 19 however the cytokines produced by ctls can damage uninfected as well as virus-infected cells and their massive production may cause detrimental effects leading to acute lung injury sars-cov-2 infection is characterized by a rapid viral replication that triggers an amplified immune response with the activation of a cytokine storm the consequent massive inflammation and increase in vascular permeability induce an abnormal accumulation of neutrophils macrophages inflammatory monocytes and lymphocytes in the lung alveoli further increasing cytokine production 20 in this condition the regulation of the immune response is lost and the cytokine storm is further activated without therapeutic intervention the development of aliards and permanent alterations in lung functions may result in dire consequences 4 figure 1 moreover the circulation of cytokines to other organs can lead to multi-organ damagefenretinide is the most investigated retinoid due to a significant antitumor activity on a wide range of tumor types 78910111213141516 combined with a favorable toxicological profile 121718 besides its antitumor activity multimodal interactions with several biological mechanisms endow fenretinide with other pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory activity antiviral activity and prevention of obesity and type-2 diabetes 6 the anti-inflammatory activity of fenretinide has been largely proved and its mechanism of action has been characterized in different pathological conditions in inflamed tissues where the macrophages are characterized by a significantly higher ratio of arachidonic acid aa vs docosahexaenoic acid dha than in normal tissues fenretinide induced normalization of the aadha ratio thus inhibiting phosphorylation of erk12 and decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines 21 moreover fenretinides ability to downregulate the production of aa and increase the levels of dha provided attenuation of inflammation in cystic fibrosis 22 osteoporosis 23 and in a model of spinal cord injury 24 in a mouse model of allergic asthma fenretinide inhibited lypopolysaccaride lps-induced expression of various th1 and th2 cytokines including ccl5 ccl7 ccl11 cxcl1 cxcl2 cxcl9 cxcl10 interleukin il-6 tnf- and inos 25 in lps-exposed mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells bend3 cells fenretinide showed inhibitory effects on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 mcp1 inos and tnf- fenretinide may inhibit nf-b signaling by reducing its nuclear translocation via downregulation of ikk and ib phosphorylation 26 this hampers the secretion of inflammatory modulators that is closely associated with the activation of nf-b signaling in mouse monocytemacrophage cells infected with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans fenretinide suppressed jak-stat pi3k-akt pkc and downstream nf-b signaling pathways therefore attenuating il-1 il-6 and pge2 proinflammatory cytokine expression 27 fenretinide has been demonstrated to induce reactive oxygen species ros generation and oxidative stress in tumor cells as a part of its cytotoxic mechanism 2829 in contrast it has not increased ros in normal cells such as fibroblasts peripheral blood mononuclear cells 29 and normal and activated peripheral lymphocytes 30 therefore its anti-inflammatory activity in non-tumor tissues is not counterbalanced by the ros-inducing activity and no detrimental effect can be expected when fenretinide is applied to non-tumor tissuesthe antiviral activity of fenretinide has been proved in different virus types in a screening study using a library of pharmacologically active compounds lopac of bioactive compounds against the respiratory syncytial virus rsv fenretinide was identified as a specific blocker 31 in the dengue virus denv fenretinide has shown high activity both in vitro and in vivo 32 its mechanism of action includes inhibition of denv non-structural protein 5 ns5 recognition by host nuclear import proteins importin-1 upregulation of transcripts representing the protein kinase r-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase perk arm of the unfolded protein response upr phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 eif2 with consequent translation attenuation and induction of an antiviral state 33 fenretinide inhibited the steady-state accumulation of viral genomic rna and reduced viremia when orally administered in a murine model of denv infection the molecular target responsible for this antiviral activity was distinct from other known inhibitors of denv and appeared to affect other members of the flaviviridae including the west nile modoc and hepatitis c viruses 34 fenretinide inhibited the zika virus zikv in mammalian cell culture and reduced both viremia and brain viral burden in a murine model this antiviral activity was correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of zikv rna it was found that fenretinide reduced rna synthesis without direct inhibition of the viral polymerase or chemical destabilization of membrane-associated replication complexes rather fenretinide acted via an indirect mechanism mediated by a host factor 35 in both zikv and denv fenretinide inhibited the non-structural protein 5 ns5 which contributed to pathogenesis by antagonism with the production of interferon-i ifn-i 36 as it is well-known ifn-i promotes an early protective host mechanism against viral infection by driving an antiviral state in non-immune cells and activating antiviral immune responses therefore the reestablishment of ifn-i production by fenretinide can block the early onset of viral infection 37 the delayed release of ifn-i is well known in sars-cov and mers-cov infections as mechanisms to hinder the bodys antiviral response 38 the viral mechanisms of ifn-i evasion are multifaceted including sequestering and shielding rna within double-membrane vesicles modification of viral mrna 5-cap structures and specific targeting of antiviral cellular pathways 3940 in sars-cov and mers-cov inf-i production is protective only at the early stages after infection at later time points on the contrary when exaggerating immune response takes place ifn-i and inflammatory cytokines become pathogenic 41no studies on the ability of fenretinide to block inf-i evasion in coronavirus have been reported so far but by analogy with flaviviridae some fenretinide activity on the mechanisms regulating the inf-i evasion in coronavirus might be expectedfenretinide treatment has been found to inhibit hiv infection by perturbing cell membrane structure and inhibiting crucial early events in the hiv fusion process 42 fenretinide indeed is known to modify the biosynthesis and metabolism of ceramides therefore changing localized membrane domain organization cell membrane modifications might alter the trafficking of virions through the endocytic pathway thus leading to non-productive infection 4243sars-cov-2 predominantly infects airway and alveolar epithelial cells vascular endothelial cells and macrophages by linking angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 that is abundantly expressed in the human lungs after linkage to ace2 the viral entry into the host cells is mainly mediated by endocytosis consequently inhibition of cell entry may be expected by treatment with fenretinideit has been observed that the endocytic pathway of sars-cov-2 also involves autophagy with the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes 44 autophagy represents an essential cellular process decreasing virus infections beclin1 becn1 is one of its key regulatorsmers-cov replication results in reduced becn 1 levels with a consequent block of the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes 45 thus autophagy-inducing becn1-increasing agents may have antiviral effects 46fenretinide has demonstrated autophagy-inducing ability in different cell types in human mammary carcinoma cell line mcf-7 fenretinide triggered an autophagic cell death pathway mediated by an increase in beclin 1 expression 47 in human pancreatic cancer cells fenretinide induced autophagy by ros increase 48 in gastric carcinoma hcg27 autophagy was stimulated by the accumulation of dihydroceramide induced by fenretinide 49 another target for antiviral activity is the akt1mtor pathway indeed a kinome analysis of mers-cov-infected cells has detected phosphorylation changes of several regulatory kinases including akt1 and mtor these changes have been correlated to autophagy 5051 the pharmacological use of akt1- and mtor-pathway inhibitors has shown promise for antiviral therapy against several viruses including mers-cov 51 the inhibitory effect of fenretinide in akt1 and mtor pathways has been reported in tumor cells 52 and in monocytesmacrophages 2753 all these findings clearly show the involvement of fenretinide in multiple pathways controlling viral replication therefore even in the absence of specific studies on sars-cov-2 an indirect antiviral activity of fenretinide may be supposed through the induction of an antiviral environment hindering supportive steps of viral replication both at a cellular level and in the infected tissuesfenretinide has been well-tolerated in many clinical trials aimed at evaluating its antitumor activity in pediatric and adult cancers oral administrations of fenretinide in corn oil gelatin capsules 4000 mgm2 for 28 days or in a lipid matrix lym-x-sorb 61 mgkg for 7 days have been well-tolerated at high doses and for protracted periods of time no significant hematological alterations or dose-limiting side effects have been obtained 954 in these studies many other clinical trials with fenretinide have confirmed its tolerability 175556 a phase ii study reported thrombocytopenia anemia hepatosplenomegaly in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes orally treated with fenretinide at 300 mgday for 4 weeks and escalated to 400 mgday for other 8 weeks 57 thrombocytopenia was also observed in a phase i study in some patients with hematologic malignancies after administration of fenretinide 905 mgm2 as a continuous intravenous infusion for five consecutive days 58 in a very recent study in mice oral fenretinide led to splenomegaly and increased the circulating leukocytes 59a trial aimed at evaluating the effect of fenretinide as a chemopreventive agent included 1435 patients that received a 5-year fenretinide oral treatment endpoints considered for safety assessment indicated that fenretinide was endowed with good tolerability indeed the most common adverse events were diminished dark adaptation 190 and dermatologic disorders 186 less common events were gastrointestinal symptoms 130 and disorders of the ocular surface 109 these symptoms occurred during fenretinide treatment and recovered over time 1260 in covid-19 patients the rapid evolution of the disease requires prompt treatment because only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention in this regard pulmonary drug delivery offers the advantage of carrying the bioactive molecule in direct contact with the pathological lung epithelia thus ensuring a rapid onset of the therapeutic response high local drug concentrations may be easily obtained by pulmonary administration with a concomitant increase of the pharmacological effect but without the side effects elicited by other administration routesdrugs administered by enteral or parenteral routes indeed need to reach the blood circulation to be distributed to tissues and organs and enter the pathological site this general distribution may provide extensive side effects particularly when high drug administration doses are required to achieve a therapeutically active concentration of the drug in the pathological sitethe increased pharmacological effect provided by high drug local concentrations and the decreased toxicity due to lack of a systemic distribution may improve the overall therapeutic efficiency of the drugs administered by pulmonary route as demonstrated in several respiratory diseases such as asthma cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 61the inhalation devices play a crucial role in the effectiveness of pulmonary drug administration the most common devices are nebulizers eg jet nebulizers ultrasonic nebulizers and vibrating mesh nebulizers metered-dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers 62 the selection of the inhalation device depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the drug and its formulation liquid formulations are administered by nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers and solid formulations by dry powder inhalers in each case the inhalation device provides aerosol particles whose size can control the extent of inhaled drug accumulation and the site of drug deposition within the airways smaller particles achieve a greater total drug accumulation in the lungs and farther distal airway penetration compared with larger particles particles smaller than 5 m in diameter may flow in the airstream beyond the retro-pharynx and reach the trachea particles of 25 m in diameter are deposited in the upper respiratory tract at the level of the trachea and tracheal bifurcation particles smaller than 2 m in diameter deposit in the lower airway and alveolar epithelia 6364 then the modulation of intrapulmonary deposition through the control of the aerosol particle size can appreciably improve the inhalation drug therapy figure 2 the pulmonary administration of drugs mainly provides a local therapy but may also provide a systemic therapy when the physicochemical characteristics of the drugs can support their absorption through the alveolar epithelium at extents suitable to elicit systemic effects indeed the large surface area extensive vascularization and single-cell barrier in the alveoli make the lungs an appropriate portal for the systemic absorption of molecules such as insulin human growth hormone etc 65pulmonary delivery of fenretinide could be a valuable tool in covid-19 due to the possibility of obtaining a very high drug concentration in the airway and alveolar epithelia thus triggering a rapid onset of local anti-inflammatory response at the same time the ability of fenretinide to induce an antiviral environment could further enhance its therapeutic efficacy figure 3 in order to be effective pulmonary fenretinide formulations should provide aerosol particle size smaller than 2 m for deposit in the lower airway and alveolar epithelia where the infection process is amplified by the extensive vascularization moreover after deposition they should trigger a rapid drug release to speed up the onset of the therapeutic activitysuch formulations require fenretinide solubilization in an aqueous phase and the adequate solubilization degree to provide high concentrations of the bioavailable drug in the lungs after inhalation unfortunately the hydrophobic character of fenretinide strongly hinders its aqueous solubilization moreover the possibility to use solubilizing agents such as tensides or water-mixable co-solvents is severely restricted by tolerability issues in the formulations destined to inflamed lungshighly tolerated aqueous fenretinide formulations have been obtained by complexation with cyclodextrins 52 or encapsulation in nanomicelles 66 complexation with 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin has increased fenretinide aqueous solubility from 0017 mgml pure drug to 241 mgml complex the aqueous formulation of the complexed drug administered by the parenteral route was well-tolerated and increased the drug bioavailability and antitumor activity in mouse models of different tumor types 52nanoencapsulation in phosphatidylcholine-glyceryltributyrate nanomicelles has increased fenretinides aqueous solubilization up to 388 mgml nanoencapsulated drug the intravenous administration of the nanomicelles in mice bearing tumor xenografts showed enhanced drug bioavailability and antitumor activity 66 moreover high tolerability was demonstrated by the absence of adverse effects after repeated administrations and for protracted periods of time therefore the in vivo tolerability and the ability to provide high fenretinide solubilization levels suggest that complexation with cyclodextrins 52 or encapsulation in nanomicelles 66 can be valuable means for preparation of safe and efficient pulmonary fenretinide formulationsantiviral drugs act on the coronavirus by direct mechanisms inhibiting key viral enzymes responsible for genome replication or hindering viral entry to human cells remdesivir is the most promising among the antiviral drugs it exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against rna viruses in previous studies it showed antiviral activities both in vitro and in vivo against different coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov 6768 in a recent study remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 in vivo 69ivermectin is an anti-parasitic agent which has proved to exert antiviral activities toward both hiv and dengue virus 70 recently an in vivo study put in evidence its capability to reduce viral rna up to 5000 fold in sars-cov-2 infection 71lopinavirritonavir are protease inhibitors they are used in combination in the treatment of patients with hiv infection several clinical preclinical and in vitro studies performed on sars-cov and mers-cov proved that the lopinavirritonavir combination was effective against these viruses 727374hydroxychloroquine is active against malaria as well as autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus it has been recently investigated as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug for its ability to increase the endosomal ph which prevents virus-cell fusion 75 hydroxychloroquine has been shown to specifically inhibit the replication of sars-cov by interfering with the glycosylation of its cellular receptor ace2 76 recent in vitro studies revealed its ability to effectively reduce the viral copy number of sars-cov-2 77immunomodulating drugs able to stimulate innate antiviral immune responses are now repurposed for the treatment of covid-19 natural killer nk cells represent a highly specialized lymphoid population of the innate immune system with potent activity against virus-infected cells migration of nk cells and macrophages to the lungs has been demonstrated to play a major role in the clearance of sars-cov 78 indeed the innate response itself can control sars-cov infection without the help of ctls and antibodies particularly in the early stages of the infection process type i interferons are secreted by virus-infected cells and represent a host protective mechanism recombinant interferons used alone or in combination with other drugs have provided a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against hcv respiratory syncytial virus sars-cov 79 and mers-cov 73 recent trials are assessing their safety and efficacy in covid-19 drugs interfering with the il-6 pathway are used to attenuate the inflammatory response in covid-19 80 elevated il-6 levels are predictive of poor prognosis in patients with ards 81 the pathway of il-6 signaling occurs through il-6 receptors which are expressed predominantly on neutrophils monocytes macrophages and some lymphocytes 82 tocilizumab and siltuximab are monoclonal antibodies against il-6 tzls-501 is an anti-il-6 receptor antibody and sarilumab an il-6 receptor antagonist they all are designed to inhibit the binding of interleukin-6 to its receptors thus alleviating cytokine release syndromethalidomide has been repurposed for the treatment of covid-19 due to its anti-angiogenic anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity its anti-inflammatory activity is mainly based on the inhibition of tnf- production thalidomide has shown promise in the treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases such as lupus erythematosus and crohn disease 83 preclinical studies proved that thalidomide was effective in treating mice infected with influenza virus h1n it decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells and inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines 84 recent studies are evaluating its efficacy in sars-cov-2 85lenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide it is currently used in the maintenance therapy of multiple myeloma due to its immunostimulatory effect on nk cell number and function combined with an acceptable toxicity profile lenalidomide has been proven to limit the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-12 il-1 il-6 and increased il-2 and ifn 8687 many studies have demonstrated the lenalidomides strong anti-angiogenic activity 88899091 with respect to thalidomide lenalidomide is expected to provide a superior activity and decreased side effects in covid-19 treatmentglucocorticoids have been used in sars-cov and mers-cov infections to restrain lung inflammation and immune responses 929394 their use has provided side effects such as secondary bacterial infections osteoporosis and prolonged viral clearance glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone are now under evaluation in covid-19 for effectiveness and safety 85pulmonary administration of fenretinide in combination with the drugs currently used in covid-19 treatment could represent a new effective tool to improve the efficacy of the single drugs and produce a strengthened overall pharmacological responsefenretinide is particularly suitable to be used in combination because its poly-pharmacology may reinforce the activity of several drugs and its high tolerability may enable large adjustments of the administered dose without toxicity concernsthe combination of fenretinide with the antiviral drugs used in covid-19 is expected to improve the treatment efficacy due to the ability of fenretinide to induce an antiviral environment that can behave as an adjuvant to the specific antiviral activity of the drugsin combination with the immunomodulating drugs fenretinide may contribute to enhance the innate immune response due to its stimulating effect on nk cells proliferation and cytotoxicity 9596 moreover its anti-inflammatory activity largely demonstrated in several models may boost the attenuation of the inflammatory response induced by the immunomodulating drugs in particular the ability of fenretinide to decrease il-6 2527 should improve the efficacy of the drugs blocking the il-6 pathway such as tocilizumab siltuximab sarilumab tzls-501the combinations of thalidomide or lenalidomide with fenretinide are expected to be very effective due to the multiplicity of mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of both types of drugs particularly the decrease of tnf- 2526 and the antiangiogenic effect 9798 provided by fenretinide added to the same effects provided by thalidomide and lenalidomide should boost the anti-inflammatory response elicited by the combination fenretinide and lenalidomide were evaluated by intravenous administration in a mouse model of neuroblastoma high tolerability and antitumor activity were obtained with this combination 66 in regard to the administration route the drugs to combine with the pulmonary fenretinide are expected to be administered by enteral or parenteral routes depending on the form of the formulations available on the market however the pulmonary administration route would be the best option because as already reported for fenretinide the local drug administration in the pathological site would provide a rapid onset of the therapeutic response moreover in addition to local therapy systemic therapy may also be obtained if the drug absorption through the alveolar epithelium can take place at a suitable extentthe utility of fenretinide anti-inflammatory activity associated with its high tolerability has been repeatedly demonstrated in lung-related pathologies such as cystic fibrosis allergic asthma and chronic lung infections its antiviral activity in the zika virus dengue virus respiratory syncytial virus hepatitis c virus and hiv has been largely proved and attributed to several mechanisms of action although there is no direct evidence of fenretinide application in covid-19 the multiple inhibition mechanisms demonstrated in the studied viruses and the involvement of fenretinide in multiple pathways controlling viral replication strongly suggest that fenretinide could provide an indirect antiviral activity towards sars-cov-2 as well as other virus types by means of the induction of an antiviral environment hindering infection therefore both the anti-inflammatory activity and the ability to induce an antiviral-environment indicate that fenretinide may have supportive adjuvant utility in treating covid-19 fenretinide administration by means of pulmonary formulations may further improve its therapeutic value by providing high drug concentrations in the pathological lung epithelia and a fast onset of the drug activity which is particularly important in sars-cov-2 infection where only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention moreover the pulmonary administration of fenretinide in combination with the drugs that are currently used in sars-cov-2 infection could represent a new effective tool in covid-19 treatment on the 31 december 2019 the world health organization who was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin detected in wuhan city hubei province china about one month later on 8 january 2020 the chinese authorities declared the identification of a new type of coronavirus informing the who a few days later that the outbreak was associated with exposure in a seafood market in wuhan city the infection spread firstly in china and then in the rest of the world and on the 11th of march the who declared that covid-19 was a pandemiccoronaviruses covs belong to the subfamily orthocoronavirinae in the family of coronaviridae in the order nidovirales and this subfamily includes -coronavirus -coronavirus -coronavirus and delta-coronavirus 1 coronaviruses primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals and in the last few decades have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well 2 in human infections with highly virulent respiratory virusessuch as avian influenza h5n1 h7n9 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and coronavirus disease-19 covid-19immunopathogenesis caused by the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play an essential role in disease progression and mortality 3 several recent studies have reported that covid-19 caused the destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma including interstitial inflammation and extensive consolidation similarly to the previously reported coronavirus infection 45 during coronavirus infection it was observed that the lungs increased in weight with a mild pleural effusion of clear serous fluid named pulmonary edema and extensive consolidation 67 in some areas there was interstitial thickening with mild-to-moderate fibrosis but a disproportionately sparse infiltrate of inflammatory cells mainly histiocytes including multinucleated forms and lymphocytes 8 a dilatation of the airspaces was observed as was focal honeycombing fibrosis an intra-alveolar organization of exudates was described and the formation of granulation tissues in the small airways and airspaces was reported these lesions were typically located in the sub-pleural region and the cellular component mainly consisted of histiocytes as reported in a previous paper 9 xu et al described in their case report the pathological findings of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome at the x-ray investigation they detected a rapid progression of bilateral pneumonia the biopsy samples were taken from the lung the histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates 6considering that the mortality rate of covid-19 about 57 10 and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 911 11 it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures intended to contain the viral infectiona recent study analyzed the data of 150 covid-19 patients with the aim of defining the clinical predictors of mortality the results obtained from this study suggest that covid-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated cytokine storm syndrome considering that the plasma levels of il-6 were higher in deceased patients compared to in discharged subjects 12considering that a detailed study has not been performed on the immunological response to covid-19 the only way to discuss this thematic is to refer to previous knowledge about sars-cov and mers-cov the first response is obtained through pattern recognition receptors prrs including c-type lectin-like receptors toll-like receptors tlr nod-like receptors nlr and rig-i-like receptors rlr moreover several inflammatory factors are expressed such as il-6 and tnf- moreover the synthesis of type i interferons ifns is activated and these exert their actions against virus diffusion accelerating macrophage phagocytosis 13 figure 1in the light of these considerations and the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting il-6 and tnf- inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for covid-19 this review aims to highlight how a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection andor to ameliorate the outcome during therapythe first laboratory report about covid-19 patients indicated several parameters that were found to be altered in blood samples for example d-dimer neutrophil count blood urea and creatinine levels were significantly higher in the same way several cytokines such as il-6 and tnf- were overexpressed indicating the immune status of the patients 14il-6 represents pro-inflammatory signaling produced by adipose tissue for this reason this endocrine cytokine could be important in regulating the host response during acute infection 15several papers have described the essential role of il-6 in generating a proper immune response during different kinds of viral infection in the pulmonary tract others link this cytokine to an exacerbation of viral disease these latter findings support the hypothesis that il-6 upregulation during viral infections may promote virus survival and the exacerbation of the clinical disease 1617 indeed il-6 has a pleiotropic function and it is produced in response to tissue damage and infection in particular at the pulmonary level innate and adaptative immune cell proliferation is strongly influenced by this cytokine after targeting its specific receptor il-6 starts a cascade of signaling events mainly associated with the jakstat3 activation pathway promoting the transcription of multiple downstream genes related to cellular signaling processes including cytokines receptors adaptor proteins and protein kinase 15 furthermore it has been reported that il-6 is an essential factor for the survival of mice with a viral infection this cytokine promotes the optimal regulation of the t-cell response inflammatory resolution tissue remodeling promoting lung repair cell migration and the phagocytic activities of macrophages as well as preventing virus-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells however experimental scientific evidence also suggests potential adverse consequences that increased levels of il-6 might have on the cellular immune response against viruses in this context different possible mechanisms involving this cytokine might affect viral clearance ultimately favoring the establishment of a persistent viral state in infected hosts 1819tumor necrosis factor is a cell-signaling protein cytokine involved in systemic inflammation released predominately from macrophages but it is also released from a variety of other immune cells it has been well described that during infection with the influenza virus the expression of tnf- in lung epithelial cells was higher exerting powerful anti-influenza virus activity 20 in an animal model it has been demonstrated that tnf- plays a pivotal role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis tnf- signals via two receptors tnf-ri and tnf-rii the first receptor tnf-ri promotes intracellular signaling involving c-jun n-terminal kinase jnk and nuclear factor nf-b while the other receptor tnf-rii promotes tnf-ridependent cell death without directly inducing apoptosis although both receptors are broadly expressed it is known that the majority of inflammatory signaling is elicited through tnf-ri 21 in an in vitro model it has been described that serinethreonine kinases can phosphorylate tnf-ri and its molecules preventing tyrosine phosphorylation 222324in patients with covid-19 the high serum levels of il-6 and tnf- are negatively correlated to t cells contrariwise it has been demonstrated that t cell levels were restored by reducing il-6 and tnf- concentrations 25 these findings suggested that these cytokines could represent important targets of anti-covid-19 therapiesthrough the secretion of adipokines adipose tissue participates in the regulation of several pathophysiological processes in many organs and tissues among the adipokines adiponectin is the most relevant adiponectin is one of the most abundant circulating adipocytokines accounting for 001 of total serum protein adiponectin is an important regulator of cytokine responses and this effect is isoform-specific it is involved in a wide variety of physiological processes including energy metabolism inflammation and vascular physiology these effects are mediated by two atypical widely expressed seven-transmembrane receptors adipor1 and adipor2 26 adiponectin has beneficial effects in cardiovascular systems and blood vessels protecting these tissues through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory and hypertrophic responses and stimulation of endothelial cell responses 27 adiponectin circulates as three different isoforms low molecular weightlmw medium molecular weightmmw and high molecular weighthmw 28infectious diseases are characterized by an increased production of adiponectin several papers suggest that adiponectin may be related to disease activity andor severity in different conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus since adiponectin has been found to display both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities controversial findings have been observed regarding the role of total adiponectin in systemic autoimmune and inflammatory joint diseases for this reason the relative contribution of each adiponectin isoform to the inflammatory response and joint andor tissue damage requires further study 29 it is reported that adiponectin is regulated by transcription factors in adipose tissue such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- ppar- 30 during viral infections it has been reported that the role of the predisposition of hosts is also important as well as their state of health and nutrition indeed it is well known that white adipose tissue is considered an endocrine source of biologically active substances with local andor systemic action called adipokines the inappropriate secretion of adipokines seems to participate in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases including endothelial dysfunction inflammation and atherosclerosis 313233the biological function of adipokines in lung diseases seems to be mainly related to the inflammatory process in particular the intercorrelation between adipose tissue and the lung has become evident as the involvement of adiponectin has been demonstrated in several lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd emphysema and cancer 34 in fact with specific regard to copd a low-grade inflammatory state has been demonstrated 353637 moreover increasing evidence suggests that adiponectin also exerts a crucial role in the vascular endothelium maintaining vascular homeostasis and protecting against vascular dysfunctions altogether these findings support the anti-inflammatory role of adiponectin in copd and in general in other lung diseases 38the critical role of adiponectin in the pathophysiological conditions of the lung is also supported by the modulation of adipors with the downregulation of adipor2 it has been described that the adiponectin oligomerization state is altered in copd moreover the presence of adipor1 and adipor2 with a lower expression of adipor2 compared to adipor1 in lung tissue 39 has been demonstrated the low expression of adipor2 could suggest a specific role of this receptor mainly implicated in adiponectins effects on inflammation and oxidative stress mainly it has been observed that higher levels of adiponectin are associated with a significant and specific increase in hmw adiponectin representing the most biologically active forms thus hmw adiponectin increases il-6 secretion in human monocytes and human monocytic leukemia cell lines but does not suppress lipopolysaccharide lps-induced il-6 secretion byn contrast lmw adiponectin reduces lps-mediated il-6 release and also stimulates il-10 secretion 40 furthermore several in vitro studies have demonstrated that adiponectin in the a549 adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cell line has an essential apoptotic effect and also reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- blocking nf-b nuclear translocation 4142indeed adiponectin can reduce innate and adaptive immune cell proliferation and polarization also blocking the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-2 and il-6 and enhancing that of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 with a decrease in the phosphorylation of ampk p38 erk12 and c-jnk 43444546 data from in vitro studies on lung cells were consistent with an anti-inflammatory function of adiponectin and adiponectin-deficient mouse models developed lung function impairments and systemic inflammation 47 the possible role of adiponectin in inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and in critical illnesses has been the subject of recent investigations particularly the hmw isoform has a specific role in pulmonary diseases and critical illnesses even if its role should be better clarified 4849an interesting study reported that systemic adiponectin concentrations in humans fall during the acute phase of lung infection particularly during the early phase the pro-inflammatory state is generated by the high systemic tnf- and il-6 concentrations with the subsequent inhibition of adiponectin production contrariwise it has been described that the reduction in tnf- and il-6 factors generates a corresponding bounce-back in systemic adiponectin concentrations 50 although it is still unclear whether the modulation of systemic adiponectin or its signaling pathways has any therapeutic benefit in pulmonary or critical illnesses it may serve as a novel therapeutic or preventative tool for these illnesses in the future one obvious pharmaceutical treatment would be the exogenous administration of adiponectin by the inhalational or intravenous route although this has been tried in mouse models 51 the problems to be overcome prior to human administration include establishing what the biologically active molecule is and what role post-translational modifications have upon its function and the associated difficulties in generating biologically active molecules on a large scaleconsidering the difficulty linked to the direct administration of adiponectin in the last few years other drugs have been used that indirectly improve adiponectin production for example a synthetic ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors can increase adiponectin mrna in adipocytes improving the production and secretion of adiponectin 52535455 moreover other drugs such as fibrates can increase systemic adiponectin levels by enhancing ppar- activity 5657 another way to improve adiponectin levels is the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 585960 furthermore it is possible to stimulate adipocyte differentiation 61 and the activation of ppar 62 finally it has been described that calcium channel blockers 63 and a central-acting anti-hypertensive agent 64 also increase systemic adiponectin concentrations 65the possibility to improve the action of adiponectin through diet is intriguing it has been described that nutritional interventions may help to regulate systemic adiponectin concentrations in an animal model it has been demonstrated that a diet with a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids and supplemented with -3 can improve the plasma levels of adiponectin increasing gene expression 66 on the other hand in humans adiponectin levels are positively associated with a healthy lifestyle and the mediterranean diet even if the mechanisms of action are not completely known 66 finally in light of these considerations in covid-19 therapy it could be very useful to combine drug therapy with a specific diet regimenanother important mediator involved in the immune response and influenced by nutrition are fatty acids in particular -3 pufas 6768 in fact during bacterial and viral infections they are able to act on immune cells and regulate diverse inflammatory processes -3 pufas are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and play an essential role in the resolution of inflammation 69in several lung infections the administration of pufa can ameliorate the outcome of the patient in acute pneumonia sharma et al reported in their study that the dietary supplementation of -3 pufa can exert an overall beneficial effect against acute pneumonia through the upregulation of the hosts specific and nonspecific immune defenses 70 -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa -3-fatty acids the key components of fish and flaxseed oils are increasingly consumed by the public because of their potential health benefits and can be used clinically for the treatment of metabolic cardiac inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 71 however numerous studies have shown that these compounds are immunoregulatory and immunosuppressive and thus may increase susceptibility to infection while reports suggest that -3 pufas may have beneficial effects against extracellular pathogens few studies have been performed on systemic viral infections in mammals jones and roper described in their study that a diet rich in -3 pufas did not significantly lower survival of the vaccinia virus infection at least with short-term 6 week feeding in mice 71-3 pufas are metabolized into various mediators possessing anti-inflammatory properties such as resolvins and protectins it is known that -3 pufas can reduce nf-b activation by preventing nuclear p65 nf-b translocation furthermore -3 pufas minimize the activation of erk12 mapk also reducing cox-2 production the -3 pufa-derived lipid mediator could markedly attenuate influenza virus replication via the rna export machinery in addition the treatment of protectin d1 with peramivir could completely stop mouse mortality 72-3 supplementation was previously studied in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards singer and shapiro suggested that the enteral administration of natural antioxidant substances could improve oxygenation and clinical outcomes in icu patients 73 a systematic review performed in 2015 reported a positive effect only for patients suffering from ards with high mortality 74 a more recent meta-analysis highlighted the importance of clinical trials in order to clarify the use of -3 fatty acids and antioxidants in patients with ards to ascertain the positive effects in order to reduce the lengths of icu stays and the numbers of days spent on ventilators 75although the role of -3 supplementation in ards should be better clarified its pivotal role in reducing reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 il-6 and il-8 76 is well knowntherefore -3 pufas including protectin d1 which is a novel antiviral drug could be considered for potential interventions for covid-19as previously described other dietary constituents can be used to improve the patients outcomes during lung infection regulating the inflammatory response among these antioxidants play an important role in protecting lung cells against viruses and bacteria viral infection leads to an increase in the intrapulmonary oxidative burden in many diseases the balance between oxidants and antioxidants redox balance is altered with severe consequences 77 the pathophysiological mechanisms by which free radicals generate various types of stresssuch as oxidative nitrative carbonyl inflammatory and endoplasmic reticulum stresslead to lung inflammation and an altered lung immune response in this scenario dietary antioxidants may play an important role against lung oxidative stress 77 several studies reported the protective role of the antioxidants in lung infection and in lung inflammation 7879in particular vitamin c polyphenols and flavonoids can play a protective role in lung infections being immune modulators and inflammatory mediators indeed as reported by carr et al during infection vitamin c levels may become depleted for this reason vitamin c supplementation can attenuate infection based on this evidence these authors suggested a clinical trial with vitamin c infusion for the treatment of severe covid-19 patients 80among polyphenols epigallo-catechin 3 gallate egcg is the most potent ingredient in green tea and exhibits antibacterial antiviral antioxidative anticancer and chemo-preventive activities recently numerous studies have investigated the protective effects of egcg against asthma and other lung diseases such as copd and lung pneumonia egcg may suppress inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs of asthmatic mice and may also inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition emt via the pi3kakt signaling pathway through upregulating the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog pten both in vivo and in vitro 81moreover flavonoids can be used to attenuate lung injury in mice it has been reported that they inhibit influenza virus and toll-like receptor signaling blocking nf-b translocation 82therefore as summarized in table 1 supplementation with vitamin c flavonoids and polyphenols can be tested in covid-19 patients both in order to prevent viral infection and to improve patients outcomesduring pulmonary infections and particularly in covid-19 patients intracellular signaling leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 which act in concert with chemoattractants such as cxcl1 and cxcl2 to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmns to the lungs killing pathogens but generating fibrosis 83another important consideration during covid-19 infection is related to the modification of the secretory products of the upper and lower airways which usually include mucin and pulmonary surfactant during infection mucin production is upregulated with the function of preventing microbes from binding to and infecting epithelial cells 84 the primary source of phospholipids pls in the lung is pulmonary surfactant synthesized and released by alveolar epithelial type ii cells the surfactant contains approximately 8090 pls with fatty acid chains that can be oxidized during different challenges in the lung 85 the oxidation of these pls in the lung can occur in the setting of an increased oxidative stress situation such as infection and inflammation 86 the immune effects of oxidized phospholipids oxpls during infectious diseases are inevitably dictated by the balance among activation degradation and scavenging it has been shown that oxpls are generated in the lung during several pulmonary infections including influenza and avian influenza h5n1 as well as sars coronavirus even if the mechanisms of action are not well known 878889 as reported by imai et al oxpl-induced inflammation is mediated by tlr4 and trif driving an increase in il-6 production 89 it is intriguing to consider that oxpl-dependent defects in phagocytosis and ros generation may lead to an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections 90 cholesterol is the major neutral lipid in pulmonary surfactant in which it is thought to promote the spreading mobility and adsorption of surfactant films 91 as previously documented modulating adiponectin levels can be considered an important way to reduce cytokines levels in this way the adverse effects related to the covid-19 infection should be attenuated it is well described in animal models that the consumption of hyperlipidemic diets rich in saturated fat reduces the levels of adiponectin while diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and supplemented with -3 pufa increase adiponectin levels reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines 66innate and adaptive immune responses are influenced not only by oxpls and cholesterol but also by the fatty acid profiles of tissues in response to pharmacological agents and diet 92 several studies performed in animal models demonstrated how -3 pufa uptake into the lung tissue influences outcomes associated with infection promoting the resolution of inflammation 93 in another study -3 pufas reduced the levels of pmns and lowered il-6 levels in lung infections 94 these positive effects remain controversial for example jones and roper reported that in their experimental model no statistically significant differences were found among the diet regimens with and without -3 pufas with respect to the susceptibility of mice to viral infection morbidity viral organ titers recovery time or mortality 71in conclusion it is well known that general treatments are very important to enhance the host immune response against rna viral infection in addition the immune response has often been shown to be weakened by inadequate nutrition in many model systems as well as in human studies however the nutritional status of the host until recently has not been considered as a contributing factor to the emergence of viral infectious diseases the recent reports about the pathogenesis of covid-19 suggested that one of the most important consequences of this infection is the cytokine storm syndrome 95 which could be strictly linked with coagulopathy generating acute pulmonary embolism caused by in-situ thrombosis 9697 therefore a great number of clinical trials are ongoing to define a useful therapy to attenuate cytokine storms 98for these reasons an adequate -3 pufa intake may be a valid strategy against viral infection indeed following the recommended intake of -3 pufa in the range of 05 and 2 of total calories 250 mgday may be important to protect against an excessive inflammatory response also reducing il-6 levels this theory found important support in a recent study that demonstrated that -3 pufa-derived lipid mediator protectins can suppress influenza virus replication through a mechanism that blocks the export of viral mrna moreover imai demonstrated that this mediator can be used in combination with the antiviral peramivir even at late time points in infection 99 nevertheless the efficacy of -3 pufas at the clinical level is under investigation for example hecker et al described a beneficial effect for a diet regimen with -3 pufas describing that the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels decreased after this diet regimen 100 the suggested positive role in the outcome and prevention of the covid-19 infection is summarized in figure 2in addition adiponectin plays a role in lung diseases and obesity in the development and progression of lung disease and cancer a pathogenic role of adiponectin was defined by both in vivo and in vitro studies recently immunometabolic pathomechanisms have been identified as important factors determining and modulating lung function and disease particularly adiponectin levels have been found to be greater in patients with copd compared with in control patients and adiponectin-deficient mice are protected from several lung diseases 101 moreover it has been reported that adherence to the mediterranean diet was associated with an increase in adiponectin levels improving cardiovascular system functionality 102 particularly in elderly people 103 these findings are only apparently contradictory to the first data about the mortality rate from covid-19 infections in the mediterranean area such as in italy and spain 104 first of all the data have been referred only to the tested population moreover it is well described that the presence of several comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular diseases severely influenced the mortality rate reported in this area 105 all these comorbidities can be counteracted with a correct dietary regimen therefore both adiponectin and -3 pufas appear to be attractive biomarkers for monitoring lung disease progressionfinally considering that the covid-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 and tnf- a modification of the dietary regimen in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of the patients improving their outcomesgiven the similar pathway of action it can be hypothesized that adiponectin and -3-pufa could be used as real drugs to reduce inflammation reducing both il-6 and tnf- levels as well as ameliorating the lung damage that occurs following coronavirus infectioncoronaviruses covs are rna viruses infecting both human and animals this infection involves the respiratory gastrointestinal and central nervous system 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are infectious and lethal and have caused thousands of deaths in the past two decades the recent outbreak was discovered in wuhan china this highly contagious disease has spread throughout china and other countries 2 although antiviral therapy corticosteroid therapy and mechanical respiratory support have been applied there is lack of a specific treatment for covid-19 2melatonin n-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine is a bioactive molecule with an array of health-promoting properties melatonin has been successfully used to treat sleep disorders delirium atherosclerosis respiratory disease and viral infections 3 previous research has documented the positive effects of melatonin in alleviating acute respiratory stress induced by virus bacteria radiation etc 4 5 6 herein we review the evidence indicating that melatonin will have supportive adjuvant utility in treating covid-19 induced pneumonia acute lung injury ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ardspatients with covid-19 who were infected by sars-cov-2 are reported to present with fever dry cough myalgia fatigue and diarrhea etc with symptoms varying somewhat with the patients age in some cases the severe progression of the disease results in aliards respiratory failure heart failure sepsis and sudden cardiac arrest within a few days 27 the pathogenic examination of lung specimens from mild covid-19 patients who were retrospectively found to have covid-19 at the time of lung cancer surgery showed edema proteinaceous exudate with globules patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and moderate formation of hyaline membranes 8 in a postmortem assessment of a covid-19 patient with severe ards specimens of infected lungs demonstrated bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with edema pneumocyte desquamation and hyaline membrane formation 9though these pathological reports were reported in only a small number of cases the findings do resemble the pathological features found in sars- and mers-induced pneumonia 10 sars-covs mers-covs and sars-cov-2 are classified in beta-coronavirus family members 11 recent published research suggests that sars-cov-2 shares 790 nucleotide identity to sars-cov and 518 identity to mers-cov 12 indicating a high genetic homology among sars-cov-2 mers-cov and sars-cov in sars-cov and mers-cov infected animal model marked inflammatory and immune responses may activate a cytokine storm and apoptosis of epithelial cells and endothelial cells subsequently vascular leakage abnormal t cell and macrophages responses ensue and induce aliards or even death 13based on genetic homology and pathologic features of the infected lung we predicted that a cytokine storm also prevails in patients with covid-19 in the blood of patients with covid-19 there was a marked increase in interleukin 1 il-1 interferon  ifn- interferon-inducible protein 10 ip-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 as well as il-4 and il-10 when compared to that of sars patients this suggests some potential difference from sars and mers in the pathogenesis of coronavirus 2 there is also a potential repressed immune function in covid-19 patients with the hypo-albuminemia lymphopenia neutropenia and decreased percentage of cd8 t cell 27 recent reports suggest that in some covid-19 patients although being negative for the viral nucleic acid test still sometimes present with a high level of inflammation a clinical trial using certolizumab pegol a tnf blocker along with other anti-virus therapies may have beneficial effects in covid-19 patients collectively the finding indicates that inflammation is a major feature in covid-19 patients thus we hypothesize that excessive inflammation depressed immune system and an activate cytokine storm substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of covid-19in the early stages of coronaviruses infection dendritic cells and epithelial cells are activated and express a cluster of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il-1 il-2 il-6 il-8 both ifn- tumor necrosis factor tnf cc motif chemokine 3 ccl3 ccl5 ccl2 and ip-10 etc these are under the control of immune system thus the overproduction of these cytokines and chemokines contributes to the development in disease 14 15 16il-10 produced by t-helper-2 th2 is antiviral with an infection of coronaviruses leading to a marked decrease in this agent 1718 interestingly covid-19 patients sometimes have a significantly elevated level of il-10 2 whether this is a feature of the covid-19 infection or the result of medical treatment is unknown the amplification of the inflammatory response would promote cellular apoptosis or necrosis of the affected cells which would further fuel inflammation followed by increasing permeability of blood vessels and the aberrant accumulation of inflammatory monocytes macrophages and neutrophils in the lung alveoli 19 this vicious circle would intensify the situation as the regulation of immune response is lost and cytokine storm is further activated resulting in dire consequencesthis putative cytokine storm pathology associated with coronaviruses is also supported by experimental sars-cov models one of which showed that the severity of ali was accompanied by an elevated expression of inflammation-related genes rather than increased viral titers in another case the ablation of ifn- receptor or the depletion of inflammatory monocytesmacrophages caused a marked rise in the survival rate of coronaviruses host without a change in viral load 1920 both situations suggest a potential amplifying mechanism involved in cov-induced aliards regardless of the viral load if a similar pathology also exists in covid-19 the attenuation of the cytokine storm by targeting several key steps in the process could bring about improved outcomesmelatonin is not viricidal but it has indirect anti-viral actions 3 due to its anti-inflammation anti-oxidation and immune enhancing features 21 22 23 24 there are situations in which melatonin suppresses the features of viral infections in mice whose central nervous system is infected by virus eg encephalitis the use of melatonin caused less viremia reduced paralysis and death and decreased virus load 25 in previous respiratory syncytial virus models melatonin caused down-regulation of acute lung oxidative injury pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inflammatory cell recruitment these findings along with those recently summarized by reiter et al 3 support a rationale for melatonin use in viral diseases also melatonins anti-inflammation anti-oxidation immune enhancing actions supports its potential attenuation of covid-19 infection fig 1
melatonin exerts anti-inflammatory effects through various pathways sirtuin-1 sirt1 may mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of melatonin by inhibiting high mobility group boxechromosomal protein 1 hmgb1 and thus down-regulating the polarization of macrophages towards the pro-inflammatory type 26 in sepsis-induced ali the proper regulation of sirt1 attenuates lung injury and inflammation in which the application of melatonin might be beneficial 27 nuclear factor kappa-b nf-b is closely associated with pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative responses while being an inflammatory mediator in ali the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin involves the suppression of nf-b activation in ards 2829 melatonin reportedly down-regulate nf-b activation in t cells and lung tissue 3031 the stimulation of nf-e2-related factor 2 nrf2 is crucial in protecting lung from injury in related studies melatonin induces the up-regulation of nrf2 with therapeutic effects in hepatoprotection cardioprotection etc 32 whether nrf2 is involved in the cov-induced ali remains unknown but the close interaction of sirt1 nf-b and nrf2 suggests their participation in the cov-induced aliards as such the data support the potential anti-inflammatory action of melatonin inflammation is commonly associated with an elevated production of cytokines and chemokines while melatonin causes a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf- il-1 il-6 and il-8 and an elevation in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 3334 there may be however some concerns about the potential pro-inflammatory actions of melatonin when used in very high doses or under suppressed immune conditions where it may induce an increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-2 il-6 il-12 tnf- and ifn- 35 conversely in ali infection models melatonin presents with anti-inflammatory and protective action 6the anti-oxidative effect of melatonin cooperates with its anti-inflammatory actions by up-regulating anti-oxidative enzymes eg superoxide dismutase down-regulating pro-oxidative enzymes eg nitric oxide synthase and it may also interact directly with free radicals functioning as free radical scavenger 34 viral infections and their replication constantly generate oxidized products in a sars-induced ali model the production of oxidized low density lipoprotein activates innate immune response by the overproduction of il-6 alveolar macrophages via toll-like receptor 4 tlr4nf-kb signaling thereby leading to ali 36 tlr4 is a receptor for the innate immune system and it is also a therapeutic target for melatonin in brain ischemia gastritis and periodontitis disease models melatonin has documented anti-inflammation actions via tlr4 signaling 37 38 39 the anti-oxidative effect of melatonin has also been confirmed in ali caused by radiation sepsis and ischemia-reperfusion 44041 in aliards patients especially when the disease is advanced and in patients treated in intense care units icus severe inflammation hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation with high oxygen concentrations inevitably increases oxidant generation locally and systematically 4243 accordingly we speculate that excessive oxidation also is likely involved in covid-19 the extensive studies of gitto et al 4445 who used melatonin to treat newborn infants with respiratory distress has documented the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of melatonin in the lung thus it is likely that the application of melatonin would be beneficial in controlling the inflammation and oxidation in coronavirus infected subjectswhen virus is inhaled and infects respiratory epithelial cells dendritic cells phagocytose the virus and present antigens to t cells effector t cell function by killing the infected epithelial cells and cytotoxic cd8 t cells produce and release pro-inflammatory cytokines which induce cell apoptosis 46 both the pathogen cov and cell apoptosis trigger and amplify the immune response the exacerbation of cytokine production excessive recruitment of immune cells and the uncontrollable epithelial damage generates a vicious circle for infection related aliards 47 the clinical characteristics of covid-19 suggest that a reduced level of neutrophils lymphocytes and cd8 t cells in peripheral blood 748 melatonin exerts regulatory actions on the immune system and directly enhances the immune response by improving proliferation and maturation of natural killing cells t and b lymphocytes granulocytes and monocytes in both bone marrow and other tissues 49 in macrophages antigen presentation is also augmented after the application of melatonin where the up-regulation of complement receptor 3 mhc class i and class ii and cd4 antigens were detected 50nod-like receptor 3 nlrp3 inflammasome is part of the innate immune response during lung infection the pathogen including a virus covs has not yet been tested triggers nlrp3 activation to amplify the inflammation there is probably a balance of the protective and damaging actions of nlrp3 in the lung thus in a mouse experiment inhibition of nlrp3 in the early phase of infection increased mortality whereas suppression of nlrp3 at the peak of infection allowed for a protective effect 51 this supports the use of melatonin in aliards when inflammation is most severe inflammasome nlrp3 is correlated to lung diseases caused by infection including influenza a virus syncytial virus and bacteria 51 52 53 the efficacy of melatonin in regulating nlrp3 has been proven in radiation-induced lung injury allergic airway inflammation and oxygen-induced ali and lps-induced ali models in which melatonin reduced the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the lung in ali due to the inhibition of nlrp3 inflammasome 4285455although there is obviously no report related to the use of melatonin in covid-19 patients in subjects with other diseases and an increased level of inflammation the application of melatonin showed promising results regarding the attenuation of circulating cytokines levels in a randomized controlled trial 8-week oral intake of 6 mgd melatonin caused a significant decrease in serum levels of il-6 tnf- and hs-c-reactive protein hs-crp in patients with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis 56 in another trial of patients suffering with severe multiple sclerosis orally 25 mgd of melatonin for 6 months also promoted a significant reduction in serum concentrations of tnf- il-6 il-1 and lipoperoxides 57 in the acute phase of inflammation including during surgical stress 58 brain reperfusion 59 and coronary artery reperfusion 60 melatonin intake of 10 mgd 6 mgd and 5 mgd of melatonin for less than 5 days induced a reduced level of pro-inflammatory cytokines a recent meta-analysis of a total of 22 randomized controlled trials suggested that a supplementary use of melatonin is associated with a significant reduction of tnf- and il-6 level 61 this clinical evidence suggests that the use of melatonin as a supplement may effectively reduce the levels of circulating cytokines and may potentially also lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in covid-19 patientsthe integrity of the vascular endothelial barrier is crucial in the immunoregulation within alveoli severe inflammation and immune responses induce epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis as well as increasing the production of vegf which aggravates edema and the extravasation of the immune cells from blood vessels experimental evidence suggests that melatonin mediates the suppression of vegf in vascular endothelial cells 62 based on clinical reports of covid-19 patients with severe aliards may also have an increased risk of sepsis and cardiac arrest 2 published reports indicate that the application of melatonin may ameliorate the septic shock via the nlrp3 pathway 63 specifically melatonin may a have preventive effect against sepsis-induced renal injury septic cardiomyopathy and liver injury 64 65 66 it was also reported that melatonin had benefits in patients with myocardial infarction cardiomyopathy hypertensive heart diseases and pulmonary hypertension and probably functions via the tlr4survivor activating factor enhancement pathway 67 moreover melatonin exerts neurological protection by reducing the cerebral inflammatory response cerebral edema and brain-blood barrier permeability under a number of experimental conditions 68 in the icu deep sedation is associated with increased long-term mortality and the application of melatonin reduces sedation use and the frequency of pain agitation anxiety 6970 also a recent meta-analysis showed that melatonin improves sleep quality in patients in the icu 71 thus the rationale for the use of melatonin in covid-19 patients not only focuses on the attenuation of the infection-induced respiratory disorders but also on an overall improvement and prevention of patients wellbeing and potential complicationswhen considering the use of melatonin to treat covid-19 the safety of the melatonin is of utmost significance to consider as reviewed previously short-term use of melatonin is safe even in those given high doses and the reported adverse effects are limited to occasional dizziness headache nausea and sleepiness in general melatonins safety in humans is very high 72 in clinical trials doses of 3 mg 6 mg and 10 mg of melatonin oral intake by patients in icu showed satisfactory safety when compared to placebo 707374 also even when melatonin was given to humans at dose of 1 gd for a month there were no adverse reports of the treatment 75 finally there were no adverse effects recorded after the use of melatonin in aliards animal studies 3428 while the safety of melatonin has been verified in many human studies its effect when given to covid-19 patients should be carefully monitored despite the very high safety profile of melatoninthe possible beneficial effects of melatonin as adjuvant use in covid-19 in anti-inflammation anti-oxidation immune response regulation has been repeatedly demonstrated in respiratory disorder models induced by infections and associated complications melatonin has a high safety profile although the direct evidence of melatonin application in covid-19 is unclear both its use in experimental animal models and in studies on humans has continuously documented its efficacy and safety and its use by covid-19 patients predictably would be highly beneficial

the inflammatory response is a natural defense mechanism of the body to remove harmful stimuli such as pathogens and initiate the recovery process sars-cov-2 the new coronavirus that induces covid-19 enters the body through the interaction between the s protein on the virus surface and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 molecules expressed in epithelial cells in the lungs 26 after sars-cov-2 replication in the respiratory and intestinal epithelium cells 27 it can induce an immune response that causes several alterations in the lung including inflammation and respiratory failure the binding of the covid-19 protein to ace-2 has been shown to downregulate its enzymatic activity and decrease angiotensin production 28 this mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and insufficiency caused by sars-cov-2 infection 29the inflammatory process is accompanied by the activation of the coagulation system which is characterized by the interaction of coagulation factors and as observed in severe cases of sepsis could lead to a disseminated intravascular coagulation process as recent studies described covid-19 is commonly complicated with coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation dic may exist in the majority of deaths in addition to pulmonary pneumonia and inflammation the presence of vascular dysfunction and thrombosis have been noted in severe covid-19 patients 30-32because ace-2 the receptor necessary for virus uptake is expressed in the cardiovascular system 33 it is expected that this tissue is also susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection some new studies showed that covid induces a vascular process in the lung which includes vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction 34 in this regard caruso et al 35 observed subsegmental vascular enlargement via computer tomography of patients with covid-19 the presence of thrombosis or acute pulmonary embolism in covid-19 patients associated with increased respiratory dead space was also reported by chen et al 36similar to the disease caused by sars-cov identified in 2002 pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature observed in covid-19 zhang et al 30 observed the presence of rp3 np sars-cov-2 protein in alveolar epithelium cells including those that were peeled and injured in the alveolar space in lung biopsies these authors also observed diffuse alveolar damage epithelial cells peeling with type ii reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes and fibrinous exudate associated with interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrateradiological findings in sars-cov-2-infected patients have been well-reported in several articles and the consensus is that covid-19 induces pneumonia with bilateral lung involvement and ground-glass opacity the latter being one of the most important radiological characteristic of covid-19 that can be present even in asymptomatic patients 3037-39according to mason 40 the pathogenesis of covid-19 can be divided into three stages the first asymptomatic phase occurs when the inhaled virus sars-cov-2 starts to replicate in the epithelial cells in the nasal cavity the second phase occurs when the virus migrates through the lung and a more vigorous innate immune response is triggered the last phase is manifested by hypoxia ground glass infiltrate and progression to respiratory failure a range of 20 to 30 of infected patients will progress to stage 3 of the disease and will develop pulmonary infiltrates that can also evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome ards ards is an acute inflammatory lung injury characterized by increased pulmonary vascular permeability enlarged lung weight and loss of aerated lung tissue 41 ards in its most severe form presents with intense pulmonary inflammation where there is severe hypoxemia 42 in terms of diagnosis ards is characterized by a pa02fi02 ratio equal to or less than 200 mmhg in essence the mechanisms underlying the triggering of ards are limited to damage to the alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium 4344 there is activation of neutrophils and high levels of proinflammatory cytokine release as well as activation of m1-like macrophages and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species the incidence of ards is higher in older patients 45 and aging of the lungs may contribute to the higher mortality rate due to sars-cov-2 in elderly and immunosuppressed individualsthe severe form of covd-19 is well-characterized by dyspnea hypoxemia and pulmonary tissue damage in addition 67-85 of critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu with covid-19 will develop ards and this will be the cause of death 4647 huang et al 46 reported that dyspnea and lymphopenia was present in more than 50 of infected patients and all of them showed abnormal findings on a chest ct scan considering the inflammatory responses lagunas-rangel et al 48 suggested that patients with severe covid-19 show a cytokine storm with acute increased levels of il-2 il-7 g-csf cxcl10 mcp-1 mip-1 tnf- and il-6 similar to patients diagnosed with sars and mers thus this suggests that mortality could be due to viral hyperinflammation that exacerbates lung damagesome evidence associated high il-6 levels with the severity and mortality of covid-19 4950 although the levels of interferon ifn- tend to be somewhat decreased in severe cases compared with moderate cases these cytokines are also increased in both the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage as well as in lung tissue from ards patients 51-53 this alteration in inflammatory response observed in covid-19 patients could be associated with a reduction in cd4 cd8 and nk lymphocytes 36 in this regard cd4 t and cd8 t were strongly reduced in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those in patients with mild disease 54steroid sex hormones may affect the strength of immune responses in opposite directions and result in a general difference between males and females with stronger immune responses in females than in males for review see roved et al 10 the dominant profile of the immune response may be dependent on hormonal variation during the female sexual cycle data indicate that female sex hormones enhance th2 immune responses and reduce th1 and this influence has been comprehensively covered in many reviews 95556 females seems to develop stronger cell-dependent and humoral responses to infection and vaccination the result of these differences can be observed when comparing the incidence of autoimmune diseases between sexes 57 which is higher in females and also by the observation of higher incidence of sepsis in males in parallel with higher plasma levels of th1 cytokines 58-60 also the incidence of sepsis in postmenopausal women increases to levels almost equal to those seen in age-matched men 61 in addition to hormonal influences there is an apparent genetic disparity since females carry two inherently polymorphic x chromosomes while males have only one polymorphic x chromosome passed from the mother the random process of x-chromosome inactivation provides females with a broader panel of proteins and enlarges the potential diversity of cell populations 9in women the cd4 t cell numbers are higher 62 and the ovarian cycle also influences the t reg cell populations with an increased number when estradiol levels are higher 63 these differences are connected to estradiol influence and affect immune responses to infection in addition estradiol exerts anti-inflammatory effects on innate immune responses by reducing monocyte and macrophage inflammatory cytokine release 64 delaying neutrophil apoptosis and enhancing neutrophil annexin-1 expression without increasing their activation 6566 experimental data confirm that the leukocyte function in females is more efficient than that in males detecting and eliminating pathogens more rapidly and that females have higher numbers of tissue macrophages with a greater density of toll-like receptors female macrophage phagocytosis is more efficient with nadph oxidase killing in parallel with an increased population of resident anti-inflammatory t-lymphocytes 67 the dendritic cell population is also influenced by female sex hormones with estradiol signaling via estrogen receptor  er- to increase the number of new dcs during inflammation 68 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells which are mostly involved in antiviral responses estrogen increases the release of type 1 cytokines that are important for an efficient type 1 immune response 69 the action of estradiol via er- also promotes activation of type 1 inf-inducible innate pathways and the ifn pathway genes are highly expressed in females regulating innate immunity 55considering lung inflammation mortality in ards is higher in males compared to females 7071 in the respiratory system sex steroids have been demonstrated to play important roles in the development and maturation of lungs and maintenance of normal lung function 72 and sexual dimorphism impacts the prevalence and incidence of several lung diseases 73 sex differences were identified in lung physiology and disease and have been studied in animal models sex also influences lung development and disease conditions 74 sex hormones may contribute to the disease pathophysiology or serve as protective factors depending on the disease involved women may be protected from certain age-related biological processes by producing lower levels of reactive oxidant species important drivers of pathology in age-related pulmonary disease 75 pulmonary diseases in women are influenced by age because of the variation of their level of estrogen increasing age is associated with higher levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and acute phase proteins the reduction of estrogen the increased fat tissue and the presence of subclinical infections contribute to the proinflammatory status of postmenopausal women the development and progression of age-related diseases is dependent on mechanisms associated with cellular senescence that may be triggered by telomere shortening which in women occurs at a slower rate than in men 76substantial evidence supports the anti-inflammatory role of systemic estrogens the mechanisms behind the female protection from infection are reported to be mediated mainly by sex hormones in particular 17-estradiol that can directly influence synthesis and signal transduction of multiple cytokines in vitro 67experimental investigations of several disease models confirm that higher levels of systemic estrogens promote anti-inflammatory responses 17--estradiol is the predominant estrogen during the reproductive years both in its total serum concentration and in overall estrogenic activity estradiol down-regulates immune functions in endothelial cells including the stimulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration to infected tissues 77-79 it is known that estrogen plays a protective role in endothelial function 80 activating the generation of nitric oxide no via endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos which is mediated by mechanisms that lead to an increase in no bioavailability through the induction of gene transcription and activation of enos via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinaseserine-threonine kinase pi3kakt 81 still studies by our group using an aortic occlusion model in male rats indicate that previous treatment with estradiol has a beneficial effect on the course of mesenteric ischemia and intestinal injury preventing mortality due to systemic inflammation 82 additionally in an intestinal ischemia and reperfusion ir model results indicate that female sex hormones notably estradiol exert a protective effect on preventingreducing lung and intestinal injuries caused by systemic inflammation after ischemic trauma 83-85 proestrus or estradiol-treated females showed reduced lung damage and inflammation in ischemia and reperfusion models 8687 and in a hemorrhagic shock model 88 in addition treatment with estradiol showed anti-inflammatory action similar to that of glucocorticoids with reduced expression of transcription factors involved in the inflammatory response and reduced recruitment of neutrophils by decreasing the production of interleukins such as il-8 in addition to chemokines and adhesion molecules 6689evidence from clinical and experimental studies strongly suggests that estrogens can modulate lung inflammation and allergic reactions because activation of estrogen receptors modulates immune cells and both innate and adaptive immune responses 5573 however the effects of estradiol as a pro or anti-inflammatory factor seem to be dependent on the pathogenesis of the diseases studied estradiol plays a critical role in improving outcomes in the settings of trauma shock sepsis myocardial ischemiareperfusion and acute lung injury ali experimental data with an intestinal ir model show that estradiol treatment in ovariectomized females reduces lung inflammation and exerts these effects by modulating enos protein expression in the lungs 83 as permeability edema represents a life-threatening complication of ali estradiol effects on the control of lung vascular permeability could be considered among the therapeutic strategies to reduce lung edema 83 in this model the inflammatory status of the lungs in ovariectomized females remains for a long period after the mesenteric reperfusion has been reestablished and is characterized by the release of proinflammatory mediators and danger signals the treatment with estradiol is able to downregulate the lung inflammation and its capacity for releasing cytokines 90 in males using the same ir model estradiol treatment was effective in reducing lung inflammation even at 1h after the reestablishment of intestinal perfusion 84 thus the effects of estradiol are important in the modulation of an already established lung inflammatory response it is noteworthy to point out that the proposed treatment was acute and could be considered a clinical alternativeestrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia 91 this is mediated by increased levels of prostacyclin and no as well as decreased levels of endothelin-1 et-1 it is well-established that estradiol exerts important vasoactive effects by activation of enos as well as modulation of vasoactive substances released from endothelial cells or the direct vasodilation effect via relaxation of smooth muscle cells 92 the vasoactive effects of et-1 can be influenced by estradiol and are organ-dependent 93 and estradiol and its metabolites inhibit et-1 synthesis 94 ovariectomized female rats present higher et-1 and estradiol replacement reduces et-1 peptide expression 95 thus estradiol acts as a protective vasoactive agent against deleterious microcirculatory conditions such as brain death and ischemiareperfusion injury 8296 brain-dead rats treated with 17-estradiol exhibit reduced lung injury mainly because of its actions on endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos 96 regarding injury estrogen can inhibit vascular responses and thus prevent proatherosclerotic events 97 the maintenance of organ homeostasis depends on a complex network of systems and reduction of blood flow may have profound consequences on organ status microcirculatory function following trauma can be affected by sex hormones 98 altering tissue perfusion and influencing inflammatory processes estrogen exerts a variety of rapid actions initiated after coupling with membrane receptors which may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flowalthough one of the consequences of severe covid-19 is the development of ards some studies indicated that respiratory phenotypes induced by covid-19 are slightly different from those classical phenotypes observed in ards patients 99 covid-19 patients developed a severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease which is silent most of the time 100 most recently small fibrinous thrombi in small pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in autopsies in cases of fatal covid-19 101 this could indicate the activation of the coagulation cascade in these patients in addition they also reported diffuse alveolar damage with intense epithelial viral cytopathic effects both in the alveolar and small airways more interestingly the presence of thrombus occurred in both damaged and preserved lung parenchyma areas all together these features suggested that anticoagulant drugs could have beneficial effects in covid-19 patientsestrogen reduces platelet aggregation the opposite effect of testosterone 102103 notelovitz et al 104 studied the short-term effects of estrogens on the coagulation-fibrinolysis process in surgically treated women and the results did not show abnormal or thrombogenic changes in coagulation parameters in vitro 17-estradiol is able to inhibit platelet aggregation by promoting ca2 extrusion or reuptake activity and its action is dependent on the increase of no synthesis 105 platelet reactivity plays a pivotal role in thrombus formation and in vitro data suggest that although women have a higher magnitude of platelet reactivity their response to aspirin is similar or even larger compared to that of men 106 experimental data show that a chronic high physiologic level of estrogen equivalent to that observed in pregnant mice had a significant inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation 107 estrogen mediates beneficial effects on the cerebral microcirculation and moderated cerebral thrombotic mechanisms by enhancing the plasma levels of no 108 moreover estrogens exert positive effects on the pulmonary vasculature by increasing prostacyclin release and no production by enos 109 cowman et al 110 evidenced a connection between age and decreases in platelet tracks platelet translocation and unstable platelet interactions the altered platelet function associated with aging was more profound in females compared with that of males and could be a result of a reduction in estrogen levels in womenconsidering virus-induced lung inflammation the excessive inflammation leads to tissue damage in this regard t cells seems to be reduced in covid-19 patients and the present t cells seemed to be functionally exhausted 111 severe covid-19 can induce ards in more than 50 of patients and neutrophils are considered to be the central cells involved in the pathogenesis of ards infected female mice that were administered estradiol showed pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils and virus-specific cd8 t cells releasing more inf- and tnf- 112 moreover exogenous estrogen treatment in female mice infected with h1n1 reduced total pulmonary inflammation and the levels of pro-inflammatory genes in the lung 113many viruses are affected by estrogen at the molecular level specifically in the replication machinery and maturation of the virion but to date no evidence has been presented for sars-cov-2 despite the well-known role of estrogen in inflammation to combat pathogens and infections it has been shown that estrogen receptors participate in repressing transcription virus genes one example is the hepatitis b virus hbv infection where er- interferes with virus gene expression through hnf-4 hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 binding to hbv enhancer i in hepatocytes 114 in the hepatitis c virus hcv infection model in vitro huh7 cells 17-estradiol reduced virus infection by interfering with assembly andor virus release disrupting the virus life cycle and this effect was inhibited by anti-estrogen fulvestrant 115 moreover hcv-infected women after postmenopause exhibit a reduced response to antiviral therapy and greater incidence of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic carcinoma 116117nevertheless the most likely antiviral effects of estrogen are mediated by inflammation modulation regarding the cells that participate in the immune response dendritic cells play a crucial role escribese et al 118 infected dendritic cells with newcastle disease virus ndv and treated the cells with 17-estradiol the authors observed a diminished type i ifn synthesis also reducing the cd4 t cell response suggesting that estrogen has an antiviral activity on rna virusesaccording to the evidence that female sex hormones exert antiviral activity in many organs the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators serms has been extensively explored in experimental systems to reduce virus infections reviewed by montoya  krysan 119 in general serms have been used for several therapeutic purposes such as in the treatment for infertility and osteoporosis but are mainly related to cancer as adjuvants in chemotherapy such as tamoxifen in viral infection this compound was suggested to be considered as an antiviral therapy because of its properties of disrupting viral replication during hiv human immunodeficiency virus infection in monocytes and cd4 t-lymphocyte cell lines 120 tamoxifen has also displayed a capacity to inhibit hcv replication via estrogen receptor assembly to rna-dependent rna polymerase ns5b 121122 murakami et al 122 showed that various serms reduce the production of hcv rna preferentially related to the extracellular but also intracellular virus proteins suggesting that serms may be a multi-targeted drug that interferes with several processes comprising virus entry and replicationof note the most approximate model of sars-cov-2 viral infection is found in mers-cov and sars-cov both have been demonstrated to be affected by toremifene citrate a classical serm which delayed virus infection due to the inhibition of the late endosome virus trafficking 123 and a similar effect was observed previously with ebola virus infection 124 in addition both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that toremifene and clomifene present antiviral activity against a large variety of ebola virus strains 125126 importantly it was also demonstrated that serms can elevate the survival rate of infected animals by 90 and 50 when using clomifene and toremifene respectively mechanistically it has been proposed that toremifen could target envelope proteins gp1 and gp2 which permit the viral attachment and access to host cells decreasing its stability and resulting in reduced endolysosomal membrane fusion 127 this may be considered good evidence to support that estrogen and estrogen-related compounds play a major role in antiviral therapies for sars-cov-2abundant literature highlights sex differences in immune response and its influence on the incidence and severity of diseases considering trauma shock and infection the female sex is associated with advantageous outcomes since the hormonal context exerts an important influence on the homeostasis control and the defense mechanisms it is important to consider the beneficial effects of estrogens with regard to providing better control of defense and the different immune cells involved in addition to cardiovascular system protection and flow maintenance direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated and the results point to a possible positive effect of estradiol as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 figure 1 studies are being carried out in order to analyze the effects estradiol on sars-cov-2 in vitro and in parallel there is already a clinical trial in courseall of the authors conceived the study and were responsible for the manuscript drafting editing and reviewon 11 march 2020 the world health organization who declared the coronavirus pandemic the sars-cov-2 virus covid-19 is a threat to the populations health air pollution is also one of the greatest challenges of our millennium and some early studies have highlighted a positive correlation between air pollution and the spread of the virus therefore it is crucial to define which role the atmospheric particulate plays in the spread morbidity and mortality of the virusin this context two hypotheses should be highlighted first covid-19 similarly to other viruses could also have an airborne transmission and particulate matter pm could act as a carrier through the aerosol conveying the virus and increasing its spread secondly pm could instead have induced damage to the lung cells increasing the inflammation state 1 this rise of inflammation may increase the mortality rate and the severity of expression of the disease in the most polluted areas the virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor to enter the cell ace2 generates an anti-inflammatory peptide and is overexpressed to play its role in the case of inflammation from pm exposure thus increasing the probability of covid-19 entering the cells 2 these hypotheses which are not mutually exclusive are an important starting point for future analyses aimed at explaining the positive correlation between the spread of covid-19 and air pollutionpathogens can reach the organism through various transmission mechanisms ingestion via the fecal-oral route inhalation inoculation contact iatrogenic transmission and coupling the most common route of transmission is the expulsion of pathogens through the respiratory system by infected subjects and the penetration into the receptive host by inhalation the saliva droplets from the infected subject are usually large and because of their weight travel short distances before falling to the ground in this case the transmission is defined as transmission by close contact this transmission is different from what occurs in the aerosol which is a suspension of solid or liquid particles within a gas phase the diameter of these particles is normally between 0001 and 100 micrometers thus they are very small particles that sediment slowly and are easily conveyed by air currents in this case the transmission is called long distance transmission as small viral particles are suspended in the aerosol they can be transported by particles such as in the case of the avian flu virus that was found in large concentrations in the air after the dust storms that occurred in asia even at a long distance from the outbreaks of origin 3the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 emerged in late 2019 in the city of wuhan in china and is now causing a global pandemic owing to its rapid spread it is thus necessary to understand how the transmission takes place to limit its further diffusion covid-19 as the sars-cov-1 virus is mainly transmitted by inhalation of droplets and with a smaller percentage by fecaloral route direct contact and through pregnancy airborne transmission by aerosols in long distances has been proposed only as a possibility to be verified by zhou wang 45 assisted by a committee of experts who have addressed the epidemic of coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 in the city of wuhan covid-19 belongs to the coronavirus cov family a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause mild to severe diseases from the common cold to respiratory syndromes such as mers middle east respiratory syndrome and sars severe acute respiratory syndrome the name coronavirus derives from the proteins that outline a crown shape and that are present on the surface of the virus in 2003 sars caused a minor but equally significant epidemic after which numerous studies were conducted about the route of transmission of the virusthe spread of the virus was analyzed in closed environments such as in aircraft cabins it was observed that sars has three prevalent transmission routes it spreads 21 by aerosol long distance 29 by close contact between individuals droplets and 50 by contact with surfaces fomite route 6a recent analysis proposed in the new england journal of medicine by van doremalen and collaborators 7 investigates the stability of the new virus in aerosol and on surfaces by comparing it with sars-cov-1 the surfaces analyzed are plastic stainless steel copper and cardboard covid-19 persists more on plastic and steel while copper and cardboard are more inhospitable to the virus from the results obtained it is observed that covid-19 remains in the aerosol for 3 h slowly reducing the infectious capacity such as sars-cov-1 the half-life of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 is similar in aerosol with an average of about 1112 h indicating that the epidemiological differences between the two are probably owing to other factors the virus persists on surfaces for days and in aerosol for hours 7many studies highlight the association between airborne infections and ventilation systems in buildings as in the case of other viruses such as measles avian and sars sars spread in 17 major cities in 2003 in a city environment people normally spend about 90 of their time indoors a low ventilation rate particularly in hospitals increases the probability of virus contraction in a building the air circulates from one environment to another with turbulent flow that favors the establishment of microenvironments in which pathogens proliferate viruses are transported by the aerosol at a certain distance that depends on the design of the buildings in which they circulate in this regard a multidisciplinary study is needed to analyze this effect and determine the correct ventilation rate to be applied in closed environments to decrease the probability of spreading these viral pathogens 8 this phenomenon has been analyzed in a hong kong hospital during the 2003 epidemic in this analysis it is observed that the droplets are moist but begin to evaporate after release by decreasing their size and may become small enough to circulate in the air in the hong kong hospital the distribution of air was analyzed and it was shown that an unbalanced air diffuser distribution led to the spread of the sars-cov-1 virus in the 8 a department where a greater incidence of the number of infections occurred 9a similar study was conducted in amoy garderns a group of residential buildings in hong kong that recorded an outbreak of sars in 2003 the investigators analyzed the ventilation system and the air transmission of the virus focusing on the residence buildings with the most elevated number of infections this analysis further confirms the need for reviewing the internal air quality and ventilation designs in buildings offices homes hotels and hospitals 10the transmission modes of sars-cov-1 and covid-19 are very similar as covid-19 also persists in the air and thus it can be assumed that it is also transported at greater distances than those observed in close contact infection despite the similarities between the new and previous viruses why has the new coronavirus displayed a higher spread rate in some areasthe air is composed of 78 nitrogen 21 oxygen and 1 other gases man is introducing into the air new components that can be harmful to the environment and human health air pollution is the result of the presence of gas and contaminating particles in the atmosphere the gases include carbon monoxide co nitrogen oxides nox ozone o3 sulfur dioxides so2 ammonia nh3 and volatile organic compounds vocs as well as some gaseous forms of metals particulate matter pm instead includes a mixture of compounds that can be grouped into five major categories sulphates nitrates elemental carbon organic carbon and crustal materials such as earth and ashpm as defined by the environmental protection agency epa is a term that indicates the set of particles dispersed in the air for enough time to be diffused and transported there are many sources of these particles pm is classified as pm10 and pm25 based on a diameter of less than 10 micrometers or 25 micrometers respectively 11pm are inhalable corpuscles that cause various damage to human health owing to their small size their toxicity is then increased as they can adsorb other substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and heavy metals hydrocarbons derive from oil and are higher in concentration during winter 12 pahs are hydrocarbons made up of two or more joined aromatic rings metals on the other hand are natural constituents of the earths crust metals that are toxic and tend to accumulate are mercury chromium cadmium arsenic lead and uranium 13 air pollution is a global public health emergency that affects people of all ages in every part of the world nowadays addressing ambient air pollution is the priority of the government and the who issues air quality guidelines to defend the population in general and the most vulnerable in particular 14 numerous epidemiological studies have shown the effects of air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular systems short-term exposure to air pollution at higher levels reduces life expectancy by aggravating pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases 15 cardiovascular effects induced by pm are linked to particles deposition in the lungs to their translocation through the air-blood barrier to extra-pulmonary sites and to the resulting systemic inflammation 1617 particles deposition rates are strictly linked to the particle sizesmaller particles have the highest deposition efficiency numerous studies also highlight correlations between the effect of pm and male infertility 18 as well as neurodegenerative diseases 192021in lombardy north of italy diesel combustion and solid biomass burning are responsible for 15 and 50 of the primary fine particles production respectively 22 diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of solid condensed or liquid and gaseous corpuscular fractions 23 the solid fraction is represented by diesel exhaust particles deps with a bio-persistent core of about 1030 nm in diameter 24 these primary particles composed of elemental carbon can then agglomerate into larger soot aggregates with mean diameters of 60100 nm 23 the dep surface can adsorb more than 300 chemical compounds which include pahs aliphatic hydrocarbons quinones transition metals and others 25 moreover biomass burning bb-derived particles are obtained as a result of inefficient combustion that generates a multitude of partially oxidized organic chemicals many of which have been associated with adverse health impacts 22 however dep has been shown to be even more toxic than bb 26these particles are included in pm25 fraction are less than 01 micrometers in size and thus can be classified as ultrafine particles ufps ufps can show worse and different toxicity profiles in comparison with those of larger particles with the same composition as their specific interaction with lung cells and their capability to translocate across the alveolar epithelial barrier 27 nonetheless it cannot be excluded that systemic toxicity may be mediated also by pm or ufps associated water-soluble components andor biochemical mediators released in the lung and then translocated in blood circulationwho has also indicated air pollution as responsible for a great risk for environment and health even more harmful to health is indoor air pollution in large urban areas it is thus essential to have correct ventilation systems in closed environments as the particulate matter in the aerosol can also host pathogens such as viruses and bacteria which can thus be easily transmittedair is a vehicle through which microbial agents can move around the environment plants and cellular fragments bacteria fungi viruses parasites and spores can be components of the bioaerosol 5 atmospheric pm would function as a carrier or as a transport vector for many viruses thus pm may have increased the effectiveness of the virus spread in the aerosol as it creates a microenvironment suitable for its persistence 28 pm10 and pm25 can be inhaled and in addition to the polluting particles the associated microorganisms are inhaled too recent studies also indicate that microbial community composition and concentration are significantly affected by particle concentration and dimension 29 the particles could also act as carriers which have complex adsorption and toxicity effects on bacteria 30 certain particle components are also available as nutrition for bacteria and the toxic effect dominates in heavy pollution the analysis of franzetti et al 31 of microbial community in pm10 and pm25 sampled in winter and summer in milan italy showed large seasonal variations in the microbial communities with plant associated bacteria dominating in summer and spore forming bacteria in winter the results obtained also indicate not only that the pm source can influence the presence of specific bacterial groups but also that environmental factors and stresses can shape the bacterial communityin addition inhalation transports the particles deep into the lungs especially those smaller than 25 microns pm25 and ufps and this allows the virus to develop within the respiratory tract and to cause infectionsin 2007 ciencewicki and jaspers 32 reviewed different epidemiological and experimental studies examining the association between and the effect of air pollutants and viral respiratory infections though potential mechanisms mediating these effects are largely unexploredin beijing china the composition of organisms in the air pollutants during a period with a high smog level was tested in a metagenomics analysis sequences of several pathogens including viral particles 01 in both pm10 and pm25 were identified the quantity of these pathogens for the respiratory tract increases with the increase in the concentration of pollutants 33the avian influenza virus h5n1 could be transported across long distances by fine dust during asian storms 3 and the correlation between pm concentration and the virus spread has been observed in the case of the spread of measles in china pm25 concentrations in 21 chinese cities and the number of measles cases per day per city were studied the analysis showed a positive correlation between those two factors the 10 gm3 increase in pm25 per day is associated with a significant rise in the disease incidence 34 a similar analysis of the childrens respiratory syncytial virus rsv spread in china in 2015 shows the same correlation rsv is a virus that causes damage to the lungs and bronchitis a positive correlation between the virus and pm concentration was observed in fact pollution increases the risk of rsv infection 35a 2018 analysis carried out in the po valley associates hospitalizations and the number of new rsv cases with pm10 concentration the data for the analysis were collected by arpa regional environmental protection agency in the region the results of this analysis showed that in the designated period the highest number of hospitalizations occurred in milan the city that had reached the maximum concentration of pm10 this study also shows a correlation between short- and medium-term pm10 exposures in particular in the two weeks preceding hospital admission and increased risk of hospitalization owing to rsv bronchiolitis among infants 36 there are several mechanisms by which pm induces an increase in infected cases a mechanism can be that the virus is bound to particles and transported if favored by climatic conditions 34concerning the effect of pm pollution and the spread of viruses in the population several recent studies have analyzed whether the different areas of the world with a high and rapid increase in covid-19s contagion were correlated to a greater level of air pollution at present there are three world areas where there has been a high number of people infected by covid-19 china where the pandemic started italy and the usa and the link between these countries is the very high level of air pollutants this is the reason that recent studies have focused on these areas to find a possible correlation in air pollution and covid-19s contagionthe investigation of this possible correlation should be analyzed at two levels a the high level of air pollution over the last years which has made the population more sensitive to covid-19 long-term exposition or b the sensitivity to the virus which is linked to the high level of air pollution in the period when the virus appeared short-term exposition it is known that chronic exposure to atmospheric pm contributes to increased hospitalizations and mortality primarily affecting cardiovascular and respiratory systems causing various diseases and pathologies including cancer 37 premature deaths due to acute respiratory diseases from such pollutants are estimated to be over two million per year worldwide 3839to evaluate the long-term exposition hypothesis pansini and fornacca 40 investigated the geographical expansion of the infection and correlated it with the annual indexes of air quality observed from the sentinel-5 satellite orbiting around china italy and the usa using annual means and analyzed different pollutant pm10 pm25 sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide and ozone the authors found positive significant correlations between covid-19 infections and air quality variables in each country and concluded that higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality namely with high pm25 carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide valuesregarding italy fattorini and regoli 41 and conticini and collaborators 42 came to the same conclusions it is known that the distribution of atmospheric pollutants pm25 pm10 nitrogen dioxide and ozone in italian regions during the last four years exceeds regulatory limits in northern italy particularly affected by covid-19 contagions the population has been constantly exposed to a chronic high level of air pollution the conclusive data of these papers indicate that long-term air-quality significantly correlated with the cases of covid-19 in up to 71 italian provinces providing further evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution may represent a favorable context for the spread of the virusfinally pansini and fornacca 43 associating several annual satellite and ground indexes of air quality in china iran italy spain france germany united kindom and usa with the covid-19 infection found statistically significant positive correlations between the high level of air pollution and covid-19 infections in italy the correspondence between poor air quality and covid-19 appearance and its induced mortality was the starkest yetrecently wu et al 44 fitting zero-inflated negative binomial mixed models corrected for confounders estimated for the united states a relationship between long-term exposure to pm25 and mortality rates to covid-19 they found statistically significant evidence according to this analysis a 1 ugm3 increase in long-term exposure to pm25 is associated with a 15 increase in covid-19 mortality rate the results of this article suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to the occurrence of more severe covid-19 results these findings are in line with the known relationship between pm25 exposure and many of the cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities that significantly increase the risk of death in covid-19 patients 44 concerning the effect of the short-term pm exposition and the spread of viruses in the population the position paper proposed by the italian society of environmental medicine sima considers pm as an important carrier that has contributed to the spread of covid-19 28 the high rapid spread of the covid-19 virus in the po valley which is also the foremost place of polluted air in europe could be related to the high concentrations of pm present in lombardy before the covid-19 pandemic 45for example bergamo one of the italian cities with the highest number of infected presents concentrations higher than the permitted annual average of pm10 and pm25 during the months of january and february 2020 the limits are 40 gm3 for pm10 and 25 gm3 for pm25 during these two months a central unit of the city via meucci station has detected an average daily concentration of 4428 gm3 for pm10 and 3831 gm3 for pm25 both values above the maximum limit set the number of days in which daily concentration values beyond the allowed threshold was observed for pm10 and pm25 to be 33 and 44 respectively figure 1in brescia during the same period an average of 5149 gm3 for pm10 and 4068 gm3 for pm25 was observed by the control unit located in villaggio sereno all values above the threshold there are 42 days for pm10 and 46 days for pm25 in which the daily concentration exceeds the average annual concentration allowed figure 2the same observation can occur in milan with the control unit in the citt studi area which showed an average concentration of 5559 gm3 for pm10 and 4218 gm3 for pm25 over the two months moreover in milan 45 and 49 days were observed for pm10 and pm25 respectively with daily concentration values above the annual average allowed figure 3from the analysis of the data collected by arpa wwwarpalombardiaitpagesariaqualita-ariaaspx in the italian region during the months of january and february concentrations of pm10 and pm25 were measured above the limits established by the countrys regulatory parameters in these same provinces there is a high and rapid increase in covid-19s contagion figure 4this evidence was confirmed by different studies frontera et al 47 analyzing air quality in italy and china in the period of maximum covid-19 virulence found that pm25 and nitrogen dioxide levels were particularly high and marteletti and marteletti 48 arrived at the same conclusions according to recent sima analysis these authors speculate that the atmosphere rich of air pollutants together with certain climatic conditions may promote a longer permanence of the viral particles in the air as a carrier thus favoring an indirect diffusionsetti et al 49 showed that a high frequency of pm10 concentration peaks exceeding 50 gm3 results in a spread acceleration of covid-19 suggesting a boost effect for the viral infectivity they also found significance differences both in pm10 exceedances and covid-19 spreading between northern and southern italian regions and placed a focus on milan and romezhu et al 50 analyzed the relationship between concentrations of six daily measured air pollutants pm10 pm25 sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide and ozone and confirmed covid-19 cases in 120 cities in china between 23 january 2020 and 9 february 2020 short-term exposition the authors examined the effects of the six air pollutants using six separate models to reduce collinearity as some of these pollutants were highly correlated they found significant positive associations of pm25 pm10 carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide and ozone with covid-19 confirmed cases while sulfur dioxide was negatively associated the authors conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between short-term exposure to higher air pollution and an increased risk of covid-19 infectionthe hypothesis that the atmosphere rich of air pollutants together with certain climatic conditions may promote a longer permanence of the of viral particles in the air thus favoring an indirect diffusion in addition to the direct one individual to individual has been postulated in a recent letter to the editor of journal of infection 47 considering a period of latency owing to the incubation of about 14 days a positive correlation can be observed between the pm concentration data and the number of infections figure 4 the high concentrations of pm during january and february could have increased the virus spread rate and speed in late februaryearly march in lombardy more than in other italian regionslastly another point to consider is the climatic conditions that could also have played an important role in increasing the contagion in fact the main atmospheric circulation pattern during february 2020 was characterized by an anomalous anticyclonic system over the western mediterranean basin centered between spain and italy and lower pressures over northern europe this climatic condition which produces dry conditions over southwestern europe may have provided optimal meteorological conditions for the virus propagation both indoors and outdoors in addition to the direct and indirect contact and short-range droplets 51 thus pm may have played a carrier role for covid-19 however this remains one of the hypotheses as the positive correlation between pollution in lombardy and in other countries and the outbreak of the epidemic could also be the result of other reasons in fact it is known from both in vitro and in vivo data and from epidemiological studies that lasting exposure to airborne pollutants induces a state of chronic lung inflammation 12325253545556numerous epidemiological studies have noted an association between pollution levels and hospitalizations for many reasons including respiratory diseases an increase in the mortality rate of several viral diseases has also been observed so in addition to analyzing the pm role in transmission it is important to understand how exposure to pollutants can increase the susceptibility and severity of these diseases as already discussed pm has small dimensions and for this reason it can be inhaled the repeated inhalation of these particles causes damage to lungs health long-term exposure to particulate matter can induce systemic damage 32 exposure to pollution has also been linked to the high mortality of the sars-cov-1 virus cui et al 57 using the air pollution index api showed that in the regions where this index was high there was double the chance of death than the areas with a low api index similarly in areas with a moderate api index there was an 84 probability of increased risk of death from sars the authors conclude that lasting exposure to pm would increase the virus mortality rateafter having demonstrated the positive correlation between viral infections in the respiratory tract and exposure to pm it is necessary to analyze the mechanism by which exposure to these agents can impact the subjects susceptibility and immune response to infection as respiratory tract cells are the first target of pm as well as the first target of respiratory viruses pathogens will invade already compromised cells if subjects are exposed to pm for a long time two mechanisms have been demonstrated to be induced in lungs after pm exposure both in humans and experimental models 58
oxidative stress exposure to these pollutants induces the production of free radicals that induce damage the cellsinflammation pm induces the activation of the immune response and thus the cell enters in an inflammatory statebegalli et al 53 analyzed the effect of different deps on lung and vascular cells in vitro the analysis highlights the increase in ros reactive oxygen species a marker of oxidative stress figure 5dep is rich in many metal oxides toxic to humans an analysis on lung cells a549 has shown a significant increase in il8 an interleukin used as an indicator of the pro-inflammatory response following exposure to pollutants figure 6 52 in fact it has been observed that there are numerous mechanisms acting at the level of inflammation for example another mechanism to consider is the ability of pollutants to have effects on immunity by modulating the antiviral response of exposed subjects a fundamental role of the inflammatory response is given by macrophages cells that can incorporate foreign particles including microorganisms into their cytoplasm and destroy them figure 7 56 however some studies have shown that exposure to pollution can reduce the phagocytosis ability of macrophages which thus will not be able to properly inactivate the viruses 54summing up the exposure to polluting agents alters the immune response of the lung cells and induces an increase in oxidative and inflammatory stress this cellular condition facilitates the attack of viruses and increases the severity of viral infections in exposed subjects for example pneumonia often of viral origin increases as a result of episodes of high pm10 pollution a 1999 study already investigated how pm10 alters respiratory tract inflammatory responses to the syncytial virus rsv a frequent cause of viral pneumonia in infants and the elderly it has been observed that at high levels of pm10 the response to the virus is reduced because the immune response to both the virus and pm10 simultaneously detected is less effective than the single immune response focused on defense against the rsv 59the po valley in northern italy where milan is located represents one of the most polluted areas of the country for both the high number of industries present and for its particular geographical conformation as it is enclosed between the alps and the apennines during 2010 in milan torre sarca pm10 and pm25 samples were collected and administered to mice for the purpose of analyzing the damage due to exposure to these particulates in the lung the microbiological analysis revealed the presence of pathogens adsorbed to the particles 31 and in alveolar cells and in the lungs pm activated strong inflammatory responses in fact high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor tnf-alpha and il6 have been found 12 it should be noted that il6 is responsible for the inflammatory storm that occurs in the most serious cases of patients with covid-19pm10 performs a toxic action on the lung parenchyma the analysis of the content of balf a fluid resulting from mouse bronchoalveolar lavage has shown an increase in cytotoxicity markers pm also contains metals with a very high cytotoxic effect on cells prolonged or persistent exposure to pm is supposed to exert heavy adverse effects on cell homeostasis mediated by a direct particles cell interaction within the district that pm reaches lung myocardial or even neuronal tissues or by the induction of a chronic inflammation resulting in a general systemic inflammation and sustained oxidative stress status 59a systemic spreading of lung inflammation in pm10sum-treated mice has been related to the increased blood total cell count and neutrophils percentage as well as to increased blood myeloperoxidase mpo the bloodendothelium interface activation has been confirmed by significant increases of plasma endothelin 1 et-1 and sp-selectin furthermore pm10sum induced heart endothelial activation and pah metabolism proved by increased et-1 and cytochrome p450 1b1 cyp1b1 levels moreover pm10sum causes an increase in brain heme oxigenase 1 ho-1 and et-1 these results state the translocation of inflammation mediators ultrafine particles lipopolysaccharide lps and metals associated to pm10sum from lungs to bloodstream thus triggering a systemic reaction mainly involving the heart and brain these results provided additional insight into the toxicity of pm10sum and could facilitate shedding light on mechanisms underlying the development of urban air pollution related diseases 5556another analysis showed that exposure to pm25 also determines a variation in the expression of some genes the effect of pm acts systemically on the human body sancini et al 60 found that et-1 heat shock protein 70 hsp70 cyp1a1 cyp1b1 and hsp70 ho-1 and mpo each increased within lung and heart of pm25win-treated mice the pm25win exposure had a strong impact on global gene expression of heart tissue 181 upregulated and 178 down-regulated genes but a lesser impact on lung tissue 14 up-regulated genes and 43 downregulated genes therefore prolonged exposure to high quantities of pm is a significant threat to people especially the elderly who may be apparently healthy but with compromises in the lung and cardiovascular tissue 60recently farina et al 26 demonstrated in vivo the activation of inflammatory response cox-2 and mpo in both respiratory and cardiovascular systems after exposure to ufps dep or bb biomass exposure to dep also results in increases in pro- and anti-oxidant ho-1 inos cyp1b1 hsp70 protein levels although stress persists only in cardiac tissue under repeated instillations statistical correlations suggest that stress marker variation was probably the result of soluble components andor mediators translocation from the first deposition site this mechanism appears more important after repeated instillations as inflammation and oxidative stress endure only in the heart in summary the chemical composition of ufps influenced the activation of different responses mediated by their components or pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative molecules indicating dep as the most damaging pollutant in the comparison 26 studies have shown that patients with systemic diseases have an increased risk of developing severe forms of covid-19 infection 61 therefore it cannot be excluded that the virus would be facilitated in the action on cells already in deficit this cells deficit would lead to more complex prognoses when there are damages to the lung and heart also owing to exposure to polluting agentscoronaviruses can generate mild or very serious pathological responses when these viruses attack the lower part of the respiratory tract they cause serious respiratory damage which can be fatal inflammation is an indispensable component of the response of our immune system however already for sars-cov-1 it was observed that in patients with a worse course of the disease there is a cytokine storm an excessive and dysregulated response 62the new covid-19 virus can also lead to several pathological effects from milder ones like colds and fever to more severe ones like pneumonia that can get worse in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards a type of respiratory failure responsible for the accumulation of fluid in the lungs and excessive reduction of oxygen in the blood ten percent of covid-19 cases can come to this pathological condition in which mechanical ventilation is involved and in some cases lead to death the course of the disease is more complex for the elderly and for patients with other concurrent pathologies 63in the blood of the patients with severe symptoms of covid-19 very large quantities of il6 are detected a marker of the inflammatory state an inflammatory storm is observed the immune response of the infected cells is to release cytokines that signal inflammation but an excess of these pro-inflammatory signals can be harmful to the cells of the pulmonary epithelium 64 the italian medicines agency aifa has authorized the first clinical trials to use drugs already available for treatment in covid-19 one approach is to lower the inflammation generated by a too strong immune response in fact among these trials many concern anti-inflammatory drugs aimed at quenching the inflammatory storm for example tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the il6 receptor by deactivating it therefore blocking the il6 transduction pathway the inflammatory state could be decreased 65 there are some predispositions to the inflammatory storm owing to the presence of other pathologies patients with a particular pathogenesis start from higher inflammatory cytokine levels and the advanced age unbalances the body towards a pro-inflammatory state another option is that may there are some genetic predispositions to these hypotheses we could add a predisposition due to pm exposure we observed that one of the pm mechanisms of action on cells is to trigger an inflammatory state with the production of interleukins such as il8 or il6 we could thus assume a predisposition by the subjects most exposed to pm over time to a manifestation of this storm of cytokines following the covid-19 infection and thus a more complicated course of the pathology this hypothesis could explain the positive correlation between covid-19 the pm concentration and the high mortality rate in some polluted areas such as in lombardythe analysis of conticini et al 42 of march 2020 proposes the correlation between air pollution and covid-19 lethality which varies in the different regions in italy in lombardy and emilia romagna on 21 march 2020 it was 12 while in the rest of italy it was 45 exposure to polluting agents makes the inhabitants of these areas more prone to developing severe respiratory conditions and it would be a predisposition to add as a co-factor 42covid-19 is characterized by the presence of spike proteins on its crown which allow it to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor present on the cells the virus enters the cells by endocytosis infecting them ace2 is a membrane enzyme found in the lungs arteries heart kidney and intestines cells and it regulates blood pressure by catalyzing the cut of the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin 2 into angiotensin 17 which is instead a vasodilator and anti-inflammatory molecule 66 it is hypothesized that because increasing age leads to an increase in blood pressure as a compensatory response our body expresses a greater number of ace2 on cell membranes to respond to this effect however this increase in expression also heightens the targets that allow access to the covid-19 virus some hypertensive drugs increase the expression of ace2 so this correlation should be verifiedace2 also has another task as the angiotensin 17 peptide also has an anti-inflammatory function it has been observed that the activation of ace2 can reduce the severity of lung damage from hyperoxia by inhibiting the inflammatory response and oxidative stress ace2 can in fact inhibit the intracellular signal of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nfkb pathway that activates the inflammatory response and activate that of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nrf2 pathway that activates the anti-inflammatory response as a protective mechanism against ros 67 thus an increase in ace2 increases the probability of attack by covid-19 but on the other hand the virus by binding to ace2 blocks its activity which instead seems to be very important for the immune defense and protection against inflammation that we have seen to be the major cause of deaths from covid-19 a lasting exposure to pm25 triggers oxidative stress and inflammation and the two pathways activated are those mentioned above nrf2 to respond to oxidative stress and nfkb which instead stimulates the inflammatory state 68in 2018 lin and coauthors 2 saw that exposure to pm25 induces acute lung injury ali in mice leading to an increase in inflammation with an increase in cytokine levels the effects of pm25 were observed in both wild type wt and in ace2 knockout mice it was observed that while in wt mice there was an improvement in lung damage after a few days in mice lacking ace2 the improvement was less evident this confirms the fundamental role of ace2 in the defense of our cells from the pro-inflammatory action of pm25 however the important point is that in wt mice the exposure to pm25 induces a significant increase in ace2 2in conclusion ace2 is important because a it activates the nrf2 anti-inflammatory pathway and instead turns off nfkb inflammatory to avoid a dysregulated inflammation response b covid-19 by binding to ace2 alters this mechanism and c ace2 is over-expressed following exposure to pm25 and thus it may be plausible that it could increase the probability of covid-19 infection with ace2 being the entry key for the virusrecently asselta et al 69 have analyzed the possible genetic explanation for the male predisposition to covid-19 infections the analysis focuses on two genes tmprss2 and ace2 the first seems to be an excellent candidate because of the presence of a certain allelic variant in the italian male population ace2 on the other hand was not related to the sex-predisposition but a single nucleotide polymorphism snp rs2285666 was detected in the italian and east asian population this snp had already been analyzed as a potential risk factor for hypertension type 2 diabetes and coronary artery problems and thus could be a genetic variant indicating a comorbidity for the virus according to the study ace2 would play an important role but it remains to be assessed whether the increase in the level of lung gene expression is related to an increase in the susceptibility and severity of covid-19 this increase in the level of expression of this variant could be owing to exposure by pm 69these analyses on the pm and covid-19 correlation are the foundations to start wider research the correlation between these factors is positive but it is important to understand the mechanism that explains it all mentioned studies indicate that both long-term exposure and short-term exposure to high levels of pollutants are correlated to an increase in covid-19 contagion worldwidethus it may be interesting to perform a systematic study placing pm collection units at strategic points all over the world for example hospital departments with a low ventilation rate and to analyze the microorganisms present in the search for covid-19 viral rna by metagenomics preliminary data obtained by setti and collaborators 70 would support this hypothesis as sars-cov-2 rna can be present on 34 outdoor samples collected in industrial site of bergamo province in a three-week period from 21 february to 13 march 13 on the other hand the populations also considering gender age and genetic factors that live in areas at high levels of pollutants are in a chronic inflammatory state which makes them more susceptible to respiratory and cardiovascular diseaseslastly covid-19 infection should be investigated in relation to ace2 expression after pm exposure in order to verify the different susceptibility to infection by pm exposed and non-exposed cellsa severe respiratory disease emerged in china in december 2019 and spread globally infecting more than 4 million people worldwide and causing the death of 287000 persons according to the whos situation report on may 13 2020 this new infectious disease was designated coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and a virus from the coronavirus family was found to be the causal agent of this pathology who coronavirus pandemic the virus was initially named 2019 new coronavirus 2019-ncov but later renamed by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 coronaviridae study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 2020 since the whos first situation report of sars-cov-2 infection on january 21 2020 public health systems and scientists have rapidly learned about the transmission and mortality rates the clinical manifestations as well as the immune responses although a more complete and precise understanding of the aspects of the covid-19 pathology could take several more monthssars-cov-2 is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of 30 kb which shares some sequence homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 79 homology and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 50 homology the spike protein also known as s protein of coronaviruses are involved in the viral entry into target cells the binding of the s protein to a specific cellular receptor allow the viral attachment to the surface of target cells while the s protein priming by cellular proteases facilitates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes figure 1 bioinformatic analysis of the viral genome as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 acts as the cell receptor for sars-cov-2 bao et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020a kim et al 2020 wang q et al 2020 while the serine protease tmprss2 is involved in the s protein priming hoffmann et al 2020b in normal human lungs ace2 is expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial type ii cells or type ii pneumocytes which are the cells responsible of producing the surfactant that reduces surface tension and prevents the collapse of alveoli dobbs 1989 therefore the destruction of type ii pneumocytes by sars-cov-2 infection affects this critical function of respiratory cells impairing the gas exchange function of the lung zhu et al 2020 there is also evidence of replication of sars-cov-2 in the upper respiratory tract since the inoculation of this virus to surface layers of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects and cessation of the cilium beating of the cells zhu et al 2020 on the other hand it was reported that sars-co-v directly infects macrophages and t cells a key feature in sars-cov-mediated pathogenesis perlman and dandekar 2005 shieh et al 2005 while a recent report suggested that sars-cov-2 can directly infect t cells through s protein-mediated membrane fusion wang x et al 2020 whether the virus is capable of infecting other immune cells is still unknown studies reported that the ace2 is also expressed in several extrapulmonary tissues including heart kidneys blood vessels and intestine crackower et al 2002 ding et al 2004 danilczyk and penninger 2006 this fact could explain at least partially the multiorgan dysfunction observed in patients with severe covid-19 guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 of note another receptor cd147 has been implicated in mediating host cell invasion by sars-cov-2 wang k et al 2020 however the role of cd147 and sars-cov-2 interaction in the pathology of covid-19 needs further researchsars-cov-2 binds to its receptor and enters the cells through endocytosis figure 1 then viral rna is released into the cytosol and the virus exploits the cell machinery to replicate finally sars-cov-2 is excreted from the cell by exocytosis the rapid viral replication cause massive epithelial cell apoptosis vascular leakage and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells jamilloux et al 2020 the control of the viral replication and the efficient regulation of the inflammatory response determine the outcome of this infectious disease figure 1 jamilloux et al 2020 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020 the majority of the persons infected with sars-cov-2 80 exhibit mild to moderate symptoms while approximately 15 progress to severe pneumonia and 5 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock andor multiple organ failure chan et al 2020 ding et al 2020 huang et al 2020 prompetchara et al 2020 wu et al 2020a high-quality clinical study performed by a group of clinicians and scientists from the university of hong kong in the city of shenzhen provided several important clinical features of covid-19 chan et al 2020 which were later confirmed by several clinical trials around the world bai et al 2020 ding et al 2020 huang et al 2020 prompetchara et al 2020 wu et al 2020 this pioneering study and the subsequent clinical investigations found a series of characteristics of covid-19 that can be summarized as follows a a high transmissibility of sars-cov-2 within the family context providing concrete evidence for human-to-human transmission b variable clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe ards and multiple organ failure c more severe clinical abnormalities seen in older patients andor patients with other co-morbidities diabetes hypertension cardiovascular diseases d the presence of sars-cov-2 rna in samples of asymptomatic persons highlighting the possibility for transmission of the virus from asymptomatic carriers and e the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in some persons suggesting the possibility for gastrointestinal involvement in sars-cov-2 infection and fecal-oral transmissionthe most common symptoms of covid-19 include respiratory symptoms such as cough sore throat shortness of breath and pneumonia as well as fever fatigue and in very few cases diarrhea and vomiting chan et al 2020 prompetchara et al 2020 secondary infections have been also reported to be involved in severe and fatal cases of sars-cov-2 infection huang et al 2020 around 10 of the fatal cases of covid-19 have identified co-infections of sars-cov-2 with influenza virus ifv ding et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and respiratory bacterial pathogens wang j et al 2020 importantly the role of the immune responses in the sars-cov-2 infection-induced lung and systemic damage has been highlighted by recent studies cao 2020 jamilloux et al 2020 tay et al 2020 the information regarding the immune responses to sars-cov-2 was the result of limited investigations and mainly from extrapolations using insights learned from the outbreaks of sars-cov and mers-cov both innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated by sars-cov-2 however uncontrolled inflammatory responses and impaired adaptive immunity are characteristics of covid-19 cao 2020 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020 the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung lymphopenia exhausted lymphocytes and a cytokine storm actively participate in tissue damage both locally and systemicallythe availability of therapeutic tools that could be used massively to prevent or mitigate the detrimental effects of emerging respiratory viruses such as sars-cov-2 on human health is therefore mandatory in this regard research from the last decade has reported the impact of the intestinal microbiota on the respiratory immunity it has been conclusively demonstrated how variations in the intestinal microbiota can affect the responses of respiratory epithelial cells and antigen presenting cells against respiratory virus attack influencing innate immune responses and the subsequent adaptive immunity moreover the selection of specific microbial strains with the ability to modulate immunity in distal mucosal sites made possible the generation of nutritional interventions to strengthen respiratory antiviral defenses villena et al 2019 in this article the most important characteristics of the available information regarding the immune response against sars-cov-2 virus are revised briefly in addition this review summarizes the knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the improvement of respiratory antiviral defenses by beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 the ability of orally administered beneficial microorganisms to differentially modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses in the respiratory tract and systemically clearly indicate the potential of immunobiotics to favorably influence the immune response against sars-cov-2 virusthe first barrier involved in the protection of the respiratory mucosa form viral attacks is the respiratory epithelium through its capacity to produce a mucus layer that is in constant displacement because of the action the ciliary movement the viral particles that reach the mucus layer in the conducting airways can be trapped and swept into the throat and eventually removed through the gastrointestinal tract when respiratory viruses successfully overcome this first barrier they interact with respiratory epithelial cells from the conducting airways andor the deep lung starting their attachment and internalization to initiate their replication hammad and lambrecht 2011 those respiratory epithelial cells as well as antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells dcs from the airways and the lung parenchyma and alveolar macrophages are the first to encounter viruses that enter the respiratory tract during the viral replication several pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps are exposed which are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors prrs expressed in respiratory epithelial cells dcs and alveolar macrophages neyt and lambrecht 2013 garbi and lambrecht 2017 the pamps-pprs interaction leads to the activation of several signaling pathways that induce the production of type i and ii interferon ifns and inflammatory cytokines ifns such as ifn- produced by virus-infected cells are able to act on neighboring immune and non-immune cells promoting an antiviral state through the up-regulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes isgs that counteract viral replication on the other hand inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 il-6 il-8 mcp-1 and il-17 among others induce the recruitment and activation of immune cells nk cells neutrophils and macrophages to promote the elimination of virus-infected cells hammad and lambrecht 2011 neyt and lambrecht 2013 garbi and lambrecht 2017 these defense mechanisms of the innate antiviral immunity are important because they are in several cases sufficient to induce the complete elimination of the respiratory virus or instead to support the generation of efficient cellular and humoral adaptive immune responsesthe proper and timely production of type i ifns in the respiratory tract in response to virus infection is crucial to suppress viral replication and dissemination at an early stage it was shown that coronaviruses are particularly adapted to evade immune detection and dampen this initial antiviral response mediated by type i ifns lessler et al 2009 kindler et al 2016 channappanavar and perlman 2017 an active suppression of ifns-mediated antiviral response was described for both sars-cov and mers-cov these two coronaviruses use multiple strategies to obstruct the type i ifn production and the signaling downstream of the ifnar sars-cov and mers-cov are able to modify the ubiquitination and the degradation of the adaptor molecules mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins mavs tnf receptor-associated factor 3 traf3 and traf6 impairing type i ifn induction kindler et al 2016 in addition both coronaviruses are capable of inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 3 irf3 nuclear translocation kindler et al 2016 the strength of the interference with the signaling leading to type i ifn production was associated with the disease severity channappanavar and perlman 2017 this mouse model of sars-cov infection demonstrated that the deregulated type i ifn production was the main cause of lethal pneumonia and that inflammatory phagocytes actively participated in the inflammatory damage the delayed type i ifn production in response to sars-cov or mers-cov infection compromises the early viral control leading to influx of hyperinflammatory neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages which contribute to lung immunopathology through the production of inflammatory factors channappanavar and perlman 2017 the same work demonstrated that exogenous type i ifns have both beneficial and detrimental effects depending on the time of administration early administration of ifns contributed to protection against coronavirus infection while delayed ifns treatment potentiated inflammatory-damage interestingly the efficient impairment of the earlier type i ifns response by coronaviruses was proposed to explain why sars-cov and mers-cov tend to have a longer incubation period up to 11 days when compared to other respiratory viruses up to 4 days for ifv lessler et al 2009 it has been demonstrated that for sars-cov-2 the response to viral infection by type i ifn is suppressed rokni et al 2020 and therefore similar to other respiratory coronaviruses the degree of immune interference would be involved in both the lung immunopathology and the extended incubation period moreover the delayed early activation of the antiviral innate immune response has been proposed to explain the sars-cov-2 transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals prompetchara et al 2020 importantly recent in vitro studies showed that sars-cov-2 is sensitive to the treatment with ifn- or ifn- demonstrating the potential efficacy of human type i ifns therapy for suppressing sars-cov-2 infection mantlo et al 2020research of the adaptive immune responses against respiratory coronaviruses strongly indicated that appropriate th1 and humoral immune responses are needed for the successful control of sars-cov and mers-cov infections prompetchara et al 2020 and probably also for sars-cov-2 studies of t cell responses in patients infected with sars-cov showed that virus-specific cd8 t cells were more frequent than cd4 t cells li et al 2008 moreover those virus-specific t cells had a polyfunctional phenotype with cd4 t cells producing ifn- tnf- and il-2 and cd8 t cells producing ifn- and tnf- and having a degranulated state of note patients resolving the infection had a strong th1 response that correlated with higher neutralizing antibodies production in contrast fatal cases of sars-cov infection showed prevalence of th2 cytokines il-4 il-5 il-10 in serum together with low production of neutralizing antibodies li et al 2008 interestingly experiments with mers-cov demonstrated the ability of the virus to down-regulate the expression of mhc-i and mhc-ii molecules in macrophages and dcs impairing antigen presentation and diminishing t cells activation shokri et al 2019 epigenetic analysis suggested that dna methylation plays a crucial role in mers-cov-mediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression menachery et al 2018 although these molecular mechanisms have not been investigated in detail for sars-cov-2 clinical studies conducted since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic have made clear the ability of this virus to affect the adaptive immunity baruah and bose 2020 li g et al 2020 rokni et al 2020 a transcriptomic study evaluating the expression of immune genes in patients suffering from covid-19 found significantly reduced levels of hla-drb1 hla-dma hla-dmb il23a and cd74 in severe cases indicating an impairment of the adaptive immune response ong et al 2020a common finding in the laboratory analysis of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is the simultaneous neutropenia and lymphopenia chen x et al 2020 huang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 shi et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang b et al 2020a zheng et al 2020 in fact the increase in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio usually indicates higher disease severity and poor clinical outcome reduced numbers of total t cells b cells and nk cells are consistently observed in patients suffering covid-19 huang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 shi et al 2020 xu et al 2020 decreased numbers of cd4 and cd8 t cells as well as increased expression of exhaustion markers such as nkg2a in nk cells and cd8 t cells have been detected in patients infected with sars-cov-2 chen x et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 in addition the strong decline of cd3cd4ifn- t cells and the tendency in the reduction of regulatory t cells was more pronounced in severe cases liu et al 2020 pedersen and ho 2020 qin et al 2020on the other hand the humoral immune response especially the production of neutralizing antibodies had a protective role against respiratory coronavirus infections neutralizing antibodies are capable of limiting the infection at a later phase and prevent reinfection in the future gorse et al 2020 studies in patients recovered from sars-cov infection demonstrated that almost 90 of them had virus-specific igg neutralizing antibodies after 2 years of the infection hsueh et al 2004 liu et al 2006 in contrast it was shown an antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection for the mers-cov wan et al 2020 in fact a neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor-binding domain of the mers-cov s protein can enhance viral entry wan et al 2020 large-scale single-cell rna sequencing of b cells isolated from convalescent patients of sars-cov-2 infections demonstrated the presence of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein specific neutralizing antibodies shen et al 2020 it was reported that patients with severe disease frequently had an increased igg response and a higher titer of total antibodies which was associated with worse outcome zhang b et al 2020b zhao et al 2020 on the contrary the convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies was used successfully to improve the outcome of critically ill patients infected with sars-cov-2 who developed ards shen et al 2020 interestingly a clinical study that investigated the characteristics of the humoral immune response in sars-cov-2-infected and uninfected children found that there was rapid production of protective antibodies after first virus exposure zhang y et al 2020b moreover the work reported that most of the sars-cov-2 specific igm switched to igg within 1 week and suggested that this efficient humoral immune response should be responsible of the milder symptoms of sars-cov-2-infected children when compared to adults these findings indicate that the type and concentration of antibodies produced in response to respiratory coronaviruses are able to affect positively or negatively the resolution of the infectionhighly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov or mers-cov predominantly infect the lower respiratory tract where they rapidly replicate inducing massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses resulting in lung injury channappanavar and perlman 2017 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020 in sars-cov-infected patients with severe disease there are high serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-12 and ifn- as well as chemokines including il-8 ccl2 cxcl9 and cxcl10 when compared to patients with uncomplicated sars channappanavar and perlman 2017 this so-called cytokine storm actively participates in the inflammatory-mediated lung injury and viral sepsis as well as in other complications including pneumonitis ards respiratory failure shock and organ failure in line with these previous findings for sars-cov or mers-cov nicholls et al 2003 wong et al 2004 mahallawi et al 2018 the presence of both lymphopenia and cytokine storm seems to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020 a study of severe cases of covid-19 hospitalized patients demonstrated high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum samples including il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ccl2 ccl3 ccl4 cxcl10 and tnf- huang et al 2020 those finding were corroborated by several subsequent studies chen c et al 2020 qin et al 2020 the transcriptional profile of whole blood samples from severe cases of sars-cov-2 infection revealed that the most up-regulated genes clustered in the toll-like receptor tlr and inflammatory response and the cytokine signaling pathways ong et al 2020 the study also concluded that expression of il1a and il1b preceded the nadir of respiratory function ong et al 2020 in addition it was reported that the peripheral blood of patients with severe covid-19 contained a significant proportion of cd14cd16 monocytes producing il-6 highlighting the role of this immune cell population in the hyper-inflammation induced by sars-cov-2 infection wen et al 2020 zhang y et al 2020arecent studies evaluating the broncho-alveolar fluid of patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection demonstrated elevated levels of the chemokines ccl2 and ccl7 which are known to be potent chemotractant for the recruitment of ccr2 monocytes zhou et al 2020 moreover single-cell rna sequencing analysis of cells from broncho-alveolar lavages collected from patients with mild or severe covid-19 indicated that the former group had significantly higher levels of inflammatory monocytes while the resident alveolar macrophage population was diminished liao et al 2020 therefore the un-regulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during sars-cov-2 infection may lead to a massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs promoting alveolar damage and diffuse thickening of the alveolar wall the cytokine storm promoted by sars-cov-2 may also participate in the tissue damage in the heart liver and kidney as well as in spleen atrophy and lymph node necrosis observed in deceased patients cao 2020in addition to changes in white blood cell populations and cytokine levels laboratory analyzes of patients infected with sars-cov-2 often show thrombocytopenia yin et al 2020 zhang b et al 2020a alterations of prothrombin time and increases in the levels of d-dimers and fibrinogen degradation products fdps huang et al 2020 yin et al 2020 zhang d et al 2020b elevation in d-dimers is reflective of increased thrombosis risk that may lead to acute coronary syndrome in covid-19 patients guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang d et al 2020 a study in which critical sars-cov-2-infeceted patients were evaluated during their attention in the intensive care unit reported elevated d-dimers and increases in fdps zhang d et al 2020b another clinical study compared hemostatic parameters between groups of sars-cov-2-inefected patients that survived or not to the infection in non-survivors higher d-dimers and fdps levels longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were observed when compared to the survivors group tang et al 2020 in both studies disseminated intravascular coagulation was observed in fatal cases han et al 2020 also reported differences in the levels of d-dimers fibrinogen and fdps when patients with milder forms of sars-cov-2 infection were compared with the severe cases interestingly the work also demonstrated diminished values of antithrombin in covid-19 patients than in healthy controlsit should be noted that the hemostatic alterations were more notable in patients requiring intensive care unit assistance guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang d et al 2020 in fact abnormal coagulation results were associated with poor prognosis of covid-19 and the existence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was common in deaths associated with this infectious disease in the points of lung injury mediated by viral replication and cytokine release there is an activation of monocytes and endothelial cells that increase their secretion of tissue factor tf and von willebrand factor these hemostatic changes results in the circulation of free thrombin activation of platelets and stimulation of fibrinolysis creating a pro-thrombotic state and secondary hyperfibrinolysis condition the disseminated intravascular coagulation mediates pulmonary congestion with microvascular thrombosis as well as other thrombosis and vascular occlusive events that are observed in critically ill covid-19 patients wang j et al 2020it was demonstrated that there is a ubiquitous expression of ace2 the viral receptor for sars-cov-2 in the luminal surface of the gastrointestinal tract particularly in enterocytes this fact has made scientists to wonder if the gastrointestinal mucosa could serve as a secondary site for sars-cov-2 infection gheblawi et al 2020 wong et al 2020 in support of this hypothesis it was shown that 5 to 10 of the patients infected with sars-cov-2 developed intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea vomiting and abdominal pain guo et al 2020 ji et al 2020 li l et al 2020 song et al 2020 wang d et al 2020 yeo et al 2020 despite the fact that the percentage of sars-cov-2-infecetd patients with intestinal symptoms is less than that found for sars-cov or mers-cov 2025 wong et al 2020 those studies suggest that sars-cov-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract the possibility that the virus may replicate efficiently in the intestinal tract opens other questions related to both its pathogenesis and its transmission studies in experimental animals in which the ace2 was disrupted demonstrated that gut dysbiosis is a prevalent finding cole-jeffrey et al 2015 oliveira et al 2020 moreover the intestinal microbial dysbiosis associated to ace2 alterations was associated to exacerbations of diabetes hypertension and pulmonary diseases cole-jeffrey et al 2015 oliveira et al 2020 in line with these findings in animal models studies performed during sars-cov outbreak in the early 2000s demonstrated that patients with viral shedding from the gastrointestinal tract had a more aggressive clinical course leung et al 2003 cheng et al 2004 some evidence also support that sars-cov-2 may induce alterations of intestine-blood barrier promoting the abnormal absorption of microbial molecules or the spread of bacteria that strongly stimulate the systemic inflammatory response contributing to multiorgan dysfunction and septic shock guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang d et al 2020 on the other hand the replication of the virus in the intestinal tract highlight the importance of fecal-oral route in sars-cov-2 transmission which could be of relevance in certain circumstances such as crowded conditions of large family groups yuen et al 2020 this has important implications to the disease management transmission and infection controlthe effect of the intestinal microbiota on the immune responses in distal mucosal sites and its impact on the outcome of respiratory infections has been explored recently in this regard some studies reported an important role for intestinal microbiota in maintaining respiratory antiviral immunity through the modulation of the immune response both at the steady state as well as in response to the viral attack ichinohe et al 2011 abt et al 2012 bradley et al 2019 remarkably most studies demonstrated a significant impact of the intestinal microbiota in the respiratory innate antiviral defense mechanisms thought its influence on a respiratory epithelial cells b respiratory dcs and c pulmonary macrophages in addition the influence of the intestinal microbiota on the antiviral innate immunity also modifies the respiratory antiviral cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses figure 2 a the influence of intestinal microbiota on the antiviral immune response mediated by respiratory epithelial cells was demonstrated by bone marrow chimera experiments which identified non-immune respiratory cells as crucially important for early antiviral immunity and their interaction with immune cells important for late antiviral resistance bradley et al 2019 it was shown that the intestinal microbiota influence the ifn- receptor ifnar surface expression in respiratory epithelial cells which in front of a respiratory virus attack are able to respond more efficiently to type i ifns stimulation with enhanced isgs levels thus the microbiota-driven ifn signature in the respiratory epithelia impedes early virus replication bradley et al 2019 b the influence of the intestinal microbiota on the antiviral immune response mediated by dcs was reported by ichinohe et al 2011 it was demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota in particular gram positive bacterial populations are involved in the appropriate distribution and activation of respiratory dcs at steady state intact intestinal microbiota support the expression of proil-1 proil-18 and nlrp3 at steady state and this inflammasome activation improve the activation and migration of dcs from the lung to the draining lymph node after the challenge with ifv this effect of the intestinal microbiota was of importance for the efficient activation of virus specific cd8 and cd4 t cells the expansion of b cells and the production of virus-specific antibodies ichinohe et al 2011 c the effect of the intestinal microbiota on the antiviral immune response mediated by macrophages was studied by abt et al 2012 it was also shown that the intestinal microbiota help to maintain the optimal functions of pulmonary macrophages the intestinal microbiota is involved in the efficient capacity of pulmonary macrophages to produce type i ifns and antiviral isgs including irf7 mx1 and oas1 to limit viral replication abt et al 2012 in addition the intestinal microbiota positively influence the ability of pulmonary macrophages to support the generation of virus-specific antibodies as well as virus-specific t cells in intestinal microbiota-depleted mice macrophages have a reduced expression of mhc-i and cd86 molecules an impaired number of ifv-specific cd8 t cells as well as a reduced ability of these cells to produce ifn- tnf- il-2 and mip-1 was also observed abt et al 2012those studies demonstrated that the signals provided by the intestinal microbiota act at multiple levels in the respiratory mucosa stimulating an antiviral state in non-immune cells and innate immune cells that would allow an efficient control of viral replication early during the infection the improved respiratory innate antiviral immune response would enhance the functionality of immune cells leading to improved humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses later in the course of viral infection figure 2 although these effects of the intestinal microbiota have been documented for ifv infection ichinohe et al 2011 abt et al 2012 bradley et al 2019 it should be considered that the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the innate antiviral immune response are not virus specific and therefore they are similar for all the respiratory viruses then it can be assumed that the beneficial microbes in the intestinal tract may favorably influence the innate immune responses to other respiratory viruses as well in this regard it was recently demonstrated that a high-fiber diet improved the production of acetate by the intestinal microbiota of mice and that this metabolic product modulated the activity of respiratory ifn- and increased the expression of isgs in the lung antunes et al 2019 the immunological changes induced in the respiratory tract by the dietary treatment significantly increased the resistance of mice to the challenge with respiratory syncytial virus rsvthe exact origin and nature of the signals used by the intestinal microbiota to modulate the respiratory antiviral immunity remain to be determined four probable mechanisms have been proposed which are not mutually exclusive to explain the effect of the intestinal microbiota on the respiratory immunity figure 2 the existence of the so-called common mucosal immune system implies that the immune cells activated in one mucosal tissue can mobilize and reach distant mucosal sites where they can influence immune responses then the mobilization of b and t cells from the intestinal mucosa to the respiratory tract could be involved in the beneficial effects exerted by the intestinal microbiota kitazawa and villena 2014 zelaya et al 2016 it was also hypothesized that immune factors such as cytokines and growth factors produced in the intestinal mucosa in response to microbiota stimulation can be released to blood and act systemically or in other mucosal tissues kitazawa and villena 2014 zhang d et al 2020a there is also evidence that microbial products can be absorbed in the intestine and circulate throughout the host macpherson and uhr 2004 clarke et al 2010 it is speculated that some microbial-associated molecular patterns mamps derived from the intestinal microbiota can be adsorbed and transported to extraintestinal sites where they stimulate prrs expressed in non-immune and immune cells influencing the immune responses perhaps the best example of this mechanism was given by clarke et al 2010 who demonstrated that the peptidoglycan translocated from the gut microbiota to the systemic circulation was detected by nod1 resulting in enhanced systemic innate immunity mediated by neutrophils in addition microbial metabolites that are adsorbed in the intestine have been associated to differential modulation of respiratory immune responses this effect has been called metabolic reprograming and implies that metabolites such as circulating short-chain fatty acids scfas trompette et al 2014 desaminotyrosine steed et al 2017 and docosahexanoic acid fonseca et al 2017 can reach innate immune cells in the respiratory tract and improve their responses to viral infectionsinterestingly the studies with germ-free as well as antibiotic-treated mice recolonized with bacteria demonstrated that the changes induced by the intestinal microbiota are reversible and more importantly tunable ichinohe et al 2011 abt et al 2012 steed et al 2017 bradley et al 2019 moreover it was shown that not all commensal bacteria could contribute equally to the immunocompetence in the lung ichinohe et al 2011 these findings have opened the possibility of exploring particular strains of beneficial bacteria with immunomodulatory capacities referred to as immunobiotics in order to increase antiviral defenses in the respiratory tract then several immunomodulatory beneficial microbial strains mainly form the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species have been tested in their capacities to modulate the respiratory antiviral immune response when orally administered reviewed in zelaya et al 2016 villena et al 2019a growing number of studies have examined the effect of immunobiotic nutritional interventions on the incidence the duration and severity of respiratory infections in humans several clinical trials systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that immunobiotics may be effective in improving the resistance of children adults and even the elderly against respiratory infections such as the common cold and influenza-like symptoms a meta-analysis of four clinical trials in which 1800 children participated demonstrated that l rhamnosus gg administration reduced incidence of acute otitis media the risk of upper respiratory infections and the days of antibiotic treatments liu et al 2013 similarly a meta-analysis of 23 double-blinded randomized and placebo-controlled trials involving more than 6000 children demonstrated that immunobiotic treatments are capable of reducing the numbers of respiratory tract infections cases days of illness per person and days absent from school compared to placebo groups wang et al 2016 interestingly immunobiotic intervention was shown to reduce the episodes of viral respiratory infections even in asthmatic children ahanchian et al 2016 the improvement of respiratory defenses were also demonstrated in healthy adults the nutritional intervention with the well-know immunobiotic strain l casei shirota was capable of diminishing the cumulative number of respiratory infectious episodes and the cumulative days with symptoms per person shida et al 2017 an increase in blood leukocyte neutrophil and nk cell counts and activity was found in shift workers treated with l casei dn-114001 the work also registered a significant reduction in the incidence of respiratory infections in dn-114001-treated adults when compared to the placebo group guillemard et al 2010a moreover the same probiotic treatment was found to diminish the incidence and severity of upper respiratory tract infections in the elderly guillemard et al 2010b middle-aged and elderly people treated with a probiotic yogurt containing l paracasei n1115 have a reduced incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infections and higher blood cd3 t cells levels were associated to the beneficial effect pu et al 2017 two independent studies conducted in healthy elderly individuals demonstrated that the administration of l delbrueckii roll1073r-1 augmented nk cells activity and reduced the risk of catching the common cold makino et al 2010although the clinical studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of immunobiotics on human respiratory infections few of them investigated specific viral etiology from the respiratory tract and reported a significant decrease in viral load lehtoranta et al 2014 on the other hand the impact of immunobiotics on the human respiratory and systemic antiviral immune responses have been clearly demonstrated in several studies in which the immunobiotic interventions acted as efficient adjuvants on ifv vaccination reviewed in zelaya et al 2016collectively research has shown that some immunobiotic strains are capable of making a difference in the hosts response to respiratory viral infections however there are variable findings in the effect of immunobiotics on respiratory tract infections in humans this fact could be related to several factors including the specific strain the duration of regimens administration forms doses and follow-up time therefore the role of immunobiotics on specific viruses needs deeper research with randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled trials in different age populations moreover the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of each particular strain have not been extensively evaluated those kind of studies are necessary to provide solid scientific basis to promote the use of immunobiotics in the prevention of respiratory viral infectionsin a randomized controlled trial in children it was demonstrated that the immunobiotic strain l rhamnosus crl1505 administered in a yogurt improved mucosal immunity and reduced the incidence and severity of viral intestinal and respiratory infections villena et al 2012b since then and for more than a decade we have dedicated our efforts to perform detailed mechanistic studies by using in vivo in vitro and in silico models to characterize the antiviral properties of l rhamnosus crl1505 figure 3 the most relevant findings of l rhamnosus crl1505s impact on mucosal antiviral immunity are summarized belowin order to study in depth the mechanisms involved in the enhancement of respiratory antiviral immunity mediated by l rhamnosus crl1505 we conducted studies in animal models using two respiratory viruses of great importance in public health rsv and ifv chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 our results showed that orally administered crl1505 strain was capable of significantly reducing viral titers in lungs lessened pulmonary damage and increased survival of mice in response to rsv chiba et al 2013 or ifv challenges zelaya et al 2014 the protective effect induced by l rhamnosus crl1505 was associated its ability to differentially modulate the innate antiviral immune response particularly to its capacity to improve the levels of type i ifns in the respiratory tract mice treated with the immunobiotic strain had significantly higher levels of ifn- in the respiratory mucosa after the nasal challenge with tlr3 agonist rsv or ifv villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 type i ifns binding to their cognate cell surface receptors activate positive feedback loops that amplifies the expression of ifns as well as hundreds of different isgs this ifns release then efficiently amplifies the expression of antiviral proteins targeting a variety of viral replication steps in uninfected bystander cells considering that l rhamnosus crl1505 was able to induce and earlier and higher production of ifn- it can be speculated that the generation of a fast and effective antiviral state in the respiratory tract could be involved the higher resistance against viral infections our group is still investigating how the orally administered crl1505 strain can modulate the expression of type i ifns and antiviral factors in the respiratory tract we have demonstrated increased numbers of cd4ifn- t in the intestine of mice orally treated with l rhamnosus crl1505 and a mobilization of these cells from the gut to the respiratory mucosa villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 then the improved production of ifn- and the subsequent stimulation dcs and macrophages in the lungs could be involved in the enhanced anti-viral state induced by l rhamnosus crl1505 figure 3 in line with this hypothesis we have recently demonstrated that orally administered crl1505 strain is able to increase the production of ifn- in cd11csiglecf alveolar macrophages which is further augmented in response to tlr3 rsv or ifv challenges submitted for publication since the activation of the innate antiviral immune response is not virus specific it is tempting to speculate that l rhamnosus crl1505 would improve the resistance to other respiratory viruses as well figure 3as mentioned above orally administered crl1505 strain induced the mobilization cd3cd4ifn- t cells from the gut to the respiratory tract increasing the local production of ifn- and stimulating antigen presenting cells villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 when lung dcs populations were evaluated in mice after the oral treatment with l rhamnosus crl1505 it was found increased levels of both cd11ccd103 and cd11ccd11bhigh dcs in addition both dcs populations showed higher expression of mhc-ii when compared with controls villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 moreover il-12 and ifn- were increased specially in cd11ccd103 dcs the antigen presenting cell population that has been associated to the generation of th1 responses in the respiratory tract kitazawa and villena 2014 the stimulation of respiratory dcs further increased the local numbers of cd3cd4ifn- t cells later in the course of rsv or ifv infections figure 3 villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013the improvement in antigen presentation would be associated not only with the higher levels of ifn- in the respiratory tract but also with the enhanced levels of type i ifns induced by the immunobiotic treatment villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 it was reported that dcs produce ifn- and ifn- and undergo maturation in response to the paracrine and autocrine actions of type i ifns moreover both ifn- have been shown to be a crucial link between innate and adaptive immunity because of their ability to stimulate dcs responses in vivo le bon and tough 2002 the treatment of dcs with type i ifns activate these antigen presenting cells enhancing their expressions of mhc-ii cd40 and cd86 molecules and improving their capacity to initiate cd4 and cd8 t cells responses montoya et al 2002 yoo et al 2010 of note we were not able to detect improved numbers of cd3cd8ifn- t cells in the respiratory tract of crl1505-treated mice after the challenges with respiratory viruses chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 further studies are necessary to find out whether the immunobiotic strain is able to positively influence other functions of cd8 t cells such as their ability to kill virus-infected cellson the other hand the improved antigen presentation mediated by l rhamnosus crl1505 could also have a beneficial effect on the respiratory humoral immune response in support of this hypothesis several other laboratories have demonstrated the ability of orally administered immunobiotics to improve respiratory and systemic humoral immune responses in front of viral infections reviewed in zelaya et al 2016 moreover although we have not evaluated the effect of orally administered crl1505 strain on the respiratory humoral immune response in the context of viral infections we have demonstrated a beneficial effect on the antibody response to streptococcus pneumoniae infection salva et al 2010 respiratory pathogen challenges results principally in an iga response in the airways while their contact with the deep lung induce an increased production of pathogen-specific igg then both types of antibodies are necessary for the full protection against respiratory pathogens in our hands the oral treatment with l rhamnosus crl1505 significantly increased the levels of anti-pneumococcal respiratory and serum iga and igg antibodies salva et al 2010 considering that the enhancement of the specific antibodies production in the respiratory tract induced by the crl1505 treatment would be the result of an improved innate immune response and a better antigenic presentation it is possible to think that the immunobiotic treatment would be also capable to generate a better humoral response against respiratory viruses in support of this hypothesis it was demonstrated that type i ifns promote antibody responses in vivo through the stimulation of dcs le bon et al 2001 it was shown that type i ifns increase the levels of antigen-specific antibodies of all subclasses of igg and induced igg2a and igg3 antibodies furthermore type i ifns combined with nasally administered ifv vaccines in immunization protocols have been shown to induce effective humoral immune responses bracci et al 2005tlr3 has a complex role in viral infections since it was reported that this prr mediated both beneficial and detrimental effects during the course of viral infections such as ifv rsv sars-cov or mers-cov rudd et al 2005 2006 groskreutz et al 2006 le goffic et al 2006 totura et al 2015 it was reported that the inflammatory lesions induced by ifv infection are diminished in the absence of tlr3 le goffic et al 2006 knockdown of tlr3 significantly reduced the infiltration of lungs with inflammatory macrophages and cd8 t cells and reduce the production of il-6 il-12 and ccl5 in response to ifv infection on the other hand it was shown that tlr3 has minimal effect on lung rsv clearance while this prr actively participates in the respiratory inflammatory damage rudd et al 2005 2006 groskreutz et al 2006 impaired regulation of tlr3 activation during the course of rsv infection increased the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promoted the infiltration of inflammatory cells rudd et al 2005 groskreutz et al 2006 and potentiated pathogenic th2-biased response in the lung rudd et al 2006 contributing to respiratory tissue damage and the alteration of lung functionality more recently it was also shown that tlr3 signaling pathway also participates in the lung inflammatory damage induced by respiratory coronaviruses infections it was reported that the knockdown of the tlr3 adaptor trif increased the susceptibility of mice to sars-cov infection totura et al 2015 mice lacking trif had an aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response and an increased infiltration of neutrophils that correlated with increased pathology of the lungthese findings highlight the importance of the appropriate regulation of the tlr3 signaling for generating a balanced protective respiratory innate immune response against viruses therefore we focused our attention in evaluating the effect of orally administered l rhamnosus crl1505 in the inflammatory immune response triggered in the respiratory tract by tlr3 activation for this purpose we utilized the artificial dsrna analog and tlr3 ligand polyic to imitate the pro-inflammatory alterations induced by viral infections in the lung nasally administered polyic to infant or adult balbc mice increases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the respiratory tract augments the inflammatory cell recruitment into the lung induces respiratory epithelial cell death and impairs the alveolar-capillary barrier stowell et al 2009 aeffner et al 2011 villena et al 2012a we observed that l rhamnosus crl1505 treatment induced quantitative and kinetic differences in the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the respiratory tract after tlr3 activation villena et al 2012a in the first hours after polyic administration the levels of respiratory tnf- and il-8 in crl1505-treated mice were similar to controls while il-6 and ccl2 were significantly higher interestingly 24 h after tlr3 activation the levels of tnf- il-6 il-8 and ccl2 were lower in crl1505-treated mice than in controls in addition respiratory il-10 in l rhamnosus crl1505-treated mice were significantly increased during all the studied period villena et al 2012a we have reported that cd3cd4il-10 t cells are the main source of the immunoregulatory cytokine in the respiratory tract during the course of viral infection chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 and that the improvement of this immune cell population is mediated by the secretion of il-6 and il-27 by alveolar macrophages submitted for publication figure 3 then our results indicated that during the early stages the production of pro-inflammatory factors would contribute to viral clearance chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 while in the later stages the reduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines together with the improved levels of regulatory cytokines such as il-10 would be critical for attenuating the inflammatory damage in the lungs induced by tlr3 activation villena et al 2012a and rsv chiba et al 2013 or ifv infections zelaya et al 2014in order to evaluate the effect of orally administered l rhamnosus crl1505 on the activation of coagulation during the course of respiratory viral infection we used polyic challenge as well as rsv and ifv infections in mice zelaya et al 2014 2016 the inflammatory response triggered by rsv or ifv infection augment the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 and il-6 that induce the secretion of tf by endothelial cells and monocytes contributing to pathology and lung tissue injury yang and tang 2016 in addition it was reported that the direct stimulation of endothelial cells with tlr3 ligands induce the up-regulation of tf and the down-regulation of thrombomodulin tm shibamiya et al 2009 moreover in vivo studies also demonstrated that administration of polyic is able to alter vascular permeability and increase the levels of d-dimers indicating that coagulation and fibrinolysis were triggered wang et al 2004 our own in vivo studies were in agreement with these previous reports since we observed that the nasal challenge of balbc mice with polyic rsv or ifv induced a marked enhancement of lung tf expression and thrombinantithrombin complex tatc levels in the respiratory tract while they reduced lung tm expression these inflammatorycoagulative modifications were accompanied by respiratory tissue alterations and impairment of lung function zelaya et al 2014 2016 we also were the first in demonstrating that orally administered crl1505 strain significantly reduced coagulation activation in blood and in the respiratory tract after the nasal challenge with polyic or respiratory viruses zelaya et al 2014 lower levels of respiratory tatc reduced expression of tf and increased expression of lung tm were found in l rhamnosus crl1505-treated mice when compared to controls in addition by using anti-il-10r blocking antibodies we demonstrated that il-10 is important for the regulation of coagulation induced by the immunobiotic crl1505 strain zelaya et al 2014 il-10 induced by l rhamnosus crl1505 administration is able to attenuate the expression of tf in inflammatory macrophages recruited in response to tlr3 activation of viral infectionwe have also advanced in the characterization of the immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of the crl1505 strain in the intestinal mucosa figure 3 in vitro studies performed in intestinal epithelial cells showed that l rhamnosus crl1505 was able to improve the production of type i interferons villena et al 2014 moreover transcriptomic studies revealed a remarkable ability of the crl1505 strain to enhance the expression of ifn- and ifn- as well as the antiviral factors nplr3 oas1 oasla mx2 and rnasel in intestinal epithelial cells when compared to other immunomodulatory lactobacilli albarracin et al 2017 2020 in vitro experiments also demonstrated that l rhamnosus crl1505 is capable of augmenting the expression of mhc-ii and cd80 and the production of ifn- in intestinal dcs and macrophages villena et al 2014 the immunological changes induced by the crl1505 strain in intestinal non-immune and immune cells correlated with the improved resistance of children to rotavirus infection villena et al 2012a we have also performed in vivo studies to evaluate the impact of l rhamnosus crl1505 on the intestinal inflammatory response triggered by tlr3 activation using a murine model of intraperitoneal challenge with polyic to induce an intestinal inflammatory response we demonstrate that oral administration of l rhamnosus crl1505 differentially modulates the intestinal antiviral immune response mediated by tlr3 and intraepithelial lymphocytes tada et al 2016 the beneficial effects of the crl1505 strain were associated with its ability to decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines including il-15 increase il-10 levels and reduce the number of cd3nk11 and cd8nkg2d cells in the intestine our results indicated that the immunobiotic treatment was capable of reducing damage to intestinal epithelial cells mediated by the tlr3-il-15-cd8nkg2d cells axis tada et al 2016 then we have conclusively demonstrated that a dietary intervention with l rhamnosus crl1505 is able to increase resistance to challenge with intestinal virus reducing viral replication and favorably modulating the inflammatory response triggered by the viral attack villena et al 2012a 2014 tada et al 2016 albarracin et al 2017 2020as stated before a clear understanding of the immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of covid-19 is vital for the rational design of effective therapies aimed to prevent or ameliorate the severity of the disease here we provided an overview of the current knowledge of the pathophysiology and the immune response to sars-cov-2 infection figure 4 in addition we have summarized the cellular and molecular information gathered during this decade of work regarding the effect of l rhamnosus crl1505 in the beneficial modulation of the mucosal antiviral immune response this comparative analysis allows us to postulate that the use of immunobiotic microorganisms such as the crl1505 strain could be beneficial in the prevention andor the reduction of the severity of infections caused by emerging respiratory viruses such as sars-cov-2 figure 4one of the most important questions asked by scientists regarding the efficacy of immunobiotics in reducing infections is whether they can be used as both preventive and therapeutic tools data from animal and clinical studies demonstrated that immunobiotic interventions are mostly effective in the prevention of respiratory infections while they rarely influence the course of infections once the pathogen has started its replication in the host zelaya et al 2016 villena et al 2019 thus in the context of the sars-cov-2 pandemic immunobiotics should be considered as a strategy to strengthen the respiratory immune system of healthy people rather than as a therapeutic option in patients who have already been infected with the virus on the other hand the characteristics of the host in which the immunobiotics are going to be applied would be also determinant for their effectiveness one of the most important findings made by clinicians and scientists since the covid-19 pandemic began is the fact that distinct population groups may react differently to sars-cov-2 infection jamilloux et al 2020 defined three phenotypes in covid-19 patients according to the infections progression and extent a patients with mild and non-specific symptoms who will not progress to severe disease mild group b patients with localized inflammation pneumonia and requiring hospitalization moderate group and c patients that develop ards systemic hyperinflammation and multiple organ failure who will require critical care management and are at risk of fatal outcome severe group children adolescents and immunocompetent adults are in the mildmoderate group which represent the 95 of the sars-cov-2-infected persons on the other hand 5 of covid-19 patients are adults with comorbidities and the elderly who are at high risk to develop severe disease jamilloux et al 2020 these two groups mildmoderate and severe greatly differ in the intensity and the kinetics of the immune responses triggered upon sars-cov-2 infection figure 5 thus we can hypothesize that the effectiveness of the nutritional interventions with immunobiotics will depend on the covid-19 phenotype group consideredit is tempting to speculate that immunobiotics would have a relevant impact on sars-cov-2 infection in the mildmoderate group as highlighted before this coronavirus is capable of both impair the innate antiviral immune response and induce a hyperactivation of the immune system however these two changes in the immune system are not simultaneous figure 5 and moreover the latter seems to ensue from the former jamilloux et al 2020 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020 the efficient viral clearance induced by the activities of type i ifns in the earlier stages of the infection is a key to prevent the viral dissemination the t cell exhaustion and the subsequent hypercytokinemia then the improved type i ifns response in the early stage of infection would be capable of avoiding viral replication or reducing the severity of the disease in support of statement it was suggested that sars-cov-2 have a lesser type i ifn antagonism compared to sars-cov perlman and netland 2009 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that sars-cov-2 displays a greater sensitivity to type i ifns than sars-cov lokugamage et al 2020 moreover mildmoderate infection by sars-cov-2 has been associated with a potent type i ifns response in the respiratory tract zhou et al 2020 and blood trouillet-assant et al 2020 the efficient management of viral infection in the early stages would also enable the generation of an adequate and timely th1 response in fact improved levels of ifn- and th1 cells in the respiratory tract have been associated to the mildmoderate disease while ifn- was not found to be elevated in the sera or respiratory tract of patients with severe forms of covid-19 xiong et al 2020 furthermore lower levels of ifn- have been proposed as marker of poorer outcomes lagunas-rangel and chvez-valencia 2020 on the other hand the rapid control of virus replication would enable the host to be protect against disease progression by limiting epithelial damage local inflammation and accumulation of pathological macrophage populations jamilloux et al 2020 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020considering that immunobiotic strains such as l rhamnosus crl1505 were shown to induce an earlier and enhanced production of type i ifns and activation of the inflammatory response in the respiratory tract in response to viral challenges followed by an improved production of ifn- by th1 cells and an efficient regulation of inflammation villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 the preventive nutritional immunobiotic intervention in the mildmoderate group could help to avoid the infection or reduce its severity and duration figure 5 in addition immunobiotics could help to diminish community sars-cov-2 virus circulation by reducing viral loads in asymptomatic patients this beneficial effect of immunobiotics could be particularly relevant since it was demonstrated that children tend not to develop severe disease despite being capable of experiencing high viral titers kam et al 2020 furthermore immunobiotics could contribute to the reduction of the circulation of other respiratory pathogens such as ifv and s pneumoniae figure 4 which increase the risk of mortality in the severe group of covid-19 patients chen n et al 2020 ding et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang j et al 2020 wu et al 2020on the other hand the potential beneficial effects of immunobiotics in the severe group must be extrapolated more carefully since in this kind of hosts the immune responses are not only conditioned by the viral infection but also by the alterations associated with the age andor the presence of other pathologies as mentioned before the most important characteristic of the response to sars-cov-2 infection in the severe group is the impaired innate antiviral response and the subsequent hyperinflammation figure 5 the cytokine storm and the exuberant inflammation lead to ards disseminated intravascular coagulation multiple organ failure and death jamilloux et al 2020 the defective or delayed first line of respiratory antiviral defense followed by the persistent production of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 il-1 and tnf- results in an increased viral replication and dissemination desquamation of alveolar cells hyaline membrane formation pulmonary edema impaired clearance of apoptotic cells by dysfunctional macrophages hemophagocytosis coagulopathy and ards chen n et al 2020 jamilloux et al 2020 merad and martin 2020 tay et al 2020 immunosuppressive therapies have been proposed for the limitation of the inflammatory damage in severe covid-19 patients individual cytokine antagonists such as blocking antibodies directed to il-1 or il-6 were found to be helpful in the recovery of some patients jamilloux et al 2020 however because of our limited understanding of the inflammatory pathways involved the severe complications of sars-cov-2 infection and the wide diversity of patients with different pathologies in the severe group some of these strategies targeting only one cytokine could have detrimental effects in certain type of patients or if they are applied in an incorrect stage of the covid-19 disease in contrast the preventive immunobiotic intervention would induce an earlier influence on several cytokines simultaneously as it has been demonstrated in animal models villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 the rapid regulation of inflammatory cytokines and the improvement of il-10 during the course of respiratory viral infections would allow a reduction of lung tissue damage and could help to delay the appearance of the most harmful effects of the infection giving more time to clinicians for applying therapies to protect patients from death figure 5 in addition immunobiotics could help to diminish the incidence andor severity of thrombotic alterations associated to the respiratory viral infection through the modulation of inflammation figure 4 in support of this hypothesis some human clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of immunobiotics to improve the immune health of patients with diseases such as type 2 diabetes obesity reviewed in sez-lara et al 2016 hypertension and cardiovascular diseases reviewed in vasquez et al 2019 however much more rigorous clinical and mechanistic studies are necessary to propose immunobiotics as palliatives for the severity of covid-19 in high-risk patientsanother potential beneficial effect of the application of immunobiotics in the prevention of sars-cov-2 infection is related to their impact on intestinal immunity diarrhea is a frequent symptom in 10 of patients infected with sars-cov-2 and increasing evidence also indicates possible fecal-oral transmission moreover some patients have diarrhea in the absence of respiratory symptoms and this may lead to underestimation of covid-19 cases reviewed in damico et al 2020 in this context considering the ability of some immunobiotic strains to improve the type i ifns response of intestinal epithelial cells the activation of intestinal antigen presenting cells as well as to beneficially regulate the inflammatory response figure 3 villena et al 2012a 2014 tada et al 2016 albarracin et al 2017 2020 preventive nutritional interventions with immunobiotics could help in reducing the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and the fecal-oral transmission figure 4 in support of this hypothesis several research works have demonstrated the efficacy of immunobiotics for improving immune responses against coronaviruses in different animals it was demonstrated that l plantarum probio-38 and l salivarius probio-37 were capable of reducing the replication of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev a highly contagious enteric pathogen in pigs in the porcine st cell line rejish kumar et al 2010 similarly enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 reduced the replication of tgev in st cells and the improved production of no il-6 and il-8 were associated to its beneficial effect chai et al 2013 a mixture of probiotic strains was also capable of strengthen the immune system of pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea ped coronavirus and improved their reproductive performance tsukahara et al 2018 interestingly it was recently reported that a multi-strain probiotic preparation significantly reduced the fecal shedding of the feline coronavirus fcov in cats naturally infected with the pathogen addie et al 2020the gastrointestinal alterations in covid-19 patients can be associated not only to viral replication but also to the disruption of the intestinal microbiota by the antibiotic treatments often necessary in this situation damico et al 2020 in this circumstance it is also plausible that immunobiotics could also be applied for the treatment of covid-19 patients in order to restore the intestinal microbiota and the optimal function of the immune system in this regard the chinas national health commission recommended the use of probiotics for the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 in order to preserve intestinal balance and to prevent secondary bacterial infections gao et al 2020finally an additional important aspect that has to be carefully considered for the potential application of a nutritional immunobiotic intervention in the covid-19 pandemic is the selection of the most appropriate immunobiotics strains various probiotic lactic acid bacteria with immunomodulatory activities have been tested in their abilities to improve the resistance to intestinal infections and only a limited number of strains were proved to be effective in the modulation of the antiviral immunity reviewed in villena et al 2016 2019 moreover most of the research related to the beneficial effect of immunobiotics on the hosts antiviral immune responses has focused on the intestinal tract while there is less scientific evidence about the capacity of immunobiotics to modulate responses in distant mucosal sites such as the respiratory tract this is probably related to the fact that immunobiotics with the ability to improve antiviral defenses in both the intestine and the respiratory tract belong to a group with a limited number of members villena et al 2016 2019 zelaya et al 2016 our own studies have clearly shown that this specific immunomodulatory property is a strain-dependent characteristic in our hands immunobiotic strains such as l plantarum crl1506 that is capable to stimulate the antiviral intestinal immunity villena et al 2012a 2014 tada et al 2016 albarracin et al 2017 was not able to influence respiratory antiviral immune responses after its oral administration villena et al 2012a chiba et al 2013 zelaya et al 2014 therefore the immunobiotic strains proposed to strengthen the populations immune system during viral epidemics or pandemics should have a strong scientific background that clearly supports their ability to modulate the mucosal antiviral immunity in addition the selection of new antiviral immunobiotic strains that have different biotechnological properties could enhance the development of various types of functional foods that could be used in nutritional immunobiotic interventions around the world to reduce the incidence and severity of intestinal and pulmonary infections caused by viruses such as the sars-cov-2 in this regard our recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that l plantarum mpl16 modulated the intestinal and respiratory antiviral immunity in a similar way as the crl1505 strain albarracin et al 2020 whereas l rhamnosus crl1505 has been used mainly in dairy functional products the mpl16 strain has shown a remarkable ability to growth and ferment wakame undaria pinnatifida that is the most popular edible brown algae in asian countries then the different biotechnological properties of immunobiotics such as l plantarum mpl16 could potentiate the development of non-dairy functional foods with the ability to improve antiviral immunity in the intestine and the respiratory tractas the sars-cov-2 pandemic expands scientists have made great advances in the knowledge of the genome characteristics and the infection biology of this virus that will allow the development of new vaccines and therapeutics in the future however in order to favorably affect the trajectory of this pandemic and mitigate as much as possible its detrimental effect on public health and economy all the available scientific resources should be put at the service of the community more than a decade of research investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the improvement of respiratory antiviral defenses by beneficial immunobiotic microorganisms clearly indicate their potential to favorably influence the immune response against sars-cov-2 virus the demonstration of ability of beneficial microorganisms to enhance type i interferons and antiviral factors in the respiratory tract stimulate th1 response and antibodies production and regulate inflammation and coagulation activation during the course of viral infections reducing tissue damage and preserving lung functionally provide solid scientific basis for proposing immunobiotic nutritional interventions to help in the strengthening of the immune system and the reduction of the incidence and severity of covid-19 in addition taking into consideration that scientists speculate that this new virus will accompany humanity from now on studies in experimental animals as well as clinical trials that conclusively demonstrate the beneficial effect of immunobiotics on sars-cov-2 infection particularly in high-risk populations could enhance their application to mitigate the virus-associated detrimental effects of the immune system if this approach is scientifically validated rapid repurposing of immunobiotics such as l rhamnosus crl1505 or l plantarum mpl16 will be effective and timely in the fight against covid-19jv and hk wrote and revised the manuscript all authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted versionthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 identified in wuhan china in december 2019 1 since then the covid-19 outbreak has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic causing a public health emergency according to the world health organization who and resulting in thousands of deaths 1 sars-cov-2 is a -coronavirus an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna virus which could be transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts to infect humans using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 2 the latter is more expressed in adults than children and thus possibly explains why the disease is more aggressive in older patients 3 covid-19 shows a heterogeneous course from patients affected by mild flu-like symptoms to patients with unremitting fever and severe respiratory involvement on this basis markers of poor prognosis have recently been investigated to effectively prioritize resources to patients with more severe symptoms 4 interestingly this study identified hyperferritinemia and interleukin il-6 as predictors of poor outcome thus suggesting a hyper-inflammatory process as the major cause of death 4 5 in severe covid-19 a specific cytokine profile resembling the pattern of a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh has been shown due to significant increases of il-2 il-7 granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf interferon- inducible protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and tumor necrosis factor tnf 6 contextualizing unremitting fever hyperferritinemia and the hyper-inflammatory process severe covid-19 shows similarity to disorders comprised in the so-called hyperferritinemic syndrome 7 this syndrome includes adult onset stills disease aosd systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia secondary hlh catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome caps and septic shock 7 hyperferritinemia is a common trait of all these forms which could be an active pathogenic mediator and not only a consequence of the inflammation 7 on these bases we aimed to review the similarities between severe covid-19 and diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome from a pathogenic clinical and therapeutic point of view thus proposing new insights to improve the management of those patientscoronavirus rnas may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns which are detected by the pattern recognition receptors and activate downstream cascades pro-inflammatory pathways 1 6 in the endosome toll-like receptor tlr 3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 may sense viral rna and dna 8 whereas in the cytoplasm the viral rna receptor retinoic-acid inducible gene i 9 cytosolic receptor melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 and nucleotidyltransferase cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate gmp-amp synthase may recognize viral rna and dna 10 consequently downstream cascades molecules are triggered involving adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary response 88 myd88 transcription factor nuclear factor-b nf-b and interferon regulatory factor 3 leading to the production of pro-inflammatory molecules 11 12 in fact plasma cytokines and chemokines were increased in covid-19 patients including il-1 il-2 il-4 il-7 il-10 il-12 il-13 il-17 gcsf ip-10 interferon- ifn- and tnf 6 during severe covid-19 these mechanisms could be exaggerated probably because of a specific genetic susceptibility 13 and these patients are characterized by very high blood levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and ferritin 4 5 the latter is an iron-binding molecule which is produced after pro-inflammatory stimuli in addition to iron availability 7 furthermore ferritin comprises 24 subunits codified according to their molecular weight into heavy feh and light fel subunits remarkably increased expression of feh and of cd68feh macrophages may be observed in inflammatory infiltrate of aosd and secondary hlh 14 15 additionally a stimulatory effect of feh on nf-kb has been described acting as a pro-inflammatory cytokine on hepatic stellate cells 16 in this work ferritin was shown to regulate an iron-independent signaling pathway that resulted ultimately in nf-kb activation 16 thus converging on the same pathway elicited by sars-cov-2 rnas 11 12 on the contrary the deletion of feh reduced the inflammatory burden in the model of sepsis by lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia cecal ligation and puncture 17 such protection was predominantly mediated by the compensatory increase in fel associated with an inhibitory action on nf-kb 17 the pro-inflammatory cytokines which are elevated in hyperferritinemic syndrome have also been described in severe covid-19 6 and may preferentially induce the expression of feh via fer2 a regulatory element acting as a binding site to nf-kb the latter in turn stimulates the synthesis of further feh and pro-inflammatory cytokines thus perpetuating a vicious inflammatory loop 7 in addition fehil-12 macrophages have been shown in the infiltrate of aosd and secondary hlh 15 18 which may further release feh following inflammatory stimuli 19 and thus contributing to the inflammatory loop 20 on these bases we hypothesize that severe covid-19 shares common pathogenic mechanisms with other diseases of hyperferritinemic syndrome 7 with ferritin enhancing the inflammatory burden and triggering a vicious pathogenic looplung involvement and hyper-inflammation are at the crossroad between severe covid-19 and the hyperferritinemic syndrome as observed in other -coronaviruses diseases covid-19 is characterized by fever dry cough increasing dyspnoea with hypoxemia and bilateral ground-glass opacities and patchy shadowing with a peripheral or posterior distribution mainly in the lower lobes on chest ct scans 6 in fact an anatomy report of a covid-19 pneumonia cadaver showed that sars-cov-2 invades the respiratory mucosa and infects other cells thus provoking an inflammatory response in the lower airway and causes lung injury 21 considering that coronavirus binds to the host cells using the ace2 receptor which is highly represented in the lower respiratory tract a persistent and repeated stimulation of tlrs in the lung may occur hence triggering an aberrant immune response and the production of a cytokine storm 22 the latter is the result of overwhelming systemic inflammation with a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines quickly progressing to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and eventually to death 23 in spite of various inflammatory etiologies cytokine release syndrome is supported by an essential underlying hypothesis the massive release of cytokines as a consequence of i excessive and repeated inflammatory stimuli and ii an inadequate regulation of inflammation iii an uncontrolled release of cytoplasmic cytokines from destroyed lymphocytes after anti-cancer therapies 23 24 in addition it has been shown that increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 il-12 ifn- ip-10 and mcp1 were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in sars patients 25 thus suggesting a further pathogenic loop in inducing the cytokine storm although the mechanisms of how covid-19 and in other more general viral infections would prompt the cytokine storm syndrome are not fully elucidated it has been suggested that the ifn- which is largely released by a variety of hematopoietic cells in response to viral infection may facilitate the occurrence of hyper-inflammation 23 in patients with sjia lung involvement may trigger systemic inflammation and the development of secondary hlh and ifn- plays a central pathogenic role 26 27 in fact in lung biopsies in patients with sija the analysis of expressed genes revealed that many of the up-regulated targets were in gene pathways related to an ifn- signature including human leukocyte antigen hlad family members and other ifn-related genes 26 27 two of the most highly up-regulated non-hla genes were chemokine c-x-c motif cxcl9 and cxcl10 26 which are ifn-induced chemokines strongly correlated with the occurrence of secondary hlh 28 in addition the lung is one of the major physiological producers of il-1 and il-6 29 which are also involved in pathogenic steps leading to the occurrence of secondary hlh 30 31 considering all of these findings it is possible to postulate that during the acute respiratory distress syndrome of covid-19 the sars-cov-2 may trigger a hyper-inflammatory reaction strongly resembling that observed in the lung involvement of sjia in which the lung acts as a trigger to amplify the immune response the final result is the uncontrolled proliferation of activated immune cells the massive production of pro-inflammatory mediators and the development of cytokine storm syndrome either in severe covid-19 or sjiafrom a clinical point of view severe covid-19 and the diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome share a fever as the main clinical symptom in these conditions the analysis of fever pattern would also suggest a useful clue to assess the severity of the disease and the occurrence of complications in sjia and aosd a typical change from the high-spiking intermittent typical quotidian pattern to a continuous unremitting pattern suggests the occurrence of secondary hlh and the worsening of the clinical situation toward a life-threatening hyper-inflammatory complication 32 during covid-19 on the basis of observations from clinicians on the frontlines the occurrence of unremitting fever would similarly identify a more aggressive subset of patients at higher risk of a poor prognosis in addition in severe covid-19 hyperferritinemia is observed suggesting a marker of severity 4 5 although it has poor specificity a 5-fould increase of ferritin is strongly suggestive of the diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome and is a useful marker to assess disease activity and to predict a poor prognosis 20 in fact hyperferritinemia is associated with increased mortality in sepsis multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and critical illness 3335 thus the clinical phenotype characterized by unremitting fever and hyperferritinemia identifies the most severe subset of covid-19 as observed in the diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndromeconsidering the lack of efficacy of antiviral therapy for severe coronavirus infection it is reasonable to postulate the clinical usefulness of specific immunomodulatory therapies figure 1 as observed for other diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome such as intravenous immunoglobulins ivigs and tocilizumab the humanized monoclonal antibody against il-6 receptor 7 ex juvantibus one of the best criteria for identifying a common pathogenic mechanism among different diseases is that the clinical manifestations were reversed upon initiation of the same therapy it has been shown that after ivigs therapy a significant reduction of hyperferritinemia both in sepsis and secondary hlh was observed correlating with an improvement in patients 7 considering their proposed anti-viral activity possibly comprising many cross-reacting anti-viral antibodies and per se immunomodulatory activities 36 ivigs has also been proposed to treat severe covid-19 37 another therapeutic immunomodulatory possibility in severe covid-19 is the administration of hydroxychloroquine hcq this drug has been a licensed treatment for rheumatoid arthritis for many years and was shown to reduce the viral load favoring the disappearance of sars-cov-2 38 however although it seems promising a recent meta-analysis including 1358 patients suggested that more data are required for a definitive conclusion on the use of hcq in this setting since no difference was observed in virologic cure death or clinical worsening of disease between hcq-treated patients and control groups 39 as far as tocilizumab is concerned the rationale for its use in severe covid-19 derived from evidence of its beneficial effect on cytokine release syndrome this is a clinically significant on-target off-tumor side effect of the chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapies administered for treatment of malignancies 24 characteristics of cytokine-release syndrome include fever encephalopathy hypotension and coagulopathy leading to multiorgan failure associated with very pronounced levels of hyperferritinemia and il-6 24 the latter provided an effective therapeutic target in cytokine release syndrome 40 mirroring this finding tocilizumab has been used to treat severe covid-19 with promising results as observed in other diseases of hyperferritinemic syndrome 7 furthermore a reduction of ferritin obtained by combing immunomodulatory drugs was associated with a lower mortality rate in caps and hlh 7 thus possibly suggesting the use of in a more aggressive subset of covid-19 a combination therapy with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs at the same time 41 in addition the repurposing of these drugs in severe covid-19 could benefit from the findings of previous reports and thus on this basis many clinical trials are ongoing in different countries chictr2000029765 nct04317092 nct04310228 and nct04332913as far as other immunomodulatory strategies in covid-19 are concerned il-1 inhibition showed benefits in sepsis in which both hyperferritinemia and hyper-inflammation may be observed contributing to the dysregulation of the host immune system 42 a post-hoc analysis of data from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial showed some improvement of patients with sepsis following anakinra a recombinant non-glycosylated form of human il-1 receptor antagonist thus suggesting its possible use in those patients 42 as a consequence it is possible to hypothesize that anakinra may also relieve severe covid-19 reported data suggest the possible efficacy of emapalumab a monoclonal antibody neutralizing ifn-y approved in the treatment of hlh and its massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 43 due to the important role of ifn-y in driving hyper-inflammation during viral infections emapalumab may be an additional immunomodulatory therapy that could be employed in the treatment of severe covid-19 in addition available literature suggests that janus kinase jak inhibition might affect covid-19 twice as much by targeting both inflammation and cellular viral entry 44 it has been proposed that baricitinib a jak1jak2 inhibitor may control the hyper-inflammatory steps in those diseases characterized by a cytokine storm since a plethora of cytokine receptors indiscriminately use these jaks as mediators of ligands binding and consequent activation of the inflammatory cascade 45 furthermore the disruption of p2-associated protein kinase 1 a known regulator of viral endocytosis into the cell by baricitinib could possibly be an additional positive effect in covid-19 decreasing the viral entry 44 finally considering ferritin as a pathogenic mediator this could also be proposed as a therapeutic target in these conditions high-volume hemofiltration and plasma exchange extracorporeal blood purification techniques have been employed to treat secondary hlh to sepsis 4648 interestingly in parallel with the clinical efficacy these procedures induce a ferritin reduction 4648 suggesting that the mechanical removal of ferritin could have a possible therapeutic rolein this work we discuss the similarities from a pathogenic clinical and therapeutic point of view between severe covid-19 and four conditions secondary hlh aosd caps and septic shock which are included in hyperferritinemic syndrome all these diseases are characterized by very high levels of ferritin which could not only be the product of the inflammation but rather may play a pathogenic role possibly in an inflammatory environment as observed in these diseases hyperferritinemia may be involved in a vicious pathogenic loop prompting its pro-inflammatory properties in severe covid-19 ferritin could be a further possible enhancer of the cytokine storm clinically unremitting fever is a common feature of severe covid-19 suggesting that a change from the intermittent quotidian pattern to a continuous unremitting form would indicate a worsening toward the cytokine storm as in aosd and sjia the hyperferritinemia seems to be a marker of poor prognosis and response to treatment in both severe covid-19 and hyperferritinemic syndrome finally the good response to immunomodulatory therapies observed during severe covid-19 strongly supports the link between this form and other diseases included in hyperferritinemic syndrome in addition targeting the hyper-inflammatory process through immunomodulatory therapies decreases the high mortality rate of all these diseases 7 4951 thus proposing additional therapeutic options to improve the survival of severe covid-19 patients the latter characterized by an over-exuberant pro-inflammatory response in which the viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms 6in conclusion we hypothesize that severe covid-19 shares pathogenic mechanisms a clinical picture outcomes and therapeutic strategies with disorders included in hyperferritinemic syndrome the hyperferritinemia characterizing all these diseases may be a pathogenic mediator enhancing the inflammatory burden and as observed in aosd caps and secondary hlh its reduction is associated with a lower mortality thus at present severe covid-19 seems to be a new entity in hyperferritinemic syndrome in addition since accumulating evidence suggests that severe covid-19 is associated with a cytokine storm syndrome therapeutic strategies combining immunomodulatory therapies may improve the management of those patients furthermore in this setting high levels of ferritin identifying a more aggressive subset of covid-19 may drive clinicians to apply more aggressive therapies and resources in those patients thus balancing appropriate escalation of therapy and minimizing the exposure to iatrogenic harm sars-cov-2 and consequent covid-19 are a

financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestsince late 2019 the world has come to terms with the fact that it is facing a major public health crisis against the novel coronavirus disease termed covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as of may 10th there are over four million confirmed cases of covid-19 and almost 280000 deaths globally 1 the first known case of covid-19 originated from the city of wuhan in hubei province china from there it has spread to every inhabited continent worldwide the virus originates from a large class of viruses known as -coronaviruses common in nature with many potential natural primary intermediate and final hosts 2 sars-cov-2 figure 1 is an enveloped positive-sense rna virus that typically affects the respiratory system whereby the main known route of transmission occurs due to the spread of droplets generated when an infected person sneezes or coughs or through other mucus environments including saliva or discharge from the nose 3 sars-cov-2 gains entry to the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 456789101112 whereby it predominantly infects the lower respiratory tract binding to ace2 on alveolar epithelial cells 13 upon binding there is a subsequent response of the immune system via inflammation-related manifestations and recruitment of antigen-presenting cells 101112 the infectious capacity of the virus in conjunction with the high fatality rates 15 has left the world scrambling to bring the pandemic under control 67891415 covid-19 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic infection or patients can present with a mild upper respiratory tract illness that may include a cough chills fever fatigue and shortness of breath 15 in severe cases the most common complications are sepsis acute respiratory distress syndrome ards heart failure and septic shock however severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure can potentially lead to death 16 multiple organ dysfunction is likely attributable to uncontrolled acute inflammation and cytokine storm release 101112171819 as our knowledge of the disease is evolving it is clear that other symptoms are being identified including chilblains 20 sudden anosmia or ageusia 21 and even stroke 22the inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the clinical manifestations of covid-19 post sars-cov-2 entry host factors trigger an immune response against the virus which if uncontrolled may result in pulmonary tissue damage functional impairment and reduced lung capacity 1011 damage to the pulmonary interstitial arteriolar walls indicates that an inflammatory response plays an important role throughout the course of the disease despite the pathogenic effect of the virus 1011 apart from nonspecific inflammatory responses such as edema and inflammatory cell infiltration severe exfoliation of alveolar epithelial cells alveolar septal widening damage to alveolar septa and alveolar space infiltration has been detected in a distinctly organized manner 1011 thus sars-cov-2 infection can cause pathological changes degeneration infiltration and hyperplasia 10apart from respiratory failure other common features amongst critical covid-19 patients include a sudden decline of the patients health status approximately two weeks after onset 11 infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into lung lesions a decrease of lymphocytes such as natural killer nk cells in peripheral blood extremely high levels of inflammatory response due to the proinflammatory cytokine storm atrophy of the spleen and lymph nodes along with reduced lymphocytes in lymphoid organs hypercoagulability thrombosis and multiple organ damage 1124 these are just a selection of the clinical manifestations that occur as the medical community begins to learn more as the pandemic continues to grow it is therefore apparent that a viral infection-related inflammation and the subsequent cytokine storm in severe cases plays a crucial role in patient outcomes 10111217 furthermore the coexistence of noncommunicable chronic diseases ncds in covid-19 patients may aggravate and intensify the inflammatory pathology and increase the risk for adverse outcomes and mortality 25 this is evident in those at high risk of cvd who may also be at high risk for severe covid-19 infections due to high angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 expression observed in these patients 4789 currently there is a worldwide effort to rapidly diagnose and isolate covid-19 patients while scientists congruently search for and repurpose therapies and interventions that are able to counter the most severe effects of the disease 26 while some therapeutic agents look promising there is currently no evidence of safety and efficacy in human trials for any proposed treatment for covid-19 27 therefore an understanding of the mechanisms involved in these manifestations may facilitate the development of targeted anti-inflammatory therapies however it is important to recognize that our understanding of the pathomechanisms of covid-19 are continually evolving equally it is important to determine prophylactic interventions to prevent or lower the incidence of infection to date the most effective mitigation strategies being implemented globally consist of encouraging standard public health practices such as regular hand washing with soap wearing a face mask 28 and covering a cough with your elbow 29 along with introducing social distancing measures stay in place guidelines expansive testing and contact tracing 3031 however it has been postulated that a healthy nutritional status may support immune function and prevent the onset of a severe infection 32333435 which leads to the question of whether maintaining a healthy nutritional status is warranted at this time to prime the immune systems of individuals not infected with covid-19 in light of the ongoing public health emergency a review of pharmacological and nutritional strategies to support the optimization of immune health seems both timely and worthwhile therefore the aims of this review are to give an overview of some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are under investigation and intended to dampen the inflammatory response in severe covid-19 infections and to outline dietary considerations implicated in immune function and respiratory illness outcomes as they may influence patient outcomes in severe covid-19 infectionsthe first step in the host cell viral entry is the binding of the viral trimeric spike protein of sars-cov-2 to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is similar to sars-cov-1 infection mechanisms 6789 although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with sars-cov-1 the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 differs in several key amino acid residues allowing for a stronger binding affinity with the human ace2 receptor which may account for the greater pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 736 although ace2 expression correlates with susceptibility to sars-cov-1 infection the relationship between ace2 expression levels and the susceptibly to sars-cov-2 infection remains unclear 37when sars-cov-2 infects the respiratory tract it can cause mild respiratory infections or severe acute respiratory syndrome with consequent inflammatory responses 101112 during covid-19 infection the virus infects antigen-presenting cells macrophages and dendritic cells which present sars-cov-2 antigens to t cells leading to t cell activation differentiation and a subsequent enormous cytokine release 10 the host innate immune system detects viral infections by using pattern recognition receptors prrs including toll-like receptors tlr to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps like lipoproteins proteins lipids and nucleic acids of viral origin 1038 subsequently there is the activation of transcription factors nf-kb irf3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases mapks pathways that induce the expression of inflammatory factors 39 for example the binding of sars-cov-2 to the tlr causes the release of pro-il-1 which is cleaved by caspase-1 followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature il-1 which is a mediator of lung inflammation fever and fibrosis 12mast cells mcs that are present in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms and they can be virus-activated activation of mcs release early inflammatory molecules such as histamine and proteases while late activation triggers the production of proinflammatory il-1 family members including il-1 il-6 and il-33 4these processes lead to t cell activation and differentiation including the production of cytokines of various t cell subsets followed by a massive release of cytokines involved in immune response amplification 1040 t cells of the adaptive immune system play an important antiviral role by balancing the battle against pathogens and the risk of overwhelming inflammation or developing autoimmunity 41 helper t cells such as the cd4 promote the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating t-dependent b cells while other t cells such as the cd8 are cytotoxic and can kill viral-infected cells 10 in addition t helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the nf-kb signaling pathway which in turn recruits lymphocytes and leukocytes such as monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection with a subsequent secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines from all these immune cells to amplify the inflammatory response to the virus infection 1042 the extensive and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines is termed the cytokine storm clinically the cytokine storm commonly presents as systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure 11 clinical evidence has shown that severe covid-19 patients have an elevated cytokine profile reminiscent of a cytokine storm as previously observed in sars-cov-1 and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers 11 the level of inflammatory factors in patients with covid-19 are increased among which are il-1ra il-1b il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf ifn- fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon--inducible protein ip10 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a platelet-derived growth factor pdgf monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp1 vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and tumor necrosis factor tnf- furthermore levels of il-2 il-6 il-7 il-10 ip10 g-csf mcp1 mip1a and tnf- were higher in critically ill patients with covid-19 than that in mild groups 111243in the majority of severe covid-19 patients the cytokine storm was associated with high levels of erythematosus sedimentation rate esr and c-reactive protein crp which were associated with ards hypercoagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation dic presenting as thrombocytopenia thrombosis and gangrene of the limbs it is possible that the cytokine storm may exacerbate lung damage 1144 blanco-melo et al 45 determined that the unique inappropriate inflammatory response of covid-19 is due to the low levels of type i and ii interferons in conjunction with an elevated expression of il-6 and increased chemokines they hypothesize that the enhanced inflammatory response along with a reduced innate antiviral defense may be the defining and driving feature of covid-19 infections although the lungs are considered the main target organ of sars-cov-2 the virus can affect many other organs including the heart and blood vessels the kidneys the gut and brain through various mechanisms 46 it has been widely proposed that one of the ways the virus can critically affect these organs is through an intense inflammatory reaction while other mechanisms have yet to be elucidated for instance it is now documented that covid-19 patients may be predisposed to arterial and venous thromboembolisms due to excessive inflammation diffuse intravascular coagulation and hypoxia in a dutch study of covid-19 patients one-third exhibited blood clots 47 therefore antiplatelet agents may be considered to treat covid-19 overall considering inflammation plays a significant role in covid-19 pathology it would seem logical that it would be important to control cytokine production given that they are responsible for the accumulation of immune cells and fluids as such anti-inflammatory treatments may hold promise for the management of covid-19 complicationsclassic first-line antiviral treatments are a potential therapeutic against covid-19 which when concomitant with organ function support are very important to reduce mortality for mild and critical patients 1148 antiviral therapy against sars-cov-2 consists of using different polymerase inhibitor drugs that are currently on the market and approved for use against other viruses these include ribavirin remdesivir sofosbuvir galidesivir and tenofovir 48 these antiviral drugs have previously exhibited anti-inflammatory properties either individually or combined as highly active antiviral therapies however the long-term use of some of these antiviral therapeutics against other persistent viral infections has been associated with inflammation-related cardiovascular side effects 4950 researchers are also targeting inflammation through the investigation of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapies to reduce systemic inflammation before the onset of multiorgan dysfunction 1151 therefore biological agents targeting cytokines expression and specific cytokine antagonists such as il-6r monoclonal antibodies tnf inhibitors il-1 antagonists janus kinase inhibitor jak inhibitors etc have been considered 11 adopting an approach against specific cytokines entails the danger of only inhibiting one aspect of the inflammatory pathways involved as a consequence it may not be very effective in curbing the cytokine storm in covid-19 as various cytokine pathways are of significant importance and immunosuppression may actually compromise host defenses 5253 furthermore some of these specified anti-inflammatory medications such as jak inhibitors may also block the production of the antiviral interferons such as the inf-a which may have negative consequences for the immune response 1154researchers are also investigating the possible effects of antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-2 these molecules are generally prescribed for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in patients whose disease status has not improved with other treatments however chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess a broad spectrum of antiviral effects against several viral infections including coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 113748495556 in vitro experiments in china identified chloroquine as a promising therapeutic against sars-cov-2 5657 while the immunomodulatory effects of its derivative hydroxychloroquine may be more effective at targeting the cytokine storm that occurs in the late phase of critically ill covid-19 infected patients with less side effects 5558hydroxychloroquine interferes with lysosomal activity and autophagy and alters transcription and signaling pathways which can result in the modulation of cytokine production 59 all of which are postulated to dampen the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine storm of severe covid-19 patients furthermore hydroxychloroquine has been reported to have better outcomes when combined with other drugs such as antibiotics like azithromycin or drugs used for rheumatoid arthritis such as tocilizumabatlizumab in addition to the standard medical management for septic shock and ards 60 notably some antibiotics including azithromycin have exhibited anti-inflammatory potency 516162 while tocilizumabatlizumab contains a humanized monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor thus it is mainly used for reducing inflammation during autoimmune disorders 63hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin has been particularly focused upon due to the results of a french study where 26 covid-19 patients received the combination treatment versus control groups however there were several issues with the study design including its small sample size the fact that the control groups were from different hospitals the study was not blinded and a myriad of other issues 64 while the study provided an indication that hydroxychloroquine was worth further investigation its results have been blown out of proportion in the media hydroxychloroquine has even been prematurely touted as a game-changer by president donald trump of the united states who has admonished that he may even consider taking this untested drug against covid-19 65 some countries have allowed compassionate use of these drugs 6667 the promotion of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without substantial evidence of randomized controlled trials is a significant safety and efficacy concern and requires further intensive investigation 686970 currently a study from the united states veterans health administration indicated that patients administered hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin were no less likely to require mechanical ventilation and had higher mortality when on hydroxychloroquine alone versus the standard treatment 71 this example demonstrates the necessity for world leaders to consult with their experts prior to promoting unproven medications against sar-cov-2 as a matter of public safety until further research is conductedseveral researchers mention the relationship of anti-cvd-related drugs with covid-19 indeed there is a focus on the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine which has been previously used effectively against cardiovascular disorders 72 since ace2 is implicated in covid-19 infection the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceisangiotensin receptor blockers arbs of the ace2 receptor and its rennin-angiotensin system which are typically used for hypertension has recently been evaluated 78937 aceisarbs perform a protective role in the cardiovascular system by also increasing the expression ace2 in the heart 37 however the impact of aceisarbs on ace2 in other organs especially whether they could influence the expression level and activity of ace2 in the lungs with a subsequently higher susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection remains unknown thus if aceisarbs have the capacity to upregulate the expression and activity of ace2 in the lungs they may play a dual role in covid-19 on one hand the higher level of ace2 might increase the susceptibility of cells to sars-cov-2 viral host entry and propagation whereas on the other hand the activation of ace2 might ameliorate the acute lung injury induced by sars-cov-2 377374 despite these concerns the european society of cardiology recommends that patients continue their usual antihypertensive medications due to lack of evidence 75 this also may have dietary implications due to the modulatory effects dietary patterns can have on hypertension but also due to the fact that some foods are associated with high levels of ace inhibitory peptides 76 thus further research is required to investigate the role of ace2 activation expression and its related pathways in covid-19as aforementioned implementing an anti-inflammatory strategy is challenging as it is not yet clear if any specific features of the immune response can be inhibited directly without compromising a patients overall immune defense 52 it is important to determine the optimum method to reduce inflammation further research is also required to gain an understanding of the temporal features of the covid-19 inflammatory response and to determine at what stage of the infection should pharmaceutical treatments be administered similarly an understanding of the dosing and sexual dimorphism in drug metabolism and disease presentation is required likewise ethnicity may be a determining factor in severe covid-19 infections that requires further investigation 7778furthermore considering an increased risk of clot development can turn mild cases into more severe and life-threatening emergencies a preventative approach targeting thrombosis should also be considered 47 particularly those that may also target inflammation 79 reactive oxygen species ros also play a crucial role in the inflammatory response as such utilizing compounds with antioxidant properties may also be considered to reduce the cytokine storm induced by the viral infection 80 indeed antioxidative therapies are being considered for ameliorating cardiac injuries in critically ill covid-19 patients 81among other measures the nutritional status of an infected patient should also be considered as nutritional deficiencies may increase a patients risk to developing a severe infection of covid-19 82 introducing nutritional interventions should not be overlooked due to their potential for beneficial clinical outcomes 83 in particular consideration must be given to intensive care unit icu patients 84 on 23rd march 2020 the world health organization who issued guidelines to highlight that those diagnosed with noncommunicable diseases ncds may be more susceptible to developing covid-19 figure 2 2585the link between viral infection severity and ncds has been observed in other viral infections such as influenza 86 chronic and unresolved inflammation is implicated in the onset progression and development of ncds 8788 furthermore it is thought that underlying systemic inflammation may exacerbate covid-19 infection 85 for instance in covid-19 patients with underlying cvd the respiratory symptoms of infection seem to be more severe 89 data from the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc demonstrates the high risk of mortality in individuals with pre-existing health conditions 90 considering patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure exhibit damage to the blood vessels the existence of increased thrombotic complications in covid-19 may account for the higher risk of serious disease in these patients 46 certainly diabetes is a significant risk factor for covid-19 91 and is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality and potential disease severity 92generally where possible an effective strategy to reduce ones risk of developing ncds is to control the activities of inflammatory mediators via modifiable risk factors such as diet exercise and healthy lifestyle choices 8793 only the adoption of a long-term and consistent dietary pattern benefits human health conversely adoption of an unhealthy diet and lifestyles is associated with low-grade inflammation and increased oxidative stress which could lead to the development of ncds 8794 certainly there is considerable evidence that the food and nutrients we consume affect how our immune system functions 349596 the role of nutrition amidst the current global pandemic will be discussed in section 5some reports 2590 have suggested that a higher body mass index bmi or excess adiposity carry risk factors for complications arising from covid-19 infection this may be due to a higher prevalence of pulmonary problems in obese populations relative to their healthy weight counterparts 97 patients with obesity and comorbidities that compromise their heart or lung function are likely at higher risk for developing severe diseases with covid-19 14 much like the nonobese patients with those risk factors maintaining a body weight and composition in line with recommendations 98 for stature and gender among other considerations such as comorbid disease or athletic discipline is prudentvarious dietary patterns have been linked to the risk of inflammatory conditions 116 and respiratory disease 117 one diet synonymous with anti-inflammatory properties is the mediterranean diet which is characterized by a relatively high dietary intake of minimally processed fruit vegetables legumes olive oil whole grains nuts and monounsaturated fats followed by low-to-moderate consumptions of fermented dairy products fish poultry wine and lastly low consumptions of processed and red meats 87118 a balanced diet rich in these foods is associated with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compounds including essential vitamins c d and e and minerals zinc copper calcium etc that affect a persons nutritional status 119 several foods associated with the mediterranean diet and other healthy dietary patterns contain bioactive compounds that go beyond just vitamins and minerals including bioactive phenolic compounds polar lipids and peptides with potent anti-inflammatory antithrombotic and antioxidant properties these molecules can synergistically act to prevent and protect against inflammatory manifestations and associated thrombotic and ros-related complications 87120121122123124therefore healthy dietary patterns such as the mediterranean diet or similar are beneficial against ncds but potentially also against infections such as covid-19 due to their effects on immune health 87125126 the traditional mediterranean diet has been found to have protective effects for allergic respiratory diseases in epidemiological studies 127 and for inflammatory conditions 116128 overall much of the benefits of the mediterranean diet has to do with the high intake of a wide range of bioactive compounds that come from all aspects of the diet 87129130 and the relatively low intake of overly processed foods associated with negative health effects such as that of the western diet 131 of course it is the ideals of the mediterranean diet that are important to follow as a traditional mediterranean diet is practically nonexistent these days and countries of the mediterranean follow a diet more closely related to the western diet than that of their ancestors 129 most national dietary guidelines follow similar principals to the mediterranean diet by promoting the intake of fruit and vegetables etc in large quantities and advise that people limit their intake of processed foods the western dietary pattern prevalent in developed countries is characterized by high consumptions of processed foods such as refined grains cured and red meats desserts and sweets deep-fried foods and high-fat products 132 as a result there is a high intake of sugars saturated fats and refined carbohydrates that may be associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia consequently there is a high prevalence of type ii diabetes mellitus and obesity thus potentially putting these particular populations at increased risk for severe covid-19 complications 133 the western diet is highly associated with hyperglycemia and advanced glycation end products ages that are linked with inflammation metabolic complications and chronic disease 134 notably hyperglycemia is a risk factor associated with high mortality in patients with severe covid-19 infection 135 this pattern of intake has also been associated with an increased risk of asthma in children 136 in adults a western diet has been shown to be positively associated with an increased frequency of asthma exacerbation 137 this dietary pattern is also associated with other inflammatory conditions 138 due to the relative absence of the beneficial nutrient components that are present in the mediterranean diet and other healthy dietary patterns similarly before the pandemic the advice was that people should avoid following dietary patterns consistent with the western diet due to the profound negative health effects associated with its adherence including the development of ncds and the promotion of a low-grade inflammatory state fruit and vegetable intakes have been investigated for potential benefits in association with respiratory 139 and inflammatory 140 conditions due to their nutrient profile consisting of antioxidants vitamins minerals and phytochemicals that include phenolic compounds that can exert antioxidant anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects 123141142 indeed polyphenols may also exhibit antiviral effects against the west nile virus zika virus and dengue virus 143144 a recent umbrella review of research on fruits vegetables and health 145 provides support for the dietary recommendation to consume four or more servings per day in this context however excessive intakes may also displace other valuable foods potentially leading to nutrient deficiencies of some vitamins or minerals not found in these foods for example zinc is more prevalent in meat or dairy products fruits and vegetables are also sources of fiber important for gut health many of the beneficial components of fruits and vegetable will be further discussed in section 53 fish and fish oils have been associated with various health benefits against numerous ncds including cvd and cancer 146147148149 omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa namely eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha from fish other marine sources and supplements have been shown to be anti-inflammatory through several cellular mechanisms including their incorporation into cellular membranes and resulting altered synthesis of eicosanoids 146147 li et al 148 reviewed 89 systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating fish intake and all-cause mortality concluding that fish intake at 24 servings per week is associated with the largest risk reduction however despite these potential positive effects there is conflicting evidence in relation to fish or fish oil consumption for some viral infections in influenza models fish oil-fed mice demonstrated impaired resistance to influenza infection due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties which negatively dampened the immune response of the mice against the infection 150 indeed in another mouse model fish oil intake delayed influenza virus clearance and impaired the immune response in the lungs of mice by disrupting interferon- and immunoglobulin a 151 a further study indicated that it may be due to the impairment of virus-specific t lymphocyte cytotoxicity 152 however substantial human trials in this area are lacking in contrast epa and dha may act as substrates for the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators such as maresins resolvins and protectins of which protectins may reduce the replication of influenza 153 and potentially affect the inflammatory manifestations of respiratory viral diseases 154 although their synthesis via fish oil supplementation in humans requires further investigation as there are differing reports of their clinical relevance 79155156prostaglandins thromboxanes and leukotrienes are proinflammatory molecules formed from arachidonic acid aa suppressing prostaglandin synthesis by targeting the cyclooxygenase enzymes cox-1 and cox-2 with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids reduces inflammation pain and fever however using cox-12 inhibitors in some viral infections such as influenza a may have differential and potentially negative effects as demonstrated in vivo 157 previously it was shown that sars-cov-1 could bind with the cox-2 promotor increasing its expression 158 however it is not currently known whether nsaids may be beneficial or lead to more severe covid-19 symptoms as prostaglandins such as prostacyclin pgi2 prostaglandin e2 pge2 and prostaglandin d2 can both reduce and induce inflammation 159 certainly it has been suggested that selective inhibition human microsomal prostaglandin e synthase 1 mpges-1 may be a viable therapeutic target for sars-cov-2 160 while it is known that n-3 fatty acids can beneficially interact with the cox enzymes 146161 it also is not clear if fish or fish oil consumption may be beneficial against sars-cov-2 infectionin terms of dietary strategies it is known that marine n-3 pufa can replace aa in the phospholipids of cell membranes thus affecting eicosanoid and prostaglandin synthesis indeed the supplementation of epa and dha raises the level of these fatty acids in the phospholipids of cells involved in inflammation in a time and dose-dependent fashion at the expense of aa 146 there is the potential that aa epa dha and other dietary unsaturated fatty acids can inactivate enveloped viruses it is thought that these fatty acids and others cause leakages or lysis of the viral envelopes by disrupting the membrane integrity amongst other potential mechanisms 162163164165 indeed alveolar immune cells such as macrophages leukocytes natural killer cells and b and t cells release unsaturated fatty acids such as aa into the surrounding microenvironment when challenged by viruses including sars-cov-1 mers and potentially sars-cov-2 162 notably an in vitro model of human cells huh-7 and veroe6 infected with a human coronavirus hcov-229e demonstrated that several bioactive lipids downstream of phospholipase a2 pla2 activation were upregulated by the host cells it is postulated that coronaviruses modulate the host lipid profile to optimize and maintain a specific homeostasis for viral replication however exogenous supplementation of aa and linoleic acid suppressed viral replication by interfering with the optimal host lipid conditions for viral replication notably exogenous supplementation of aa and linoleic acid was also conserved when human cells were infected with mers 166 epa dha and aa also inhibited the replication of enterovirus a71 and coxsackievirus a16 167 while it is suggested that the oral or intravenous administration of various bioactive lipids could potentially reduce the severity andor enhance the recovery of those infected with covid-19 162 a dietary prophylactic approach or a dietary strategy for recovering patients is also worth considering further research is certainly required as increasing aa via the diet might seem counterintuitive as it is mainly proinflammatory and it is associated with the western diet 168 but epa and dha could be consideredmost fish oil studies were conducted using epa and dha which have previously exhibited immunomodulatory effects 169 but it is worth noting that other lipid molecules in fish including polar lipids exhibit anti-inflammatory effects through differing mechanisms by modulating the activities and metabolism of the potent proinflammatory and prothrombotic mediator platelet-activating factor paf 146170 certainly paf and its receptor paf-r are known to be involved several ncds 87 and viral infections such as hiv 50 dengue virus 171172 respiratory syncytial virus 173 and lung injury caused by influenza a 174 indeed a lipidomic analysis of in vitro human cells infected with a coronavirus hcov-229e demonstrates a 35-fold elevation of paf levels 166 blockade of the paf-r pathways with paf antagonists prevented severe disease manifestations in the dengue virus 171 similarly paf-r antagonism in mice suffering influenza a induced protection against lung injury and mortality 174 in addition evidence in humans shows that highly active antiretroviral therapy with anti-paf effects may attenuate paf metabolism in the blood of hiv patients 4950 paf-r antagonists have also been investigated for their anti-inflammatory effects in hiv-1-associated neurocognitive disorders 175 therefore dietary paf inhibitors such as polar lipids in fish 146 or even other dietary sources 147176177178 may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial in viral diseases and ncds as opposed to pufa esters or fatty acids that act through differing mechanismsfish and other foods also contain polar lipids that exhibit potent antithrombotic effects against paf and other prothrombotic pathways including thrombin collagen and adenosine diphosphate adp 146179180 other bioactive compounds in fish such as peptides may also prevent against thrombosis the generation of ros and hypertension 124181 therefore increasing fish consumption may provide the nutrients and bioactive molecules that may influence some of the pathomechanisms and complications of covid-19 such as inflammation and thrombosis currently 24 g of n-3 fatty acids seem to be physiologically relevant against hypertension inflammation and thrombosis however even higher doses have been suggested 146182183184 studies are warranted to discern whether fish consumption may beneficially support immune function against covid-19 vitamin c ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin the consumption of which has been part of cultural practice when suffering with a cold or flu for decades this is due to research published by nobel prize winner linus pauling circa 1970 theorizing how vitamin c helps to treat colds 185 an analysis of 29 studies including 11306 participants concluded that supplementing with 200 mg or more of vitamin c does not reduce the risk of contracting a cold 186187 however regular vitamin c supplements had several benefits includingreduced cold severity they reduced the symptoms of a cold making it less severereduced cold duration supplements decreased the recovery time by 8 in adults and 14 in children on average 187indeed a supplemental dose of 12 g was enough to shorten the duration of a cold by 18 in children on average 186 despite much of the research on vitamin c intake being conducted using supplements vitamin c can also be obtained through dietary sources such as citrus fruits berries brassicas leafy greens tomatoes and various other fruits and vegetables fresh fruit consumption high in vitamin c even at low levels was associated with a reduction of wheezing symptoms in children in a cross-sectional study 188 interestingly most studies examining vitamin c intakes fail to account for dietary vitamin c intakes in their trial design 189 potentially contributing to the disparity of outcomes observed at a grand scale 186 as reviewed by hemil 190 there is a dose-concentration relationship whereby healthy individuals may not benefit from supplementation if the dietary intake of vitamin c is 200 mgday however this does not apply to all situations and certainly not in the case of patients with infections as they have lower vitamin c levels due to alterations in the metabolism 190 although evidence is currently weak in relation to the utility of vitamin c against covid-19 infections 191 there was sufficient evidence from investigations of vitamin c in other respiratory diseases to begin conducting clinical trials for severe hospitalized cases wwwclincialtrialsgov nct04264533 currently the recommended daily allowance rda of vitamin c for healthy adults according to the united states national institute of health nih dietary reference index dri is 7590 mgd tolerable upper intake level is 2 gd 192 due to a lack of evidence against covid-19 there are limited recommendations for vitamin c intake however previously doses of 12 gd were effective in preventing upper respiratory infections as those levels are not attainable through dietary sources supplementation may be advised for those at a higher risk of respiratory infections however as previously discussed doses above 200 mgday might not benefit healthy individualsthe data on vitamin d and immune function is also equivocal vitamin d is often referred to as the sunshine vitamin it is also found in eggs mushrooms fatty fish such as salmon milk and dairy products or foods fortified with vitamin d a recent analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials of 11000 patients showed an overall protective effect of vitamin d supplementation against acute respiratory tract infections 193 the research is not conclusive and some studies of vitamin d have not shown any benefit on balance vitamin d supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall patients who were very vitamin d-deficient and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefits recent research has suggested that increasing vitamin d intakes may reduce the risk of infections and also covid-19 33 the authors speculate that low vitamin d levels may play a role in the high incidences of covid-19 as the outbreak occurred in winter indeed several research groups have speculated the same and considered whether latitude plays a role in infection susceptibility 194 researchers have also highlighted the need for vulnerable groups to maintain their vitamin d status to reduce the risk of respiratory infections including covid-19 through various mechanisms 195196 moreover a trial is currently underway wwwclinicaltrialsgov nct04334005 with the aim of assessing the utility of vitamin d as an immune-modulating agent patients will be monitored to see if there is an improvement of health status in nonsevere symptomatic patients infected with covid-19 as well as determining if vitamin d could prevent patient deterioration vitamin d itself may exhibit antiviral effects by interfering with viral replication and through its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties 197 as a result it is assumed that increased vitamin d may provide benefits against sars-cov-2 infection 198 patients in switzerland that tested positive for sars-cov-2 had significantly lower 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels p  0004 median value 111 ngml compared with negative patients 246 ngml which was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age 70 years 199 however a recent analysis of the uk biobank provided no evidence to support a potential role for the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin d as an explanation for the increased susceptibility of individuals positive for covid-19 infection however they did discern that covid-19 disproportionately affected blacks and minority ethnic populations independent of vitamin d levels 78consequently further research is required before any determination can be made about the prophylactic or therapeutic values of vitamin d against covid-19 the rda of vitamin d for healthy adults according to the nih dri is 1520 gd 600800 iu tolerable upper intake level 100 gd or 4000 iu 200 however researchers recommend doses of 10000 iud 250 gd of vitamin d3 for several weeks to quickly raise 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations followed by 5000 iud 125 gd in order to maintain concentrations above 4060 ngml 100150 nmoll which may be beneficial against covid-19 higher doses of vitamin d are certainly advisable for vulnerable individuals it is also particularly important to increase dietary sources of vitamin d at this time as many globally are subjected to less sun exposure due to stay at home mitigation strategies although it is unclear whether the extreme doses suggested would be beneficial against covid-19 it is clear that they are unattainable through dietary means and would require supplementationvitamin e is a group of fat-soluble antioxidants that includes molecules such as tocopherols and tocotrienols however -tocopherol is the only form of vitamin e recognized to meet human requirements - and -tocopherols are both abundant forms of dietary vitamin e however -tocopherol is approximately 5 to 10-fold higher than -tocopherol in circulation due to the differences in bioavailability and metabolism 32 various foods provide vitamin e nuts seeds and vegetable oils are significant contributors to dietary intakes as well as green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals 32201 numerous animal and human studies reviewed by wu and meydani 202 have indicated that vitamin e deficiency impairs both humoral and cell-mediated immune functions it is generally accepted that vitamin e may exert its immunoenhancing effects by scavenging oxygen species to reduce oxidative stress 201 and it may induce anti-inflammatory effects 202 vitamin e can also protect the polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas in the cell membranes from oxidation regulate the production of ros and reactive nitrogen species rns and modulate signal transduction likewise vitamin e is present in high concentrations in immune cells which protects them from oxidative damage due to their high metabolic activity and pufa contents 32203 notably aging is associated with dysregulation of the immune system predisposing people to increased oxidative stress and inflammation this leads to increased incidences of infections in the elderly such as influenza despite the fact that the elderly have comparable vitamin e levels to younger individuals increasing vitamin e intakes may benefit their immune function impart resistance to infection and reduce morbidity due to infections 204205206 as the elderly are predisposed to infection due to immunosenescence 207 it is worth investigating vitamin e for potential benefits against covid-19 indeed it has been suggested that a combination of vitamins c and e may be a useful antioxidant therapy for cardia complications of covid-19 81 however there is little evidence to date on the utility of vitamin e as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against covid-19 the rda of vitamin e for healthy adults according to the nih dri is 15 mgd tolerable upper intake level 1000 mgd 192 while vitamin e has been recommended as a potentially beneficial nutrient against covid-19 infection 82 there are currently no estimates of a beneficial dosage zinc is a trace element of the diet that is critical to the development of immune cells and an important cofactor for many enzymes 208 zinc deficiency can contribute to defective cell-mediated immunity and to increased susceptibility to various infections including pneumonia 209210 despite various foods containing zinc including meat dairy and legumes etc 211212213 the majority of dietary zinc research has focused on zinc supplementation therefore it is not clear from dietary studies high in zinc if increased zinc intake can protect against the effects of viral infections indeed zinc supplements and lozenges are a popular remedy for fighting off colds and respiratory illnesses some studies have found that zinc lozenges may reduce the duration of a cold by about a day and may reduce the number of upper respiratory infections in children 214 the data on zinc are mixed and further research is necessary to support a supplementation policy it has certainly been suggested that increasing zinc intakes may be useful against covid-19 infections by reducing viral replication and reducing the effects of the gastrointestinal and lower respiratory symptoms 89 while the rda of zinc according to the nih dri is 811 mgd of zinc for adults tolerable upper intake level 40 mgd 215 it has been suggested that a zinc intake of 3050 mgd might aid in the control of rna viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses 115 copper is recognized as an essential trace element food groups such as offal and nuts and to a lesser extent cereals and fruits can be regarded as suitable dietary sources 216 copper is one of many dietary minerals including zinc that are essential to maintaining the integrity of dna by preventing oxidative dna damage 217 copper deficiency has been associated with altered immune responses and an increased frequency of infections 218 mechanistically copper deficiency can occur following chronic tnf--induced inflammation of the lungs and it is proposed that copper supplementation may ameliorate this lung inflammation in mice 219 however high levels of serum copper have been associated with adverse effects on respiratory health in humans 220 regardless of these inconsistencies bost et al and vixas et al 216221 have presented reviews relating to the adequacy of copper intake in developed countries they have found that adults and elderly populations generally meet dietary recommendations as a result a widespread adherence to healthy eating guidelines should achieve sufficiency the rda of copper according to the nih dri is 900 gd for adults tolerable upper intake level 10 mgd 215 while there has been no recommended dietary intake of copper against covid-19 a copper intake of 78 mgd has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and alter immune function albeit it is unknown whether those changes were beneficial 222 therefore considerably more research is required to determine whether higher intakes of dietary copper may benefit immune functions against viral infections studies demonstrate a lower incidence of bacterial translocation across the gut barrier with the administration of dietary fiber 223 suggesting that this nutrient modulates immunity among the potential mechanisms by which dietary fiber influences the immune system are changes to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues galt arising from altered gut microflora prebiotic fiber is neither hydrolyzed nor absorbed in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and becomes a selective substrate for one or a limited number of beneficial colonic bacteria 224225 indeed fiber intake has been shown to increase the survival of influenza-infected mice via various mechanisms including blunting the immune response by altering the type of immune cells generated and the generation of diet-derived short-chain fatty acid scfa-enhanced cd8 t cell effector functions by altering the cells metabolism 226 western diets are often deficient of dietary fiber 138 therefore increasing the consumption of both soluble oat bran barley nuts seeds beans lentils peas and some fruits and vegetables and insoluble wheat bran vegetables and whole grains sources of fiber to the recommended 2538 gday is advisable 227 currently there are no recommendations for fiber intake during the pandemic but higher intakes may not be advisable due to the potential risk for gastrointestinal issues while the mediterranean diet various food groups and nutrients are just some of the examples of how nutrition plays an important role in modulating our immune health and preventing the development of ncds most international nutritional guidelines follow similar patterns whereby they promote the high intake of fruits and vegetables and healthy quantities of the other food groups to provide all the essential nutrients for health hence following any healthy diet at this time that provides an adequacy of rnis will support immune function however there is concern that people who are deficient in some micronutrients such as vitamin c vitamin d or zinc may warrant supplementation or modify their dietary patterns to maintain a nutritional status and support healthy immune function this is particularly important for our vulnerable populations including the elderly and those with ncds indeed as many countries have imposed guidelines for people to stay in place and limit travel etc it is important for everyone to consider vitamin d levels when exposure to sunlight will be limited at this time 33196 likewise although not always possible depending on an individuals personal circumstances maintaining activity or moderate exercise at this time may be beneficial in supporting immune health 228 exercise in any form even within the home will help to maintain ones health as a lack of exercise could significantly affects a persons cardiovascular risk in the future 106 however exercise may not be advisable for symptomatic covid-19 patients not only to reduce the transmission of the virus but also because some covid-19 infections exhibit rare cardiac complications that could be aggravated by physical exertion 229 due to the stay in place guidelines it is also important to consider boredom and stress at this time as they are associated with increased food consumption which can lead to people inadvertently seeking comfort during times of stress like this current pandemic 126230231 sleep disturbances are also likely during isolation thus it is important to follow a normal sleep cycle if possible along with promoting following normal eating patterns to promote the synthesis of melatonin and serotonin at dinner 126 in particular the who provides sound and practical advice to all on how to manage your health in terms of nutrition and wellbeing during self-quarantine 232it has been observed that many patients presenting to hospitals with covid-19 infections have severe anorexia inflammation and markers of malnutrition these additional vulnerabilities may increase risks for respiratory failure necessitating noninvasive ventilation 83 furthermore prolonged hospitalization may be accompanied by decreases in weight and muscle mass which will further disadvantage at-risk patients 233234 therefore it is important to enhance nutrition to improve the response to therapy 235 two different italian research consortia have proposed nutritional interventions one to non-critically ill hospitalized covid-19 patients 83 and the other for those who are hospitalized severely ill and may require enteral nutrition 235 both aim to increase the likelihood of beneficial clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients certainly considering severe and nonsevere patient nutrition during hospitalization and interventions for those who recover from covid-19 infections is of considerable importance and requires further researcha final consideration to make is that there is a significant increase in pseudoscience and misinformation surrounding potential treatments and supplements to fight the covid-19 infection the authors would like to express again that there is currently no known effective treatment or mitigation strategy against covid-19 indeed it has been recognized by others that there is considerable emerging quackery in relation to various foods and nutraceuticals with purported benefits and immune-enhancing supplements that may prevent or even cure the covid-19 infection this is symptomatic of levels of desperation and anxiety surrounding the crisis 236 consequently it is important that pseudoscientific and false claims associated with nutritional products are avoided by manufacturers and reported to the relevant authorities to protect the health of those most vulnerable and susceptible within our communities the covid-19 pandemic is a significant threat to human life worldwide as there is no known effective cure or treatment for covid-19 yet all potential therapeutics mitigation interventions and prevention strategies that may reduce the incidence or severity of infection are of vital importance in this review inflammation associated with pre-existing comorbidities was highlighted as a significant risk factor for covid-19 patients as a result some of the anti-inflammatory therapies currently under investigation were discussed likewise the potential role of a persons nutritional status and nutrients and foods that may exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects were explored as summarized in figure 3 nutrients such as vitamin c vitamin d and zinc may hold some promise for the treatment of covid-19 likewise nutrients with anti-inflammatory antithrombotic and antioxidant properties may prevent or attenuate the inflammatory and vascular manifestations associated with covid-19 indeed following healthy dietary patterns and avoiding unhealthy dietary patterns such as the mediterranean and western diets respectively may have beneficial effects against infection but require significantly more research our primary conclusion is that it is vitally important to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle during the pandemic this is especially important for the vulnerable in our society in particular those at high risks of infection should at least maintain their nutritional status by ensuring they reach their rda of the potentially beneficial nutrients outlined in this review certainly governments should actively encourage healthy eating and exercise in conjunction with the guidance provided on personal hygiene and physical distancing that being said various socioeconomic issues lifestyle constraints access to food financial problems or stay in place mitigation guidelines may reduce ones ability to achieve this further research and review of the topics discussed in this manuscript are required as research evolves during the pandemic to discern the effective and ineffective strategies implemented globally coronaviruses the positive-sense enveloped rna virus with 2632 kb genome belong to the coronaviridae family of viruses capable of infecting both humans and other animals1 virus infection affects both the respiratory and digestive systems of the host human coronavirus hcov can be categorized into two depending on their pathogenic capability hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and hcov-hku are viruses that are included in low pathogenic hcov group that predominantly leads to infection in the upper respiratory tracts and results in common cold-like symptoms while severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the lately recognized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2sars-cov-2coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 are highly pathogenic hcovs 23 unlike low pathogenic hcov these highly pathogenic viruses have increased disease severity and death rate because of its ability to infect lower respiratory tract leading to clinical features like pneumonia acute lung injury ali and ards 4 also sars cov2 showed 790 genome identity to sarscov and 50 to mers cov 5 similar to mers and sars covs bats are considered as natural host of sars cov2 the virus is then transmitted via intermediate host to human the intermediate host for mers cov sars cov and sars cov2 were identified as dromedary camels civets and pangolins respectively 6viral entry into the host results in activation of innate immune mechanism together with the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators interaction of specific viral components with pattern recognition receptors of the host immune system activates cellular signalling pathways that culminate in the production of various cytokines these cytokines elicit host response like extravasation of leukocytes and activation proliferation and cell differentiation of adaptive and innate immune system 78 interleukin il-1 il-18 and il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf- interferon ifn- transforming growth factortgf- are the major cytokines while ccl-2monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 mcp-3 ccl-3macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 ccl-5 chemokine c-c motif ligand 5rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted and ifn--inducible protein-10 ip-10cxcl10 c-x-c motif chemokine 10 are the chemokines released during an influenza virus-induced infection 910 these cytokines exert host antiviral responses in different ways ifn- is a type 1 interferon that can inhibit viral replication thus inducing a potent antiviral state in the host 11 while tnf- triggers the immune cells localization at infection site and activation of caspases to promote apoptosis 12 il-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine which enhances inflammatory cell infiltration by increasing membrane permeability through activation of mast cells and subsequent release of histamine a vasodilator 13 il-6 mediates monocyte differentiation to macrophages and enhances mononuclear cell infiltration to the inflammation loci 14 moreover synergistically il-6 and tgf- induces maturation of naive helper t cells cd4 to t helper 17 th17 cells which are potential effectors against pathogens interestingly il-6 also hinders the treg expansion by tgf- 1516 enhancement of type 1 immunity activation of natural killer t cells nkt cells thus forming an early line of defence against viral infection are some of the biological actions of il-18 during viral infection 1718although these cytokines are released either as host protection or response against viral entry exacerbated cytokine release can adversely affect the host by overreacting to its own system organs named as cytokine storm and was observed in both sars and mers infection resulting in the associated severe complications and multiple organ failure 19 studies have established that similar hypercytokinemiacytokine storm is also taking part in sars-cov2covid-19 infection in this review we highlight the pathology and pathogenesis of mers cov sars cov and sars cov2 with main focus into the role of cytokines in pathology and its relation with co-morbidities of covid-19 infection 20according to who the middle east respiratory syndrome mers was observed in 2494 individuals and has a 344 case-fatality rate as of november 2019 r0 was estimated to be less than 1 indicating less transmissibility of virus 37 mers was reported in 27 countries globally the higher risk age group was 5059 years and mostly men were infected who 2019 httpapplicationsemrowhointdocsemrpub-csr-241-2019-enpdfua1ua1ua1 similar to sars-cov the early clinical indications of infection by mers-cov include cough dyspnea fever and myalgia which were then followed by the development of pneumonia in addition to symptoms associated with the respiratory system patients infected with mers-cov also experienced diarrhoea vomiting and abdominal pain interstitial infiltrates were observed in chest radiography of mers-cov infected individuals laboratory investigation showed increased concentration of ldh and aspartate aminotransferase ast low eosinophil and platelet count and decreased albumin level 38dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 or cd26 a cell surface protein is the functional receptor for mers-cov to enter host cells compared to other coronavirus mers-cov exhibits a wide range of in vitro tissue tropism because of the wide expression of dpp4 in different tissues like epithelial cells in the kidney small intestine alveoli prostate liver and activated t lymphocytes 39 in lungs dpp4 is expressed in multinucleated epithelial cells submucosal gland cells and bronchial pneumocytes but not in upper airway epithelium 40 additionally mers-cov can infect monocyte-derived-dendritic cells and macrophages when compared with sars-cov28 ultra-structural finding of mers infected patients showed the presence of viral particles in pneumocytes pulmonary and skeletal muscles macrophages and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells 41 furthermore up-regulation of smad7 and fgf2 fibroblast growth factor 2 expressions in kidney and lung by merscov resulted in cell death and tissue damage 42 infection of t cells of peripheral blood spleen and tonsils with mers cov resulted in activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways leading to cell death bear out the observation of lymphopenia in mers infection 43 moreover patients with co-morbidities like diabetes cardiovascular diseases end-stage renal disease and hypertension were more prone to fatal conditions 44blood cytokine analysis performed in severely infected mers individuals demonstrated a marked increase in concentration of il-6 il-10 il-15 ip-10 il-17 tnf and ifn- 2 in comparison to controls 4445 additionally significantly increased mrna expression of il-8 il-12 ifn- rantes ip-10 mcp-1 and mip-1 were seen in human macrophages infected by mers-cov 46 suggesting that these cytokines are implicated in the infiltration of immune cell in lungs leading to hyper inflammation and finally progress to lung injurythe first documented case of covid19 was in december 2019 from the wuhan city of china httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncovpdfsfvrsn20a99c104 and as of 22 june 2020 8860331 individuals were reported as sars-cov-2 positive resulting in the death of 465740 patients and have already affected 216 countries and regional territories globally thus sars-cov-2 pandemic fit in to the very high-risk category and has crossed statistics of the earlier epidemics caused by sar-cov and mers-cov httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200622-covid-19-sitrep-154pdfsfvrsnd0249d8d2 according to who estimated r0 was 2- 25 which is less than that of sars however later a review reported r0 as 328 signifying high transmission capability of virus 47initially majority of patients were presented with clinical indications like dry cough myalgia fever fatigue dyspnoea headache vomiting and diarrhoea at later stages severely infected patients showed clinical manifestations including pharyngeal pain dizziness abdominal pain and anorexia laboratory analysis of the patient samples revealed leucopenia lymphopenia high pro-thrombin time high levels of hepatic enzymes like ast ldh increased bio-markers of inflammation like erythrocyte sedimentation rate serum c-reactive protein and ferritin elderly people and those patients with underlying diseases like copd hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes belong to the high-risk group in which the disease might advance to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with sars cov2 infection showed ground-glass opacity and segmental consolidation of both lungs as patchy areas in computer-assisted tomography scan of the chest and was suffering from pneumonia other major complications of sars-cov2 infection include shock arrhythmia acute cardiac injury and secondary infection which finally need assistance by mechanical ventilation 4849like sars cov ace2 is the primary cell entry receptor for sars cov2 into its host upon priming of spike protein of virus by cellular protease like tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 viral fusion with the cell membrane is triggered 24 on protein structural analysis receptor binding domain rbd of s protein of sars cov2 and sars cov showed 72 amino acid sequence identity indicating the higher affinity of sars cov2 to its receptor in comparison to sars cov50 furthermore furin-like cleavage site of sars cov2 spike protein also help in its priming making the virus more contagious interestingly this furin-like cleavage site was observed in human coronavirus oc43 and mers but not in sars cov 51 infection with cytopathic virus like sars-cov-2 results in inflammasome formation and pyroptosis mediated by caspase1 activation and associated inflammatory response 52covid-19 infected patients showed higher concentration of peripheral blood immune mediators including mig il-6 ccl8 mcp-2 il-9 il-1 mip2-a cxcl2 tnf- cxcl16 il-2 il-1rainterleukin-1 receptor antagonist il-7 mip1- ip-10 il-8 basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf mcp-1

il-2 il-6 il-7 ip-10 il-2r il-10 tnf- mip-1 mcp-1 and gscf levels positively correlated with disease severity suggesting that hypercytokinemia can aggravate immunopathology and inflammation 4853 54 55only a few in vitro studies have been published so far on covid-19 and cytokine deregulation based on available medical and in vitro data it can be observed that there is a significant distinguishable pattern in the cytokine storm of covid-19 with sars-cov and mers-cov infection fig 1
 only three cytokines viz il-6 ip-10 and ifn- showed markedly elevated levels in all three highly pathogenic hcov infections in sars patients the level of ip -10 correlated with disease severity 31 it has been also shown that ip-10 induction in lungs leads to immune cell infiltration and apoptosis causing acute lung injury in sars 30 moreover increased levels of ip-10 were also associated with disease progression in mers-cov patients and continual high level as a sign of poor outcome 44 increased expression of mig and ip-10 chemo attractants that enlist activated t cells by chemokine receptor cxcr3 signalling was observed in inflammation specifically in activated bronchial epithelium 56 sars cov infection mice model showed up-regulation of ip-10 mig and its receptor in the lungs implicating the relevance of cxcr3 cascade to the development of ards in sars cov 57 enhanced cxcr3 signalling was previously reported with aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis 58 recent study on covid-19 reported that elevated levels of nasopharyngeal ip-10 can be used as a new biomarker for undiagnosed covid-19 case 59 this indicates the importance of ip-10 and its signalling in the progression to pneumonia and ultimately the fatality of covid-19 patients recent ex vivo experiment conducted in human lung tissue to address the viral features like high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection of sars-cov2 by inoculating sars-cov-2 or sars cov showed an increased capacity of sars-cov2 in infecting and replicating in human lung tissues more vigorously than sars-cov suggesting the existence of increased viral load in airway secretions seen in covid-19 patients even in the incubation period however sars-cov2 did not induce significant ifns type i ii iii and pro-inflammatory mediators except ip-10 in the human lung tissues ex vivo human lung tissue is not a perfect representative for host immune response this data of decreased inflammatory mediators contradict with existing reports of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines even in moderately ill covid-19 patients 60 in another study peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc and balf transcriptome sequencing of sars-cov-2 infected patient revealed enrichment of mcp-1 ip-10 mip-1a and mip1b genes of note sars-cov-2 also induced apoptosis and p53 signalling pathways implicating the laboratory finding of lymphopenia in covid-19 patients 61another major cytokine that mediate organ damage in cytokine storm is il-6 excessive secretion of il-6 results in activation of coagulation pathway conversion of naive t cells increase in vascular permeability and reduced cardiac function contribute to the increased disease severity 6263 sars patients also showed increased levels of il-6 which correlated with disease progression 30 increased levels of th17 cd4 t cells seen in covid-19 patients can be explained by high levels of il-6 which is implicated in t helper 17 th17 cells development 1664 interestingly spike protein of sars cov induced activation of nf-b signalling resulting in il-6 and tnf- secretion in murine macrophages 65 later in another study reported that inhibiting nf-b signalling was demonstrated with decreased il-6 levels and increased animal survival in sars 66 these studies implicate il-6 to be a key contributor to the patho-physiology of the cytokine-storm seen in both the sars cov infections one of the proposed mechanisms for decreased t cells in covid-19 infection could be mediated by increased levels of il-6 and increased interaction between fas and its ligand moreover an increased number of lymphocytes were observed in patients sars cov2 infection when treated with tocilizumab the il-6 receptor antagonist 6768 yet more studies are required for speculating the exact mechanism of sars cov2 induced lymphopenia and other immunological featuresas depicted in fig 1 altered mcp-1 il-2 mig and il-8 levels were observed in both sars cov and sars cov2 infected patients thus cytokine storm in sars-cov2 infection has been linked with both th1 which is mediated by ifn- ip-10 il-1  mcp-1 il-2 and th2 response mediated by il-10 48 which is different from that of sars-cov in which no change occurs in th2 cytokines 33 compared to sars cov more number of cytokines and chemokines are involved in the immune pathology of covid-19 common cytokine increased among sars cov2 and mers was il-10 ip-10 il-6 and tnf- speculating that sars cov2 show less similarity with mers cov even in eliciting an immune response when compared to sars cov these differences in cytokine release pattern by each pathogenic hcovs imply about the uniqueness in eliciting immune response and pathogenesis based on these observations it is reasonable to suggest that an increased response of th1 cytokines th2 cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines contribute to the immune pathology of covid-19 infection in contrast to sars which was predominantly mediated by ifn- induced th1 response 69 another study also demonstrated that covid-19 patients were presented with defective interferon activation and enhanced nfb mediated tnf- and il-6 production 70 moreover sars cov2 infection was also associated with defective ifn1 expression like sars cov this was confirmed by blancomelo et al on their experiments in ferret model infected cell line primary bronchial cells and serum cytokine profiling the authors have shown delayed ifn type1 and 111 expression along with increased levels of chemokines 55 single-cell sequencing scrna-seq of covid-19 patients showed impaired immune response by activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways in lung samples 71 these findings speculate that the combined action of exaggerated cytokine levels and defective antiviral innate immune response by interferons results in deterioration of sars cov2 infection interferon therapy for covid-19 patients has already been suggested 72 and findings of a clinical trial with interferon-2b have shown promising results 73 further studies will have to be performed to reveal the actual immune mechanism behind the pathogenesis and cytokine storm-induced hyper-inflammation during the disease comparative analysis of sars cov mers cov and sars cov2 is summarised in table 1
although the occurrence of copd in covid-19 patients was reported as 32 74 the rate of disease severity and the mortality rate was markedly high with 60 and 63 respectively 75increasing the adverse effect of covid-19 by 59 fold 76 this data have to be stratified based on the cause and difference stages of copd interestingly current smokers tend to develop morecovid-19 associated complications compared to non-smokers and the collective frequency of smokers with covid-19 is 9 75 chronic exposure to environmental pollution smoking and other irritants eventually end up in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd main characteristic features of copd include inflammation of lung parenchyma obstruction in airflow pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis 77 damage of epithelial cells results in the excessive infiltration of monocytesneutrophils and cytotoxic t lymphocytes cd8 t-cell to peripheral airways and lung parenchyma and consequent release of inflammatory mediators like chemokines cytokines and other proteases 78 spill over of these inflammatory mediators from airway inflammation to systemic circulation further results in systemic inflammation and associated manifestations a complex network of cytokines has been implicated in the inflammatory process of copd prominent cytokines elevated in both plasma and sputum samples of copd patients were il-18 vegf il-6 il-1 tnf- and il8 79 80 81 82molecular mechanisms of disease were discovered using the protein-protein interaction ppi network analysis ppi interaction studies conducted by kumar spotted out cxcr4 tnf ccl5 ccl2 ifn- cxcl8 il-6 il-10 icam1 cxcl1 as the major genes involved in the copd high-risk group of covid-19 indicating the importance of cytokine signalling as one of the pathogenesis in copd patients with covid-19 83 additionally ace2 the entry point of sars cov2 expression was upregulated in lower airways epithelium of smokers and copd patients suggesting the increased entry of virus making them more vulnerable for the virus 84 thus underlying deregulated immune system with increased levels of cytokines and subsequent inflammation in copd superimpose sars cov2 induced hypercytokinemia further aggravating the fatality in the copd risk group of covid-19 patientsa pooled analysis conducted by lippi g et al identified increased fatal conditions in covid-19 infected hypertensive patients by 25 fold 85 the development and progression of hypertension are under inherent and acquired immune surveillance triggers like angiotensin ii excessive salt diet etc could induce activation and permeation of various immune cells in kidneys heart and blood vessels the inflammatory mediators released by these cells culminate in vascular injury and inflammation 86 several studies have identified the profound role of il-1 il-6 il-8 il-17 il-18 il-23 ifn- tnf- and tgf- in the inflammatory pathogenesis of hypertension 87 an increased concentration of il-2 ifn- il-8 il-1 mcp-1 vegf epidermal growth factor and tnf- was observed in the serum of hypertensive patients 88 additionally il-4 and il-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were notably lower in hypertensive patients in comparison to control subjects suggesting a skewed th1 th2 and th17 immune response stemming in the inflammatory pathogenesis of hypertension 8889 as discussed earlier covid-19 patients were shown to have high levels of il-1 mcp-1 il-6 il-2 tnf- and il-8 as these cytokines were also found to be increased in hypertension their role in deterioration of covid19 infection is suggestivemoreover the role of the ras in pathology of hypertension is well described and type 1 at1 angiotensin ii ang ii receptor blockers arbs and angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors are given for hypertensive patients as most important therapeutic medicines 90 in addition to the increased ace2 expression decreased viral clearance also contributes to the intensified pathological scenario in covid-19 infections 91 computational network analysis picked cxcl8 vegfa ccl2 il-10 il-6 mmp-9 tnf as key genes in hypertension high-risk covid-19 patients 83 accordingly we can put forward that low-grade chronic inflammation seen in hypertensive patients ease the cytokine storm culminating in ards and death in covid-19the death rate of covid-19 patients with cvd was 105 92 the deregulated immune system is one of the putative links between cvd and covid-19 high blood pressure hyperlipidemia insulin resistance and other factors activate complex inflammatory cascade leading to atherosclerosis chronic endothelial injury results in endothelial dysfunction with augmented vascular permeability followed by extravasation of t lymphocytes monocytes and mononuclear leukocytes this finally leads to macrophage activation foam cells formation and plaque development 9394 cytokines like il-1 il-6 pdgf il-8 ifn- tnf- and mcp-1 released from smooth muscle cells epithelial cells and immune cells of atherosclerotic plaque regulates its stability by modulating smooth muscle cell activity and apoptosis 9596 moreover the systemic concentrations of il-6 and il-18 are considered as a predictor of increased mortality in cvd patients 9798 cytokine network of high levels of il-18 il-1 tnf- il-8 ifn- il-6 pdgf and mcp-1 modulate inflammatory angiogenesis in cardiovascular disease 95high level of ace2 expression seen in lungs and heart suggests defective ace2- signalling pathways causing cardiac injury in covid-19 although the risk of ace inhibitors for cvd treatment in covid-19 is still on debate other possible mechanisms in relation with covid-19 and heart injury comprise excessive inflammatory response mediated by cytokine storm hypoxia caused by apoptosis of myocardial cells and respiratory failure 99 moreover top genes in cvd risk of covid-19 infection identified by network analysis of protein-protein interaction as follows tnf il-6 ccl2 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcr4 and icam1 83 thus hyperinflammation in cvd because of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines add up the negative effects of cytokine storm induced by sars cov2altered glucose homeostasis and immune imbalance could attribute to the increased susceptibility of diabetic patients for pathogens 100 ssars cov2 infected patients with diabetes had a 2 times increased risk of disease worsening and mortality compared to those with no diabetes 101 activated innate immune system and increased pro-inflammatory markers are linked with the pathogenesis of type2 diabetes t2dm and its microvascular complications like retinopathy nephropathy etc 102 these inflammatory mediators contribute to the augmentation of altered glucose metabolism insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity enhanced liver acute phase proteins synthesis and secretion and other inflammatory markers 103 tnf- mcp-1 il-6 and il-1 are prevalent cytokines that participate in the immune pathologic process of type 2 diabetes 104 additionally levels of il-4 tnf- il-7 gmcsf il-15 ifn-  il-1 tnf- il-12p70 mip-1 il-17a il-6 ip-10 il-10 mip-1 mcp-1 il-8 il-13 and il-9 and were increased in type 2 diabetic patients 105106an immune-mediated inflammatory cascade is a crucial event in type1 diabetes which involves the activation and infiltration of t lymphocytes macrophages and various other immune cells and production of inflammatory mediators in the pancreas 107 increased levels of il-1 tnf- il-23 il-1 il-10 il-17a and il-6 were seen in type1 diabetic patients 108 109 110 study conducted in non-obese diabetic mice model showed ifn- can inhibit il-10 induction thereby altering t cell regulation 111hence the basic levels of il-18 mcp-1 il-1 tnf- mip-1 ip-10 il-6 il-8 and mip-1 were high in diabetic patients with covid-19 and sars cov2 infection was associated with increased level of above mentioned cytokines the exuberant cytokines can be one of the cause of the severity and worsening in state of covid19 patients with diabetes patients suffering from type 1 or type 2 diabetes are given treatment of arbs and ace inhibitors this leads to increased ace2 expression in diabetic patients aiding sars cov2 infection in them 90 tnf cxcl8 il-10 ccl2 icam1 ifn- il-2 cxcr4 were the key genes identified by ppi network analysis for the covid-19 diabetic high-risk group 83 as described earlier diabetes is associated with hyperglycemia increased coagulation state altered immune system intense inflammatory response with heightened release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 112 facilitates sars cov2 induced cytokine storm that contribute to the disease severity of covid19 patientstill now only one report shows gestational diabetes mellitus gdm as a comorbidity in two pregnant women who died because of covid-19 infection 113 role of inflammation and insulin resistance in gdm has been well described gdm is associated with altered cytokine concentrations that further enhance maternal insulin resistance high risk of pregnancy outcome and neonatal complications 114 pro-inflammatory cytokine like il-6 tnf- il-8 and il-18 were elevated in gdm patients along with low levels of il-10 115on the basis of the above mentioned data one can envisage that elevated concentrations of these pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in covid-19 patient with underlying risk factors furthermore intensifies the cytokine storm associated inflammation induced by sars cov2 thereby converting the cytokine-storm of covid-19 to a cytokine super cyclone fig 2
 importantly co-morbidities associated with covid-19 and sars cov2 infection have a shared cytokine profile indicating importance of anti-cytokine therapy however future projects are warranted to unveil the pathophysiological mechanisms of association between risk factors like copd hypertension cvd diabetes and covid-19 and disease managementvaccines are given to raise immune protection against specific pathogens by inducing immunological memory bacillus calmette- gurin bcg the vaccine given for protection against mycobacteria infections is administered in new-born based on several clinical trials and observational studies it has been shown that bcg vaccination could reduce the neonatal as well as childhood death rate 116117 retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in sub-saharan african children of below 5 years demonstrated a positive association of bcg vaccination and lower threat of malaria 118 additionally epidemiological studies have also established the protective role of bcg against respiratory tract infections in children which are predominantly virus-mediated 119120 vaccination with bcg enhanced ifn- and il-10 level thus providing immunity against respiratory tract infection even in elderly age group 121 this is because bcg also provides some non-specific immune assistance like immunity against pathogens other than mycobacteria like virus and parasites and reduces the occurrence of allergy this is attained through a mechanism termed as trained immunity which is the immunological recall of the innate immune system via epigenetic reprogramming 122 innate immune cells like monocytes nk cells and macrophages undergo epigenetic modifications of histones that include methylation and acetylation enhances gene expression of il-6 tnf- and il-1 upon bcg vaccination thus the trained phenotype of innate immune cells results an increase in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines on exposure to non-specific pathogen enhancing host protection 123124 it has been experimentally shown that healthy subjects immunized with bcg show increased production of tnf- and il-1 in response to bacterial and non-bacterial stimulants increased h3k4me3 trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 4 exposed promoter regions of these pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to their increased expression 125 in another study bcg vaccination reduced viremia in experimental human yellow fever virus infection model by inducing trained immunity by epigenetic modification of monocytes resulting in increased production of il-1 126 moreover bcg could enhance heterologous th1th17 responses by inducing the long-lasting release of il-22 ifn- and il-17 thereby attaining non-specific immune response to infections 127 in line with this several in vivo studies in murine models were also reported bcg immunized mice expressed antimicrobial peptides and bestowed protection against malarial parasitemia 128 additionally prior bcg vaccination in influenza virus challenged mice were found to have considerable protection via secretion of antibody or activation of cell-mediated immunity 129 a study conducted in mice model to understand the effect of bcg against various viral infections like herpes simplex type 1 influenza a2 and encephalomyocarditis viruses showed increased resistance of bcg immunised mice against these viruses compared to control mice 130 specifically bcg vaccinated newborn mice were shown to be more resistant against herpes simplex type 2 infection 131 based on these observations it has been proposed that bcg vaccine has the potential to act as a protective agent against sars cov2 as it provides antiviral immunity 132 sars-cov2 virus enhances the generation of il-6 ifn- tnf- and il-1 in mild to severely infected patients 48 as discussed earlier the trained immunity of bcg vaccine involves the release of these cytokines thus providing an antiviral state and earlier protection against sars-cov2 fig 3
 ozdemir et al has already documented a marked decrease in the number of cases per population death per population and deaths per cases ratio of covid-19 in bcg vaccinated countries than bcg-non-vaccinated countries 133 another observational study conducted in 25 level 4 european countries found a positive correlation of bcg vaccination and decreased death rate in covid 19 but could not found any association with pneumococcal vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccination even after adjusting with several covariates like days from day 1 to lockdown life-expectancy the net migration median age case-fatality rate the proportion of the population living in an urban setting population size population density and elderly dependency ratio 134 moreover bcg vaccination protocols and bacteria strains used are different among bcg vaccinated countries 135 epidemiological analysis of bcg vaccination on covid 19 based on these data-set has to be done in future for better understanding furthermore it is also significant to study the impact of covid-19 infection in patients with co-morbidities like diabetes hypertension copd and cardiovascular disease in bcg vaccinated and non-vaccinated countries although multiple studies support the hypothesis of the generic defensive role of bcg vaccine against the covid 19 pandemic 136137 controversies have been reported on the same aspect 138139 as each study has used different data extraction indicators statistical analysis and correction with confounding variables they cannot give ultimate evidence of causality and underscore the importance of clinical trials to conclude upon the association of bcg with covid-19 infectionas of now a total of 16 clinical trials were registered in clinicaltrialsgov run by the united states national library of medicine to delineate bcg induced trained immunity protection against sars cov2 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultscondcovidtermbcgcntrystatecitydist out of 16 only 8 studies started recruitment of participants among these bcg-corona reducing health care workers absenteeism in covid-19 pandemic by enhanced trained immune responses through bacillus calmette-gurin vaccination a randomized controlled trial brace bcg vaccination to reduce the impact of covid-19 in healthcare workers following coronavirus exposure bcg vaccine for health care workers as defense against covid 19 badas and bcg vaccination for healthcare workers in covid-19 pandemic are conducting their trials in healthcare workers as they are more vulnerable to covid 19 infection the primary objective of brace badas and bcg vaccination for healthcare workers in covid-19 pandemic is to analyse the occurrence and severity of covid-19 in bcg vaccinated and non vaccinated groups while bcg-corona trial is estimated to involve 1500 health workers and aims to assess whether unplanned absenteeism of these participants can be reduced by bcg vaccination in the covid-19 pandemic since existing reports regarding the protective role of bcg and covid-19 were based on observational data analysis the results of these trials are crucial to getting a definite conclusion who has not yet advised bcg immunization against sars-cov2 infection httpswwwwhointnews-roomcommentariesdetailbacille-calmette-guc3a9rin-bcg-vaccination-and-covid-19 in addition to clinical trials more epidemiological studies are required to strategize the status of co- morbidities and associated death in bcg vaccinated covid-19 cases these data are important to envisage the safeguarding nature of bcg vaccine against covid-19 as high-risk patients are more prone to the lethal effect of sars cov2virus infection leads to activation of multiple immune pathways finally culminating in virus removal from the host in rare cases the immune system gets over-activated triggering a cascade of events that is ultimately fatal for the patient uncontrolled secretion of cytokines of the innate immune system is associated with hyper inflammation and ards in covid 19 patients and is well established another important finding is that levels of cytokines correlate with disease severity interestingly increasing cytokine levels due to over-stimulated immune response upon covid-19 infection results in synergistic action of covid-19 induced cytokine-storm and cytokine-upheaval in high-risk patients with co-morbidities leading to extensively severe clinical manifestations culminating in high mortality associated with this disease while on the other hand trained immunity of bcg vaccine involves the secretion of il-1 tnf- and il-6 thus providing an antiviral state and early protection against sars-cov2dr malini laloraya is supported by department of biotechnology dbt-rajiv gandhi centre for biotechnology bsj supported by research fellowship from department of science  technology dst inspire fellowship20151f150361

a represented by cluster 4 and consisting of mostly genes driving the toll-like receptor tlr and inflammatory response as well as cytokine signaling pathways figure s1 was notably higher than in healthy controls table s1 expression of most of these genes peaked on day 6 of illness this peak in pro-inflammatory gene expression thus lagged behind the nadir of respiratory function on day 5 of illness figures 1c and 1d indeed cytokines such as il2 il6 tnf and ifna113 were either expressed within the range of healthy controls or were induced only after respiratory function nadir figure s1f only expression of the cytokines il1a and il1b preceded the nadir of respiratory function figure 2b correspondingly expression of il1 receptor figure 2b and the associated downstream signaling molecules figure s1e was also induced before respiratory function nadir these findings albeit from a single subject raise the possibility that global cytokine expression is not the cause of compromised respiratory function in covid-19 patients instead the finding of increased expression of il1 and its associated signaling pathway suggests that covid-19 pathogenesis may be driven by this pathway if this is proven correct licensed il1 or il1 receptor antagonistssuch as canakinumab and anakinra respectivelycould potentially be repurposed to treat covid-19 patients to prevent respiratory dysfunctionanother remarkable difference between case 1 and cases 2 and 3 as well as healthy controls were genes in cluster 3 figure 2a in this cluster mrna of genes in the mhc class iisuch as hla-drb1 hla-dma and hla-dmband t cell activation pathwayssuch as il23a and cd74were reduced in abundance in case 1 compared to others figure s1 accordingly the cd4 cd8a and cd8b mrna transcript levels were the lowest among all the subjects figure 2c curiously the expression of genes in these same pathways in cases 2 and 3 were comparable with healthy controls table s1 these findings raise two possible explanations first case 1 has reduced activation of adaptive immune genes which unleashed the tlr-mediated pro-inflammatory response indeed an experimental study has found that reduced t cell activation potentiates tlr-mediated inflammation in a positive feedback loop kim et al 2007 second and alternatively increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in case 1 could have led to recruitment of cd4 and cd8 t cells from the peripheral blood to sites of infection and the draining lymph nodes that could have led to the mostly negative rt-pcr finding in the throat swabs from case 1 in contrast the lower pro-inflammatory responses in cases 2 and 3 could have not only elicited mild symptoms but also led to a more attenuated t cell activation remarkably case 2 was afebrile throughout the period of isolation and his cough resolved 10 days before sars-cov-2 rt-pcr became negative however with an attenuated t cell response sars cov-2 became prolonged as shown by the consistent viral rt-pcr positivity that lasted for nearly a month in either case our data suggests an important role for t cells in covid-19 defining the role of t cells in either the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 or prolonged sars cov-2 infection should thus be a priority as the understanding of this would impact case management and virus transmission control respectivelywe also did not observe any appreciable impact on pro-inflammatory gene expression t cell responses or viral clearance with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment indeed pro-inflammatory gene expression continued to rise after treatment initiation and sars-cov-2 rt-pcr was positive again 2 days after the start of treatmentfinally we believe that our data serve as a guide to design future investigations indeed because of the prolonged course of illness we quickly reached the ethical limit of blood volume that could be collected we focused on measuring rna as we were able to isolate total rna from whole blood collected directly into a denaturing guanidine-based lysis buffer that would inactivate any viremia moreover the use of additional methods such as flow cytometry and elispot assay would not be pragmatic for this initial characterization of the immune response these methods require larger blood volumes and manipulation in a suitably equipped biosafety level 3 containment laboratory notwithstanding the small sample size we believe our findings can serve to guide design of more detailed studies especially in the choice of sampling time points to understand the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infectionin conclusion the acute immune response to sars cov-2 infection is dynamic and this dynamism needs to be taken into consideration in covid-19 pathogenesis studies

spherical positive sense rna coronavirus cov were known causative agents of mild respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases until the sars outbreak of 2002 it was then discovered that this virus has great potential for causing highly lethal epidemic outbreaks as witnessed during severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov eruptions the latest addition to pathogenicity of coronaviruses is the current pandemic of sars-cov2 responsible for covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 14 as on 31st may 2020 the disease has already infected 62 million cases worldwide with a record case fatality of 372 lakhs india with a total of 186 lakh cases and 5200 deaths is standing at 8th position amongst 215 countries affected globally 5 6 the increasing hospitalization and mortality linked to covid-19 are seen to be associated with a number of underlying conditions such as obesity hypertension diabetes advancing age history of cardiovascular and chronic lung diseases 710obesity is a chronic disease with complex pathophysiology that is characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipose tissue resulting in an imbalanced energy state obesity is a fast growing non-communicable pandemic with a global prevalence of 39 according to 2016 who global health observatory data it can be seen more predominantly in developed nations such as european countries and united states in comparison to south east asian countries with a prevalence of 587 and 625 vs 219 respectively 11 adipocytes and non-adipocytic immune cells together constitute adipose tissue besides being a storage site adipose tissue is also responsible for secretion of various hormones leptin adiponectin etc and cytokines such as interleukin-6 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- adipocyte is no longer considered to be an inert cell but they are considered as an active endocrine organ 12 increased production of these substances establishes a state of chronic low-grade inflammation which in turn results in various metabolic disturbancesthe metabolic disorders most significantly related to obesity are insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertriglyceridemia atherosclerosis hypertension and cardiovascular diseases many forms of cancer and various other inflammation related diseases 1316 all these disorders frequently related to obesity are also found to be associated with patients at increased risk of developing covid-19 infection moreover a strong correlation of obesity with influenza and other respiratory viral infections has already been established earlier 17 18 these factors suggest the importance of studying the role of obesity in present sars cov2 infection and its role in disease progressionobesity is either directly or indirectly linked to most of the high risk factors for covid-19 as determined by center for disease control and prevention 10 individuals with diabetes mellitus hypertension and severe obesity basal metabolic index bmi  40 kgm2 are more likely to be infected and are at a higher risk for complications and death from covid-19 19 these chronic low-grade inflammatory conditions characterized by increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines predisposes individuals to increased risk for infection and adverse outcomes 20the link of obesity to various comorbidities safely establishes its role as an exponentially important factor in determining the morbidity and mortality risk in sars cov2 patients a case study on 5700 patients with covid-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in new york city between march 1 2020 and april 4 2020 showed that 417 patients suffered from obesity thus being one of the most common comorbidities along with diabetes 338 21 similar results were observed by lille university center france which showed that requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation imv was significantly higher in severe obesity bmi  35 compared with lean patients 818 vs 419 22 it has been observed that young people with severe obesity may evolve towards destructive alveolitis with respiratory failure and death 23 a french study in 124 sars cov2 patients also corroborated the fact that severely obese patients were more predisposed to receive imv and the proportion of patients who require imv increased with bmi 24data from the uk intensive care national audit and research centre wuhan and bronx new york the hotbeds of covid-19 established that 72 88 and 35 of those admitted in intensive care units respectively who developed fatal covid19 related complications were either overweight or obese 25 thus establishing that obesity and covid-19 have a fatal association which is all pervasive beyond ethnicity and geographical boundaries on studying clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients suffering from cardiovascular disease it was found that bmi of patients in the critical group was much higher when compared to non-critical patients on further subdivision of critical patients it was found that non-survivors had significantly higher bmi when compared to survivors 8824 vs 1895 26obesity not only causes fatal outcomes in covid-19 but also there is increasing evidence that suggests that it is responsible for a more severe form of the disease italian national institute of health launched a surveillance system to collect information on all covid19 cases throughout the country which revealed that 99 of all deaths occurred in patients with history of preexisting noncommunicable diseases 27 28 data from a hospital in shenzhen elucidated that those who were overweight had 184-fold odds of developing severe covid-19 while those who were obese were at 340-fold odds of developing the severe form of the disease 29 this buttressed the fact that the relationship between obesity and severity of covid-19 was a continuum more the bmi worse would be the disease severityin developing south east asian countries prevalence of obesity is 219 as established from who data a study from brazil analyzed its general adult population assessing the risk factors associated with covid-19 infection in a large household-based survey covering 51770 individuals it was found that 22 of the population irrespective of any age group was obese and were prone to developing the infection 11 30 extensive data search has yielded that despite having a considerable prevalence of obesity most of the developing countries including india have not yet focused on efforts to correlate covid-19 severity with bmiobesity as a risk factor is more prevalent in the united states and other developed countries probably due to increased consumption of the typical western diet consisting of high amounts of carbohydrates sugars and saturated fat with low levels of fiber unsaturated essential fats and antioxidants this type of a diet leads to activation of the innate immune system and inhibition of the adaptive immune system inhibition of t and b lymphocyte function potentially via an increase in oxidative stress 31strategies to treat sars cov-2 virus infection with ace 2 inhibitors are being evaluated it has been theorized that since sars cov2 gains entry through ace 2 receptors hence blocking of ace 2 will help in spreading the infection to the lung since convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies decreases the severity of the infection one approach surmised was to saturate the sars cov 2 s protein with recombinant ace 2 42 43 ace2 is already available as an experimental drug for the treatment of ards 41 it has shown improvement in ards in mice and pigs unfortunately humans have not shown any effect on mitigation of lung injury in ards by ace 2 41 4446 in a japanese study tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate was used to decrease pancreatic inflammation the patient showed decrease in viral infection 47 this anti tmprss2 approach could be developed as a strategy to decrease viral infectionace and atr1 receptor blockade leads to ace 2 upregulation blockade of ace 2 and atr1 could lead to decreased proinflammatory pathway and enhanced ace 2 would tilt the balance towards ang 17 through mas receptors 48 however upregulation of ace 2 might increase the severity of infection clearly then ace blocking is a double-edged sword in the absence of clear-cut data as to the potential risks and benefits of ace blockade aha has issued instructions to all patients on ace inhibitors to continue their treatment 49subclinical chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is responsible for underlying pathological condition of obesity and its complications adipose tissue not only contains adipocytes but also other cells like fibroblasts preadipocytes macrophages and vascular components macrophages are as such important contributors to inflammation and it has also been documented that adipocytes also contribute to significant intrinsic inflammatory properties adipocytes express many receptors that are sensitized by infectious disease agents just like macrophages on stimulation of these receptors cytokine-mediated inflammatory signal transduction cascades are activated and a number of potent inflammatory cytokines and acute phase reactants are secreted 50c-reactive protein crp is named so because it has the capacity of precipitating somatic c-polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae human crp is a pentameric calcium dependant ligand binding plasma protein weighing 115 kda and consists of five identical polypeptide subunits crp is an acute phase reactant that binds to a variety of autologous and extrinsic ligands the pentameric form dissociates into a physiologically active and pro-inflammatory monomeric form which further binds to cell surface receptors and thus is implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases 5153 high baseline crp in overweight individuals has been observed in number of studies that establishes the chronic low-grade inflammatory state in obese individuals 5458in a large multicentric study in south korea the association between hs-crp high sensitivity-crp and sarcopenic obesity was studied after all the demographic variables were adjusted it was found that hs-crp was significantly elevated in obese individuals when compared to normal control group these findings can be corroborated further with support of many studies where baseline crp is found to be elevated in obese individuals 57interleukin-6 il-6 is a cytokine that has distinct biological activities it is a hepatic acute phase reactant that helps in regulation of b cell stimulation and in maintaining the balance between regulatory and effector t cells apart from involvement in inflammatory and infective responses it also plays a role in the regulation of metabolic regenerative and many neural processes it acts via two signaling pathwaysclassic signaling pathway responsible for mediating anti-inflammatory properties of il-6 whereas pro-inflammatory activities are mediated by trans-signaling pathway biological functioning of il-6 is mediated by the receptor complex consisting of interleukin-6 receptor il-6ran il-6 binding type i glycosylated transmembrane protein and gp130a type i signal transducer protein unlike il-6r which is expressed on few cells gp130 is expressed on all cell surfaces cells that express both the components of receptor complex are responsive to il-6 directly and this constitutes classic signaling pathway whereas cells that lack il-6r respond to il-6 bound to a soluble form of il-6r sil-6r via trans signaling pathway sil-6r is derived by the proteolytic cleavage of membrane bound il-6r with the help of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase adam enzyme activation of cells by il-6 through either of the complexes further activates janus kinase jakstat signal transduction pathway 59 60adipose tissue plays a crucial role in mediating inflammatory responses as they are the major source of cytokines chemokines and metabolically active mediators named adipokines obese people are shown to have higher levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- interleukin-1 beta and il-6 among various other cytokines all of which are produced by macrophages derived from adipose tissue these pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of adipocytes through various mechanisms elevated levels of inflammatory mediators are responsible for long-term effects on glucose homeostasis food intake regulation and inflammatory responses 6165il-6 tnf alpha and crp are all found to be substantially elevated in obese individuals positively correlating with bmi waist circumference and visceral adipose tissue these studies signify the role of obesity and its association with chronic underlying inflammatory state in body 56 66 67 further evidential proof to establish their correlation can be documented by studies that observed a significant decrease in levels of these inflammatory mediators on reducing weightadiposity in obese individuals 11 58 68amongst the various adipokines are the hormones secreted by adipose tissue that have proinflammatory actions such as leptin and anti-inflammatory actions like adiponectin 69 leptin is an essential hormone secreted in a pulsatile fashion in body and responsible for maintaining energy homeostasis in an organism besides its role in regulation of neuroendocrine functions leptin an anti-obesity hormone is found to be responsible for morbid obesity in leptin deficient states in animals as well as humans reversible on treatment with the hormone 70 the typical modern diet-induced obesity is characterized by hyperleptinemia elevated levels of leptin and resistance to the body weight reducing effects of leptin 71 72 leptin resistance disrupts endothelial leptin signaling pathway further leading to atherogenic state in obese individuals thus high levels of leptin along with leptin resistance in obesity is not only responsible for establishing a proinflammatory state but also makes the individual more prone to cardiovascular complications 7375adiponectin an exclusive adipokine derived from fat tissue exists in plasma in three major oligomeric forms based on their molecular weight low medium high it is well established that adiponectin levels correlate negatively with the amount of adipose tissue 69 76 clinical studies have linked low adiponectin levels to many obesity-related metabolic disorders 7779 it is an anti-inflammatory hormone that is found to be in negative association with crp and il-6 levels in obese individuals low adiponectin with elevated inflammatory mediators the findings were further corroborated when bodyweight reduction in obese individuals demonstrated reversal of the adiponectin crp and il-6 levels 80 81 this imbalance and reciprocal relationship of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines contributes to the development of obesity related metabolic and cardiovascular disordersin conclusion obesity is a co morbidity which propels covid-19 patients into a downhill course a low grade chronic inflammatory state in obesity as indicated by raised levels of crp and il-6 is responsible for initiating the cytokine storm in covid-19 patients upregulation of ace 2 receptors in adipocytes is another reason why obese individuals are more prone to infection with covid-19 and progressing into more severe forms of the disease a vast window of opportunity lies ahead for exploiting recombinant ace2 and aceatr1 blockade in the treatment of sars covid-19the recent outbreak of the new corona virus sars-cov-2covid-19 has spread throughout the globe at an alarming rate with many countries being scientifically medically economically socially andor politically unprepared to meet and respond to the pandemic threat the clinical spectrum of covid-19 ranges from an asymptomatic form to mild respiratory symptoms such as dry cough fever and moderate dyspnea to more severe presentations such as neurologic manifestations eg- cerebrovascular accident consequential to cytokine-induced changes in blood clotting direct encephalitic effects viral pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and sequential organ failure sof as result of cytokine storm1 2 ards requires the use of supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support and yet despite such measures often incurs high mortality 30-403 the number of patients who have required mechanical ventilation for extended periods of time produced an unanticipated shortage of these devices and imposed a significant  and often near catastrophic burden on hospital systems in this review we provide evidence that radiotherapy has been successfully used to treat a number of inflammatory infectious conditions including bacterialviral pneumonia in the 20th century and we opine that based upon its proposed mechanism of action this may represent a viable treatment option to reduce the cytokine storm-induced ubiquitous inflammatory effects that occurs in the majority of critically ill covid-19 patientssars-cov-2covid-19 virus belongs to the coronaviridae family and is a single-stranded rna virus that can infect both animals and humans the entry of pathogenic covid-19 virus in humans leads to activation of inflammatory cells specifically cd4 lymphocytes that subsequently transform to t helper 1 th1 cells th1 cells participate in increasing production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il1- il-2 il1ra il7 il8 il9 il10 gcsf gmcsf basic fgf2 ifn ip10 mcp1 mip1 mip1 pdgfb tnf and vegfa these mediators initiate the cascade of the accelerated inflammatory state the cytokines that appear to be most directly related to severity of respiratory illness in covid-19 are gcsf il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1 and tnf activated inflammatory cells th1 cells and macrophages enter the pulmonary circulation and induce a ubiquity of cytokines ie- cytokine storm that lead to rapid wide-spread damage of the pulmonary epithelium and alveolar cells as well as other vital organs1 4 5 6 7
recently the pathological features of covid-19 infection have been described to involve three stages stage one is incubation wherein the patient is most often asymptomatic and during which time the systemic viral titer may be low and thus may not be detectable stage two during which the patient is symptomatic but symptoms are not severe although the systemic viral load has increased and the virus is detectable and stage three in which symptoms become severe and the viral load is very high and detectable8 the immune response to covid-19 infection generally can assume one of two patterns the first entails an endogenous protective immune response that eliminates the virus and prevents progression to more severe stages of disease and the second which involves an impaired immune response upon entry of virus thereby leading to progressively more severe disease this latter pattern displays extensive involvement of organs expressing high concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 such as heart kidneys intestines and lungs with lung alveolar type ii pneumocytes being the principal target site of covid-19 virus the damage to these tissues initiates the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas cascade and induces pulmonary parenchymal inflammation via the activity of pro-inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes which leads to ards9 10 11
the cytokine storm induced by activated lymphocytes creates a systemic platform for the rapidly deteriorating presentations characteristic of critical covid-19 illness this hyper-inflammatory host-response poses significant challenges for medical management as efforts are being made to employ experimental drugs eg- cytokine inhibitors andor interleukin antagonists that may effectively modulate immune system responses individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes chronic renal disease andor chronic pulmonary disease are at greater risk of severe complications and mortality from respiratory viral infections such as covid-19 the diabetic hyperglycemic environment hinders immune responsivity and chronic renal disease establishes a pro-inflammatory state that manifests functional defects in both innate and adaptive immunity the lability of lung tissues in chronic pulmonary disease renders the pulmonary parenchyma pre-compromised and therefore at greater risk of ards these comorbidities dispose patients to both increased severity of covid-19-related multi-organ involvement and higher risk of mortality12 13 14 given current limitations and inadequacies in treating this disease we posit the utility and value of exploring and recognizing novel therapeutic modalities such as low dose radiotherapy rt which may prove to be of benefit to critically ill patientsa 2013 review of low dose rt by calabrese and dhawan illustrated the use of this approach to treat pneumonia during the 20th century15 the authors reported that approximately 700 patients of bacterial lobar and bronchopneumonia interstitial sulfanilamide resistant and atypical pneumonia were effectively treated by low doses of rt as well their discussion addresses studies with induced bacterial and viral pneumonia in four experimental animal models ie- mice guinea pigs cats and dogs the results of which supported the clinical findings the x-ray therapy successfully reduced the mortality from approximately 30 percent to 5-10 percent and clinical outcomes were further improved when these treatment effects were compared to cases treated with serum therapy or sulfonamides the positive therapeutic results occurred quickly within 05 hours to 3 hours and were often if not mostly evident after a single x-ray treatment the symptoms especially respiratory distress were rapidly relieved following administration of the x-ray dose this x-ray therapy was equivalently effective against viral pneumonia as well these findings were consistently reported by numerous clinicians in diverse medical settings with patients of highly variable health status disease history and age differences as well reports have noted successful treatment of bronchial asthma with x-rays in approximately 6000 cases16 the outcomes of several dozen studies indicated that approximately 4200 cases displayed remarkably rapid and marked reduction of pulmonary symptoms with fifty percent of these patients presenting complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms while essentially all historical human studies were case reports it should be noted that six studies incorporated comparison control groups that were unique to each study for example the types of controls ranged from the selection of alternative subjects into treatment and control groups the use of historical community control groups and similar national data as well as contemporary subjects with pneumonia in the same hospital served as controls the control group data in these respective studies tended to be generally consistent with the national normal at that time of about 30 mortality rates while these studies are not at the level of contemporary methodological study designed standards the multiple findings were highly consistent supported by responses in multiple animal models and supported with contemporary mechanistic findingscalabrese et al published in 2019 that low-dose rt induces a highly integrated complex and systemic response that involves polarization of macrophages to an m-2 anti-inflammatory phenotype17 this anti-inflammatory phenotype mediates decreased adhesion of leukocytes and polymorphonuclear cells pmns to endothelial cells decrease in reactive oxygen species ros reduction of nitric oxide no decreased inducible nitric oxide synthetase inos decrease in tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- and decreased tumor growth factor alpha tgf further and perhaps synergistically the low-dose rt induction of the m2 phenotype invokes increased heme oxygenase increased anti-inflammatory cytokines  interleukin-10 il-10 increased tumor necrosis factor-beta tnf- activation of several transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa beta nfkb and activating protein-1 ap-1 18 19 20 induction of apoptosis 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 increased tumor growth factor  beta 1 tgf1 19 20 and enhancement of t- regulatory cells20 28 29 low-dose rt can induce the m2 anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype irrespective of being administered to a localized inflamed area or to the whole body31 32
this putative mechanism of action is well-supported by the induction of anti-inflammatory phenotypes using low doses of ionizing radiation in a variety of in vivo models eg lewis rats balbc mice murine air pouch models with tuck mice dba mice human tumor necrosis factor 2 transgenic mice nmri mice c57 bc6 mice and in vitro models eg adult human peripheral mononuclear cells human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated murine macrophages-raw 2647 cells mouse resistant peritoneal macrophages murine endothelioma cell line mlend and the hybrid endothelial cell line ea-hy92633
in a recently published study abd el-fatah et al 2020 evaluated effects of low dose gamma radiation on systemic inflammatory disease ie- experimentally-induced arthritis in rats in which the inflammatory environment affected joints kidney liver and the hematological system the study demonstrated that low dose rt induced a clinically protective hormetic immune response arthritis was induced by injecting complete freunds adjuvant cfa resulting in marked increases in systemic lymphocytes both cd4 and cd8 additionally cfa- injected rats showed elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels these rats were exposed to low dose gamma radiation 025 gyweek x 4 treatment with low dose rt produced significant reduction p-value  001 in total leucocyte counts by 444  serum creatinine by 263  and serum liver enzymes by approximately 30 alanine aminotransferase alt 314 and aspartate aminotransferase ast 346 back towards normal values these results elucidate positive effects of low dose rt in reducing systemic inflammation and it was suggested that such therapeutics could be used in patient populations that present with multi-system pro-inflammatory states such as that incurred in chronic kidney disease34
using various murine models and human cell lines genard et al 2017 elaborated upon the possible molecular mechanisms that lead to the polarization of macrophages inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory their results demonstrated a triphasic dose response curve wherein low dose rt 1 gy and high dose rt 10 gy induced m2 polarization ie- anti-inflammatory phenotype while moderate dose of rt 1-10 gy induced m1 polarization ie- pro-inflammatory phenotype35
calabrese et al 2019 have indicated that diseases with a significant inflammatory component demonstrate reduced pathognomic features following exposure to radiation doses less than 10 gy ie- that induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype m2 polarization however diseases with an infectious component such as pneumonia gas gangrene sinusitis etc respond to radiation doses more than 10 gy ie- that induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype m1 polarization figure 1
17
the authors further suggested that the existence of m1 and m2 phenotypes at both the single cell and cell population levels is not absolute but rather represents a combinatory presentation of these phenotypes this hypothesis assumes that both pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes are simultaneously induced but the final phenotypic potential ie- which determines the relative constitution of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotype depends upon the radiation dose being greater or less than 10 gy17
in addition klug et al demonstrated that m1m2 polarization via low dose of rt also depends upon the tissue microenvironment36
based on the historical use of radiation to treat various inflammatory and infectious diseases calabrese et al 2019 proposed a dose range from 02  20 gy for optimal human therapeutic effectiveness 15 16 17 33 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 the authors assert that this dose range has the potential to induce polarization of both m1 and m2 macrophage phenotypes17
considering the available evidence and the proposed mechanism of action of low dose rt the authors recommend that a single total dose of 03-05 gy would be beneficial for covid-19 patients that present with and have corroborative clinical findings of cytokine storm this dose can be administered to the chest region using both anterior and posterior fields 50 of total dose administered in each field this targeted low dose of rt appears to be of most benefit in acute phase of illness when cytokines surge occurs and reduces the possibility of any immediate or long-term adverse effects considerably17
other potential benefits of using low dose rt for treatment of covid-19 patients with ards-the portability and ready availability of x-ray machines in hospitals allows researchers to deliver low dose rt in most hassle-free manner such as in an isolation room andor intensive care unit for patients on ventilators compared to high dose radiation therapy which needs to be done in a formal setting-in addition unlike vaccines and pharmacological treatments that are dependent on stock production and distribution from manufacturers x-ray devices are readily available in most of the clinical settings such as urgent care outpatient and hospital settings in fact areascountries with poor socioeconomic demographic profile and lack of infrastructure to avail costly trial drugs x-ray facilities are available to serve the purpose additional benefits of this treatment modality include exemption from any shortages in supply minimal immediate or long-term side effects
to be sure this remains speculative and it is imperative that the hormetic characteristics of the response to low dose rt be used to guide any experimental andor clinical intervention to such ends and based upon extant empirical findings we advocate and urge the critical importance of administering a single dose of 03 - 05 gy to patients experiencing pneumonia ards cytokine storm so as to attempt rapid amelioration of the systemic inflammatory cascade while avoiding unacceptable or adverse long-term effects of rt certainly we do not endorse the use of rt for all covid-19 patients but we do offer its consideration for those patients who are most critical and for whom other treatments options are unsuccessful or unavailablethis manuscript is a review article and thus did not need an ethics committee approval
30recent studies have suggested that hypoxia and adult respiratory distress syndrome ards may cause the release of a cytokine storm leading to multi-organ failure a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-a ifn-g il-1b il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf-a tgfb etc and chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 have also been reported 3 moreover it has been suggested that recruitment of aberrant cd45ra  t cells is the immunologic feature of covid-19 4furthermore it has been postulated that sars-cov-2 can dissociate oxy-hb carboxy-hb and glycosylated hb this may result in prolonged and progressive hypoxia eventually leading to desaturation and respiratory distressexcessive secretion of erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow in order to secrete new red blood cells to compensate for progressive and profound hypoxia may lead to thrombocytosis and a resultant hypercoagulable state evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic significantly higher d-dimer p  005 fibrin degradation products fdp levels p  005 and prolonged pt p  005 and aptt p  005 has been documented 5 a case with poor neonatal outcome with an apgar score of 0 and unsuccessful neonatal resuscitation 6 and the adverse effect on the type 2 pneumocytes have been recently reported 7therefore covid-19 results in an immunological response in a pregnant woman whose immune system is already altered as a result of normal physiological changes of pregnancy despite the lack of strong evidence that covid-19 is transferred in sufficient load across the placenta to cause fetal infection or an inflammatory response 8 9 10 it is likely that there would be a reactive response of the fetus secondary to a maternal inflammatory state in addition maternal pyrexia inflammatory mediators and cytokines may irritate the uterine myometrium leading to a reduction in utero-placental oxygen transferretrospective analysis of 12 anonymised ctg traces from pregnant women with symptomatic covid-19 infection from two different hospitals in spain was performed table 1

of reactive fetal response to maternal pyrexia and inflammatory response the gross fetal tachycardia 210 bpm seen in one case was most likely secondary to the maternal cytokine storm resulting in excessive fetal sympathetic response andor due to cardiac arrythmia secondary to excessive inflammatory mediators all fetuses showed absence of accelerations fig 1 this was most likely secondary to the depression of the fetal somatic nervous system by inflammatory mediators or due to ongoing hypoxia as a result of increased maternal or placental oxygen consumption leading to conservation of fetal somatic muscle activity late fig 2 or prolonged decelerations fig 3 which were observed in 10 out of 12 ctg traces 833  were either secondary to increased placental metabolism and resultant

showed absence of cycling fig 4 which was most likely due to the loss of the normal active and quiet sleep epochs secondary to placental transfer of maternal inflammatory mediators and resultant depressive effect on the fetal brain exaggerated or augmented variability 25bpm found in 33  confirming a zigzag pattern was most likely secondary to an autonomic instability as a result of fetal inflammatory response secondary to maternal cytokine storm and pyrexia none of the ctgs demonstrated a sinusoidal pattern which was suggestive that a chronic fetal anaemia secondary to haemolysis is a rare phenomenon in maternal covid-19 infection all ctg traces 100  where uterine activity was monitored 10 out of 12 cases showed evidence of excessive uterine activity which was most likely secondary to myometrial irritability due to maternal pyrexia and inflammatory response in the cases where delivery was accomplished 11 out of 12 the apgar scores at 5 min were normal 7 umbilical cord arterial ph was available in 9 cases and these showed absence of evidence of neonatal metabolic acidosis ph  70 these indicate that despite the observed abnormal patterns such as absence of accelerations increased baseline fhr and the presence of late or single prolonged decelerations on the ctg traces the perinatal outcomes were favourable this suggest that the observed abnormalities on the ctg trace were reactive changes in the fetus secondary to the pathophysiology o the maternal covid-19 infection this may have a significant clinical application as performing an urgent operative delivery or adjunctive tests such as fetal scalp blood sampling for a pathological ctg trace in covid-19 patients should be reviewed immediate measures to improve the maternal environment to correct maternal hypoxia maternal pyrexia and inflammatory response should be undertaken to rectify ctg changes prior to considering any intervention based on the observed abnormal ctg changes this is because the primary causes of abnormal ctg changes in maternal covid-19 infection are present within the maternal compartment it is also important to anticipate the ctg changes we have highlighted in maternal covid-19 infections by doing so unnecessary operative interventions based on ctg guidelines -which are produced to detect intrapartum hypoxia- could be avoided in maternal covid-19 infection where the primary pathology is inflammation and not hypoxiathe main strength of our study is that the authors analysed the ctg features that would be expected in maternal covid-19 patients based on the knowledge of pathophysiology instead of relying on standard ctg guidelines figo nice acog or national which are intended to recognise intrapartum hypoxia and not inflammation covid-19 infection is currently of immense clinical significance and therefore we hope the findings in our study will help avoid unnecessary operative interventions for abnormal ctg changes this may help avoid additional metabolic and stress response to an operative intervention in a woman who is already symptomatic of covid-19 infectionthe main limitation of our study is the small number however symptomatic maternal covid-19 infection is a novel relatively rare condition and therefore there is an urgent need to inform frontline clinicians of the abnormal ctg changes observed and the associated perinatal outcomes so that unnecessary operative interventions are avoided in pregnant women with symptomatic covid-19 infectionmaternal covid-19 infection appears to cause changes in the cardiotocograph ctg trace due to a combination of effects these include maternal hypoxia cytokine storm maternal pyrexia uterine irritability and diminished transfer of oxygen through the placenta this can be a consequence of increased placental metabolic demands and  or placental intervillous thrombosis secondary to maternal hypercoagulable state however as these are due to the pathology in the maternal environment despite the abnormal features observed on the ctg trace the neonatal outcome appears to be favourable therefore when abnormalities are observed on the ctg trace clinicians should aim to correct the pathology related to covid-19 within the mother in order to eliminate the detrimental effects of the maternal environment on the fetal heart rate whenever possible this should be done prior to rapidly transferring the mother for an operative delivery for a pathological ctg it is highly likely that by correcting the adverse maternal environment the ctg changes secondary to the effects of covid-19 infection could be reversed it is hoped that future research may help determine the time taken for the ctg changes to resolve after the correction of adverse maternal environmentthe authors declare

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has turned into a global pandemic no agent has proved effective against coronavirus infections and the development of novel therapeutics is critical to solve this public health crisis granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf an important myelopoietic growth factor and pro-inflammatory cytokine has attracted great interest as a therapeutic target in covid-19 increased percentages of gm-csf-expressing leukocytes have been found in the blood of patients with covid-19 ref1 and inhibition of gm-csf has shown benefit in animal studies of many hyperinflammatory conditions23 that are thought to be pathologically similar to late stages of covid-19 as of 28 may 2020 six companies had initiated randomized controlled clinical trials and open-label studies andor expanded accesscompassionate use programmes assessing the use of monoclonal antibodies mabs to gm-csf or gm-csf receptor gm-csfr to treat various stages of covid-19 refs49 conversely gm-csf plays an important role in alveolar macrophage homeostasis and lung pathogen clearance2 and investigator-initiated trials are studying the administration of recombinant human gm-csf sargramostim in patients with respiratory failure due to covid-19 this perspective provides a brief overview of the pleiotropic biology of gm-csf and examines the preclinical and clinical studies supporting the use of both sargramostim and gm-csf-targeting mabs in covid-19macrophage colony-stimulating factor m-csf granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf and gm-csf are implicated in myelopoiesis the production of monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils and basophils from progenitor cells m-csf and g-csf appear to be involved in steady-state myelopoiesis given that null mutants of the encoding genes in mice cause severe phenotypes for example skeletal and sensory defects and neutropenia1012 by contrast gm-csf is barely detectable in the blood of healthy individuals and is thought to serve less of a role in homeostatic myelopoiesis as evidenced by the fact that gm-csf-deficient mice have a virtually normal lifespan and have less dramatic alterations in the basal myeloid system1314importantly however gm-csf is known to be a critical homeostatic factor in lung alveoli where it is produced at low levels for the development and long-term maintenance of alveolar macrophages1516 severe deficiency of gm-csf for example due to autoantibodies to gm-csf or mutations that ablate gm-csfr function causes pulmonary alveolar proteinosis pap a life-threatening interstitial lung disease in which dysfunctional alveolar macrophages cannot clear surfactant16 patients with pap have increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections due to defective antimicrobial function of alveolar macrophages and basal circulating neutrophils caused by impaired gm-csf signalling1617 in mice gm-csf has been reported to be required for the steady-state maintenance of non-lymphoid tissue-resident cd103 dendritic cells across multiple tissues and this population of cells was shown to be critically important for the initiation of cd8 t cell responses in the lung1819 gm-csf thus serves a crucial role in normal lung health and can be important for host defenceduring inflammation gm-csf can be secreted by several different cell types including epithelial cells and leukocytes and is a critically important cytokine that can drive both innate and adaptive immune responses fig 1 gm-csfr is mainly expressed on myeloid cells generally restricting the direct-acting function of gm-csf to cells of this lineage gm-csf broadly serves two important roles during the immune response it polarizes mature myeloid cells into a pro-inflammatory phenotype paracrineautocrine function and it governs emergency myelopoiesis expanding and mobilizing progenitor myeloid cells to sites of inflammation endocrine function2 gm-csf-activated myeloid cells can secrete reactive oxygen species and express elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and tumour necrosis factor tnf and a variety of chemokines such as ccl2 il-8 and ccl17 which can attract monocytes neutrophils and lymphocytes respectively2 gm-csf can also enhance the ability of dendritic cells to prime t cells during antigen-specific immune responses1418 a distinct subset of cd4 t helper cells th cells that produce primarily gm-csf has been identified2023 these t cells can heighten the immune response by activating pro-inflammatory myeloid cells and recruiting them to sites of inflammation2022 thus it has been proposed that gm-csf serves as a primary communication conduit between inflammatory lymphoid and myeloid cells14the aberrant expression of gm-csf is known to drive excessive inflammation pain chemotaxis and tissue damage and to enhance the production of other pathogenic cytokines23 given the proposed role of gm-csf at the interface of lymphoid and myeloid cells it has been postulated that a gm-csf network promotes disease by driving inflammatory responses to become persistent or hyperactive2 this network is defined as a positive-feedback loop involving the interdependent secretion of gm-csf and pro-inflammatory cytokineschemokines across monocytesmacrophages th cells and neighbouring cell populations the cytokines most prominently implicated in this network are il-1 il-6 and tnf2 which have been targeted successfully in various inflammatory diseases and have now been suggested as potential targets in covid-19 refs2425gm-csf has been shown to be upregulated either systemically andor in the diseased tissues of patients with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis226 as well as in conditions that show similarities to late-stage covid-19 including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars27 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards28 cytokine release syndrome crs29 haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh30 hyperinflammation associated with graft-versus-host disease gvhd31 and other inflammatory diseases of the lung32 heart3335 and nervous system21233637 gm-csf-producing th cells have been identified as being involved in the pathogenesis of various immunological disorders for example rheumatoid arthritis26 multiple sclerosis2122 and sepsis38 reminiscent of the pathogenic th17 pathway known to drive disease pathology in multiple autoimmune contexts for example psoriasis39 gm-csf inhibition via neutralizing antibodies has shown beneficial effects in a diverse range of preclinical models including those of many of the aforementioned diseases3 in humans treatment with gm-csf-targeting mabs has demonstrated efficacy across multiple phase ii clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis with some potential advantages for example fewer off-target effects and decreased infection susceptibility over standard-of-care therapeutics such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs tnf-targeting agents and janus kinase inhibitors240 table 1although most infections are mild 20 of patients with covid-19 experience severe viral pneumonia that can progress to ards and death41 on the basis of emerging data as well as evidence from previous coronavirus epidemics42 a three-phase clinical staging model has been proposed for covid-19 1 fever cough and other relatively mild symptoms accompanying an increase in viral load 2 severe pneumonia that persists despite a decline in viral load due to a hyperactive immune response and 3 continuation of significant immune dysregulation resulting in pulmonary destruction cardiac instability multiorgan failure and death43 it has become increasingly well appreciated that the characteristic hyperactive immune response driving covid-19 progression consists of a cytokine storm overwhelming infiltration of inflammatory myeloid cells into the lungs particularly monocytes macrophages and neutrophils and even a disease phenotype resembling secondary hlh often referred to as macrophage activation syndrome254347 a subset of patients also experience acute myocardial injury andor neuropsychiatric symptoms which are associated with poor outcomes and may be caused by systemic inflammation4849 therapies aimed at increasing viral clearance strengthening lung tissue andor reducing the excessive host immune response may be able to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19recombinant human gm-csf sargramostim is fda-approved for multiple indications and its administration may provide several benefits to patients with covid-19 as mentioned already gm-csf is required to maintain pulmonary function and lung sentinel cell-mediated immunity1650 overexpression of gm-csf in mice prevented hyperoxia-induced lung injury by strengthening the resistance of alveolar wall cells to apoptosis and protecting against secondary bacterial infection5152 early elevated expression of gm-csf in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf of patients with acute lung injury and ards correlated with increased survival potentially owing to the enhanced survival of alveolar macrophages53 on the basis of these data a randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to study the use of intravenously administered recombinant human gm-csf in patients with acute lung injury or ards54 this trial failed to demonstrate reduction of ventilator-free days or mortality over the 28-day observation period however the study was underpowered owing to a slow recruitment pace n  130 of planned 200 participants54 and it has been hypothesized that local delivery of high levels of gm-csf directly to the lungs may be required for a therapeutic effect5556across many preclinical models of viral and bacterial pneumonia gm-csf expression in the lung has been shown to serve a beneficial role by enhancing repair of injured lung tissue and by activating innate and adaptive immune responses to clear pathogens19505663 in this context gm-csf is thought to act mainly on alveolar macrophages and tissue-resident cd103 dendritic cells and there is even evidence that gm-csf directly modulates alveolar epithelial cells195064 pretreatment with intranasally administered gm-csf protected mice from lethal influenza-induced lung injury5660 and lung-specific overexpression of gm-csf after influenza viral infection in an inducible transgenic mouse model significantly increased survival61 inhaled gm-csf also protected against secondary bacterial infection in a postinfluenza pneumococcal pneumonia mouse model62 conversely gm-csf-deficient mice showed no survival 48 hours after intratracheal inoculation with gram-negative bacteria compared with 100 survival in controls due to impaired alveolar macrophage bactericidal function63 during infection resolution gm-csf was shown to mediate macrophageepithelial cell crosstalk stimulating alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and barrier repair6465 in six patients with pneumonia-associated ards compared with an external control group increased oxygenation and lung compliance were observed following treatment with inhaled gm-csf on a compassionate use basis however these results will need to be verified in controlled studies55 currently a randomized open-label investigator-initiated trial is ongoing to assess inhaled andor intravenously administered sargramostim in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to covid-19 n  80 nct0432692066 a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study has also been initiated to assess intravenously administered sargramostim in 30 patients with respiratory failure due to covid-19 nct0440092966 table 1 this strategy may prove useful for stabilizing alveolar macrophage and epithelial cell function increasing sars-cov-2 clearance protecting against secondary infection and contributing to lung repair mechanismssargramostim is typically used clinically to expand bone marrow progenitor cells and promote myeloid reconstitution for example in cases of neutropenia following chemotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplantation in apparent contradiction to the data presented in the previous subsection the sargramostim fda label cautions against treating patients with hypoxia because its administration has been shown to induce respiratory symptoms due to excessive granulocyte mobilization into the lungs from the circulation67 it was demonstrated in healthy volunteers that neutrophils primed ex vivo with gm-csf are sequestered in the pulmonary vasculature whereas little to no retention was observed with non-primed cells68 considering that neutrophil accumulation in the lung is a hallmark of ards69 it is noteworthy that acute lung injury has been reported as a potential complication of sargramostim use in rare cases70 gm-csf has been shown to boost neutrophil survival in ards and thus inhibition of the gm-csf pathway has been proposed as a potential ards therapeutic approach172871 contrary to recommendations in many of the aforementioned reportsgiven the aforementioned literature careful monitoring will be needed with sargramostim use in the covid-19 setting particularly as late stages of covid-19 are thought to be driven by host overactive immunity rather than high viral load43 gm-csf administration can induce flu-like symptoms leukocytosis and capillary leak syndrome67 therefore posing the potential risk of exacerbating the sars-cov-2-induced hyperinflammatory response balf analyses of patients with covid-19 have shown that alveolar macrophages are depleted in patients with severe covid-19 refs46 indicating perhaps that gm-csf administration may be more beneficial in patients with earlier-stage covid-19 indeed the covid-19 trials assessing gm-csf administration exclude patients with ferritin levels greater than 2000 g ml1 consistent with ongoing hlh and thus may treat patients before they progress to an overt hyperinflammatory phenotypeanti-inflammatory therapies have attracted great interest in covid-19 and an immunomodulatory agent that is able to prevent or reduce the disease-driving hyperactive immune response could be a beneficial therapy for late-stage covid-19 ref25 in covid-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is thought to be an important mediator of tissue damage hypercoagulation and the cytokine storm4472 balf analyses from patients with mild or severe covid-19 showed that patients with severe covid-19 experienced significant lung infiltration by circulating inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages46 due to its role as a myeloid cell growth factor and pro-inflammatory cytokine gm-csf may be a key driver of the immunopathological sequelae of covid-19although virtually undetectable in the circulation of healthy individuals14 gm-csf was recently noted as being upregulated in the serum of a subset of patients with covid-19 ref73 it was reported that the percentages of gm-csf-expressing cd4 t cells cd8 t cells natural killer cells and b cells were significantly higher in the blood of patients with covid-19 who were admitted to an intensive care unit icu than in healthy controls1 this pan-cellular observation was not seen with il-6 and tnf expression in the respective populations furthermore a gm-csfifncd4 t cell signature which is associated with gvhd31 and autoimmune arthritis26 encephalomyelitis74 and diabetes75 was found in the peripheral blood of the patients in the icu these t cell responses were accompanied by a significant increase in the numbers of cd14cd16 inflammatory monocytes and a high percentage of monocytes secreted gm-csf and il-6 ref1 the reported immunological changes appeared to be more pronounced in patients admitted to an icu than in those who did not require icu care and thus appear to correlate with clinical severity similarly a study in patients with sepsis demonstrated that an increased percentage of circulating gm-csf-producing th cells is predictive of poor outcome and is correlated with il-1 and il-6 expression these cells exhibited a memory phenotype and were reported to be mediators of dysfunctional neutrophil activity38 however given the role of gm-csf in pathogen clearance and lung repair it is important to consider that gm-csf levels may be elevated as a compensatory mechanism or as a background consequence of increased covid-19 severity further studies are therefore needed to determine whether increased production of gm-csf in patients with covid-19 represents a physiological response to infection or a pathogenic driver of diseasewe along with others172 suggest that in patients with covid-19 dysregulated gm-csf expression could induce overactivation of myeloid cells that secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and destructively infiltrate tissue such as the lungs and potentially even the heart and the nervous system this suggestion is consistent with the disease-driving mechanism of action of gm-csf proposed in many preclinical models with pathologies similar to that of late stages of covid-19 including models of chimeric antigen receptor car t cell-related crs and neurotoxicity76 gvhd-associated crs31 septic shock7778 neuroinflammatory disease21 inflammatory lung conditions717985 and acute cardiovascular diseases myocarditis86 myocardial infarction33 and vasculitis87 therapeutic inhibition of gm-csf has shown benefit including survival advantages in all of these preclinical models by decreasing the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokineschemokines and reducing tissue infiltration by inflammatory immune cells23 of note a recent report described an outbreak of kawasaki-like disease in sars-cov-2-infected children88 and gm-csf neutralization via mab in a mouse model of kawasaki disease led to significant reductions in disease incidence and severity89 with respect to the lung systemic monoclonal anti-gm-csf administration after intranasal lipopolysaccharide challenge in mice reduced the lung accumulation of myeloid cells in a dose-dependent manner79 a similar benefit was achieved with the use of gm-csf neutralization to treat inflamed lungs in multiple other mouse studies8083 a phase ii trial of monoclonal anti-gm-csf administration in patients with asthma demonstrated no benefit in the overall population but statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the primary outcome measure in prespecified subgroups32in mouse models of sars-cov infection gm-csf was proposed as a mediator of the lethal sars-cov-induced infiltration of inflammatory monocytesmacrophages into the lungs90 gm-csf was upregulated before all other cytokines il-6 tnf and ifn and chemokines ccl2 ccl7 and ccl12 that were measured indicating that gm-csf might be involved in the initiation of this immunopathological process in these studies genetically modified mice ifnar mice which cannot respond to type i interferon did not experience the early upregulation of gm-csf and were protected from the cellular infiltration and death90 experimental depletion of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages resulted in significantly reduced morbidity and mortality 100 survival out to 2 weeks versus 2040 in controls and increased numbers of virus-specific t cells in the lungs demonstrating the therapeutic potential of downregulating inflammatory myeloid cells in coronavirus infections90together these data suggest that the use of mabs to gm-csf or gm-csfr might be a promising therapeutic strategy for curbing the hyperactive host immune response observed in covid-19 a number of large clinical trials in patients with covid-19 are currently assessing similar immunomodulatory strategies these include il-6 targeting via sarilumab or tocilizumab the latter of which is fda-approved for car t cell-related crs72 and il-1 blockade with anakinra or canakinumab7291 recently a data monitoring committee analysis of an ongoing phase iiiii randomized controlled trial of sarilumab showed a large reduction in c-reactive protein levels and an increase versus placebo on ventilator-free survival in critical patients with covid-19 requiring high-flow oxygenation mechanical ventilation or icu care at study entry n  44 receiving placebo n  88 receiving high-dose sarilumab therapy no p values reported92 the data monitoring committee recommended stopping the assessment of low-dose treatment as well as discontinuing the enrolment of patients with severe disease requiring supplemental oxygen without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation and patients exhibiting multiorgan system dysfunction demonstrating the importance of timing and dose strength for the use of immunomodulatory biologics in covid-19 ref92 the careful assessment of the designs and results of these types of cytokine-targeting mab clinical trial will be important for setting expectations and implementing amendments during the ongoing gm-csf-targeted mab clinical trials in patients with covid-19because gm-csf can stimulate the expression of il-1 il-6 tnf and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines a gm-csf-targeting strategy might have broader effects than other immunomodulatory approaches when one is seeking to therapeutically dampen overactive immune responses this hypothesis is supported by data from clinical trials in which gm-csf-targeted therapy was shown to be efficacious in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were unresponsive to tnf-targeted therapy9394 in a head-to-head study comparing gm-csf blockade with monoclonal anti-tnf therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis gm-csf blockade induced a sustained reduction in the levels of markers of inflammation such as c-reactive protein and il-6 whereas monoclonal anti-tnf therapy did not in the particular population under study40 even given the benefits of tocilizumab in crs it has been speculated that patients can become refractory owing to early and sustained upregulation of gm-csf769596 and clinical trials are ongoing or planned to assess the benefit of gm-csf-targeting mabs in car t cell-related crs and in crs associated with gvhd46in summary these data suggest that gm-csf can have a master regulatory effect on cytokine expression and myeloid cell-mediated hyperinflammation including in the lung many of the preclinical and clinical data from the gm-csf-targeting mab therapeutic class come from inflammatory disorders not caused by a viral pathogen making extrapolation to covid-19 difficult however as mentioned earlier late stages of covid-19 appear to be driven not by active viral replication and cell lysis but instead by host immunopathology  particularly myeloid cell immunopathology  that is similar to many aspects of these disorders4372 thus the putative pathogenic role of gm-csf in immune overactivation across many studies provides a rationale for the initiation of the ongoing randomized controlled trials using gm-csf-targeting mabs for the treatment of patients with covid-19 table 1given the homeostatic role of gm-csf in the lung blocking gm-csf action in patients with covid-19 comes with the potential risks of compromising alveolar macrophage function and hindering pathogen clearance as with any anti-inflammatory approach under investigation in covid-19 close monitoring for evidence of viral exacerbation will be needed importantly mabs to gm-csf and gm-csfr have demonstrated a strong safety profile to date across more than 1000 patients treated in multiple phase ii trials2 including a long-term safety study where patients were receiving the therapy for a median of 25 years97 although secondary infections could have been expected as can be observed in patients receiving tnf- or il-6-targeted therapy no increase in tuberculosis and other serious infections has so far been noted2 while pap is of theoretical concern no patient has developed this disease in any monoclonal anti-gm-csf or monoclonal anti-gm-csfr trial to date it has been hypothesized that primary pap can develop only from dramatic and sustained gm-csf neutralization by polyclonal antibodies for example autoantibodies98in the covid-19 setting therapeutic intervention will occur over a short time frame likely 2 weeks or less lessening the risk of lung toxicity furthermore the timing of mab administration may be very important although gm-csf could be beneficial for maintaining alveolar macrophage function during the viral assault in the early disease phase neutralizing gm-csf may be able to reduce the primary pathology of the cytokine storm and myeloid cell-induced lung destruction in later disease stagesa number of clinical trials of systemically administered mabs to gm-csf or gm-csfr have been completed or are ongoing for inflammatoryautoimmune conditions recently six companies initiated clinical studies assessing these mabs for the treatment of covid-19 table 1 encouraging data were obtained from an open-label cohort study of patients with covid-19 treated with the gm-csfr mab mavrilimumab n  13 compared with a matched contemporaneous untreated control group n  266 benefits in the mavrilimumab-treated group were reported across multiple clinically relevant end points including time to hospital discharge and mortality mavrilimumab was observed to be well tolerated in all patients with no infusion reactions6 however these findings need to be confirmed in larger studies that are placebo controlledas of 28 may 2020 six randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials were ongoing for gm-csf-targeting mabs in covid-19 table 1 the lenzilumab trial n  238 nct04351152 excludes patients with ards and the mavrilimumab trials n  60 nct04399980 n  50 nct04397497 exclude patients receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization by contrast the otilimab n  800 nct04376684 gimsilumab n  270 nct04351243 and tmj2 n  144 nct04341116 trials allow inclusion of these patients the differing target patient populations in these studies should indicate whether targeting gm-csf may be effective at early andor late stages of covid-19 of note there is expected to be little difference between targeting the gm-csf ligand versus the receptor because both strategies block the same interaction indeed preclinical and clinical trial data in rheumatoid arthritis have shown similar benefits for these two approaches2we have provided the rationale and risks for both therapeutically administering and inhibiting gm-csf in covid-19 given the pleiotropic roles of gm-csf in lung health host defence and inflammation care should be taken with respect to dose route and timing of administration for each therapeutic approach gm-csf administration in patients with covid-19 may improve lung function by strengthening the alveolar wall and enhancing viral clearance and this approach may thus provide particular benefit in early stages of covid-19 by contrast gm-csf or gm-csfr blockade could be a beneficial treatment for the cytokine storm and inflammatory myeloid cell tissue infiltration associated with moderate-to-severe covid-19 the gm-csf blockade strategy may have broad immunomodulatory effects given that it could affect the secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by myeloid cells in our view the gm-csf-based therapies are worthwhile investigational approaches during the urgent global search for effective covid-19 therapeuticsthe recent ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia covid-19 has sparked worldwide concern first reported in december 2019 in wuhan covid-19 spread rapidly across other areas and caused a major epidemic with 80894 confirmed cases including 3237 deaths in china by 17 march 17 2020 a novel highly infectious coronavirus officially called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen of this outbreak by deep sequencing and etiological investigations 13 as global new cases spike in 75 more countries apart from china who has declared that covid-19 is currently a global public health emergency according to previous studies of clinical characteristics the most common symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection are fever cough fatigue shortness of breath and abnormalities on chest ct 46 however some covid-19 patients rapidly develop severe pneumonia symptoms and complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards pulmonary oedema acute kidney injury or multiple organ failure 46 the case fatality rate of covid-19 is around 37 according to the national official statistics in chinadespite increasing global threats of covid-19 the host immune response against sars-cov-2 infection remains poorly understood viral rnas are recognized by the innate immune system through three major classes of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors toll-like receptors tlrs rig-i-like receptors rlrs and nod-like receptors nlrs which trigger the expression of interferon ifn and activation of anti-viral effectors such as natural killer cells t cd8 cells and macrophages 710 coronaviruses such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have evolved strategies to dampen or delay ifn production which usually trigger exuberant inflammatory host responses leading to severe lung pathology 81113 it is believed that dysregulated host immune response and production of inflammatory cytokines known as the cytokine storm correlates with disease severity and poor prognosis during sars-cov and mers-cov infection 8914 several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as ccl-2 ccl-3 rantes il-2 and il-8 were aberrantly elevated during mers-cov infection of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages 815 interestingly recent studies have reported that severe cases of covid-19 exhibit increased plasma levels of il2 il6 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf compared with mild cases indicating inflammatory cytokine release is critical in covid-19 progression 45 lymphopenia was common in sars-cov-2 infected patients probably due to lymphocytes induced apoptosis 4516 furthermore clinical pathological analysis of covid-19 biopsy samples confirmed interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in lung tissues 17 however the underlying molecular mechanisms of the aberrant inflammatory responses in serology and histopathology under sars-cov-2 infection are still not cleartranscriptomic analyses of cells upon virus infection are extremely useful to identify the host immune response dynamics and gene regulatory networks 1819 in this study we use rna sequencing techniques to investigate the transcriptional changes in balf and pbmc specimens of covid-19 patients through transcriptomic analyses of these datasets we identified several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by sars-cov-2 infection notably ccl2 cxcl2 ccl8 cxcl1 il33 ccl3l1 in balf and cxcl10 tnfsf10 timp1 c5 il18 areg nrg1 il10 in pbmc evidencing a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm in the patients kegg pathway analysis of pbmc transcriptome revealed that patients lymphopenia may be caused by activation of apoptosis and p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes altogether our data suggest that sars-cov-2 infection-induced excessive cytokine release correlates with lung tissue injury and covid-19 pathogenesisthis study was approved by the ethics committee of the zhongnan hospital of wuhan university the rna-seq analyses of balf samples and pbmc were performed on existing samples collected during standard diagnostic tests posing no extra burden to patientswhole blood and pbmc ficoll preparation were obtained from 3 sars-cov-2 patients and 3 healthy donors at zhongnan hospital of wuhan university peripheral blood sample 4 ml from each

twice with 10 ml pbs and centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes the precipitate was collected and the total rna was extracted2 lidocaine was injected into the segment of the lung for local anesthesia 100

visualizing the ppi subnetworkthe source codes for the analysis are available at the httpsgithubcomzhouyulabncovthe raw sequencing data from this study have been deposited in the genome sequence archive 30 in big data center httpsbigdbigaccn 31 beijing institute of genomics big chinese academy of sciences under the accession number cra002390to investigate the impact and mechanism of sars-cov-2 infections in patients we exploited rna-seq to detect transcriptome changes in both pmbc and balf samples from healthy donors and covid-19 patients figure 1a we got samples from zhongnan hospital of wuhan university including balf samples from two patients whu01-2 and blood samples from 3 patients p1-3 and 3 healthy individuals n1-3 the data for 3 balf healthy samples ctrl1-3 were from a previous study 20 we utilized ficoll density gradient centrifugation to isolate pbmc in the blood followed by rna library construction and high-throughput sequencing
we performed quality control analysis on the rna-seq data and summarized the statistics of reads mapped to the human genome and the sars-cov-2 genome genbank mn988668 in the supplementary tables 1 and 2 for balf and pbmc samples respectively consistent with our previous report focusing on viral genome assembly 3 balf patient samples contain high ratio of viral reads while healthy control datasets have zero counts interestingly pbmc samples from patients barely exhibit viral reads indicating that sars-cov-2 may not infect pbmc the data illustrated high consistency within control or patients groups as demonstrated by the correlation and clustering analysis of balf and pbmc samples respectively supplementary fig s1a and s1bfor balf samples we detected 9609 expressed genes in which 679 genes are up-regulated and the 325 genes are decreased in patients compared with healthy individuals supplementary fig s2a the differentially expressed genes are represented in scaled heatmap comparing patients to healthy controls for both balf figure 1b and supplementary file 1 and pbmc samples figure 1c and supplementary file 1 for pbmc samples we found more genes 15726 with rna expression signals in which 707 genes are significantly up-regulated while 316 genes are down-regulated supplementary fig s2b interestingly as illustrated by the rna-seq signals shown in the genome browser il6 and il6r are decreased in 2 out of 3 patients figure 1de while tp53 expression shows an increased trend figure 1f although they are not identified as significantly changed genes statisticallyin sum our data provide a global and quantitative resource for investigating the rna regulation upon sars-cov-2 infectionvirus infection may induce dynamic changes of gene expression in specific cellular biological processes we performed gene functional enrichment analysis of the differentially regulated genes in balf and pbmc to monitor the changes in cells of patients and healthy persons for balf samples the up-regulated genes are related to invasion of the virus figure 2a and supplementary file 2 viral infection-induced changes in various membrane structures and endoplasmic reticulum indeed the most enriched biological processes are cotranslational protein targeting to membrane protein targeting to er and viral transcription however up-regulated genes in pbmc are mainly enriched in complement activation humoral immune response mediated by circulating immunoglobulin and b cell mediated immunity figure 2b and supplementary file 2 indicating activated immune activity in pmbc in addition a series of inflammation-related processes was activated such as regulation of acute inflammatory response and acute inflammatory response supplementary file 2
interestingly the decreased genes in balf of patients are enriched in biological processes of activation of immune cells figure 3a and supplementary file 3 in contrast the decreased genes in pbmc of patients are involved in other biological processes such as axon guidance neuron projection guidance and mrna-related biological processes figure 3b and supplementary file 3
furthermore kegg pathway analysis was performed for these up- and down-regulated genes in balf samples the pathways enriching changed genes include ribosome protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum phagosome pentose phosphate pathway carbon metabolism and lysosome figure 2a and figure 3a supplementary file 2 and file 3 for pbmc samples cell cycle and metabolism pathways enrich up-regulated genes while cytokine-related pathways enrich down-regulated genes such as viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor nfkappa b signaling pathway tolllike receptor signaling pathway and il17 signaling pathway figures 2 and 3b supplementary file 2 and file 3 the interacting proteins to the differentially expressed genes in balf and pbmc were also identified from the functional human network to obtain a global understanding of their interaction network supplementary fig s3according to previous clinical reports covid-19 patients have cytokine storm which is in reminiscence of sars-cov infection 41232 we identified all expressed cytokines in balf figure 4a and pbmc figure 4b with significantly changed genes marked by an asterisk as in clinical cases high cytokine expression was observed in the balf in agreement with laboratory findings we found cytokines il10 ccl2mcp-1 cxcl10ip-10 ccl3mip-1a and ccl4mip1b are highly expressed in patients balf samples further comparison between the two patients whu01 and whu02 indicated the expression of some cytokines such as il10 il36rn il36g tnfsf15 ccl5 tnfsf10 cxcl1 and il33 are variable among patients
laboratory findings of the 3 patients supplementary table 3 indicated cell count reduction of various types of immune cells including lymphocytes in patients blood previous clinical and autopsy reports indicated that patients lymphocytes have been greatly reduced 5 we found that several significantly altered genes are enriched to the apoptosis and p53 signaling pathways figure 5 including ctsl ctsb ddit4 rras ctsd birc5 tnfsf10 ctsz ntrk1 igfbp3 ccnb1 rrm2 ccnb2 gtse1 cdk1 steap3 and tp53i3 interestingly tp53 an important gene in the process of apoptosis shows an increasing trend in two patients indicating that pmbcs reduction may be due to apoptosis
based on the differential gene expression analysis we found that there are significant differences in the levels of intracellular gene changes between the balf samples and pbmc this distinction is due to differences in viral infections to the two types of cells of note the virus seems not to infect pbmc as that we failed to detect viral rnas as well as ace2 expression in pbmc supplementary tables 1 and 2 which was also supported by the expression data base of bone marrow-derived blood cells httpwwwaltanalyzeorg in order to illustrate the differences between the two cell types we classified genes with different trends between the balf samples and pbmc figure 6ab there are 17 genes that change in the same direction while 36 genes have opposite trends we first analysed genes that increased in pbmc but decreased in blaf among the 15 genes 5 genes are participated in small molecule catabolic process ada2 hk1 mgat1 pgd and pla2g15 and 4 genes are involved in neutrophil activation and immunity ada2 ctsd gaa lair1 supplementary file 4 next we analysed genes that increased in blaf but decreased in pbmc which were listed in figure 6b although there are 17 genes changing in the same trend between the two samples the biological meaning still needs further investigation
the infection of sars-cov-2 can cause severe pulmonary disease and complications with significant morbidities and mortalities currently there is no optimal treatment or effective drug for this fatal lung disease our understanding of the host immune response to sars-cov-2 infection is limited making it difficult to design novel therapeutics viral infection usually causes massive alterations in the host transcriptome leading to aberrant host cell metabolism and modulated immune response which is ideal for viral replication 1233 using several patients and healthy individuals balf and pbmc samples we performed genome-wide rna-sequencing to characterize the host immune response in covid-19 patients we found that 1004 and 1023 genes were differential expressed p  005 when balf and pbmc samples of covid-19 patients were compared to control respectively as expected these genes fall into categories including humoral immune response lymphocyte mediated immunity and complement activation which all play important roles in restricting viral infectioninflammatory response in viral pneumonia can be a double-edged sword although beneficial inflammation is necessary for the local tissues to fight infection exacerbated inflammatory responses in pneumonia patients result in excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm leading to detrimental outcomes such as diffuse alveolar damage and fibrosis progressive respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction43435 the newly emerged sars-cov-2 virus shares the same human receptor ace2 with sars-cov virus 1 one of the hallmarks of sars disease are systemic inflammation and cytokine storm with increased level of il-6 il-8 cxcl10ip-10 ccl2mcp-1 and ccl3mip-1a 1236 little is known about the immunopathology of covid-19 diseases recent clinical investigation reveals that covid-19 mild patients had high level of il1b ifn cxcl10ip-10 and ccl2mcp-1 while patients requiring icu admission had higher level of gcsf cxcl10ip-10 ccl2mcp-1 and ccl3mip-1a 4 consistently in this study we found the expression of a large number of cytokines are significantly elevated in covid-19 patients balf samples compared to control including pro-inflammatory cytokines cxcl1 cxcl2 cxcl6 cxcl8 cxcl10ip-10 ccl2mcp-1 ccl3mip-1a and ccl4mip1b these data suggest sars-cov-2 virus infection led to cytokine storm which correlated with disease severity increased transcription of respective chemokines receptors such as ccr2 ccl2mcp-1 receptor and ccr5 ccl3mip-1a receptor was also observed indicating the activation of these inflammatory signaling cytokineschemokines and their receptors play an important role in the cytokine migration and activation of immune cells at the sites of infection 37 it has been shown that ccr2 and ccr5 deficient mice infected with mouse-adapted sars-cov virus exhibited defects in directing inflammatory cell to the airway causing severe disease and increased mortality 38 in addition our results reveal that high levels of macrophages chemoattractant cxcl10ip-10 and ccl2mcp-1 and neutrophil chemoattractant cxcl2 and cxcl8 facilitate the migration of these immune cells to the site of infection which was consistent with mononuclear cell infiltrates in lung tissues of covid-19 patients 17induction of inflammatory cytokines is tightly controlled to prevent tissue damage and maintain a proper immune homeostasis it has been shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 which is required for the regulation of inflammatory response b-cell differentiation and antibody production was increased in sars patients 3940 laboratory findings indicated serum il-6 protein level increased in 2 out of 3 patients supplementary table 3 however il-6 transcription levels did not significantly change in pbmc figure 1d and supplementary file 1 indicating that the secreted il-6 protein in serum might be from lung epithelial cells very recently administration of the anti-il-6-r antibody tocilizumab has been proposed as a treatment in clinical practice by ameliorating inflammation of covid-19 patients of note we noticed that relatively lower expression levels of il6r was observed in balf of covid-19 patients compared with healthy individual supplementary file 1 and there are no significant differences in pbmc figure 1e and supplementary file 1 suggests that il-6il6r axis of cells in balf and pbmc might not be involved in the pathophysiology of covid-19 disease a more comprehensive clinical study and larger scale of transcriptome profiling with more cases is needed to evaluate the justification of anti-il-6 mab treatmentmoreover we found that anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 and tgf-b were also induced upon sars-cov-2 virus infection resembling the high tgf-b activity found in sars patients 3441 tgf-b is a multifunctional cytokine which regulated a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation differentiation apoptosis and immune responses 42 additionally tgf-b signaling can be modulated by virus infection to block cell apoptosis and to promote fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation thus plays a critical role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis 43 recently covid-19 patients lung biopsy has been shown mild fibrosis and moderate inflammation 17 our data suggests that increased expression of tgf-b in covid-19 patients might be the cause of pulmonary fibrosislymphopenia have been found in a large portion of sars and covid-19 patients although the underlying mechanism remains unclear 464447 viral infection of lymphocytes was barely detected in sars patients 48 similarly we have not observed any viral gene expression in patients pbmc indicating sars-cov-2 virus may not infect lymphocytes in covid-19 patients among these 3 patients autophagy p53 and apoptosis pathways are highly expressed in pbmc of covid-19 patients compared with healthy individual due to its anti-inflammatory effect glucocorticoids have been widely used to stop the progression of the acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in sars and covid-19 patients by suppressing lung inflammation 449 however glucocorticoids treatment has been criticized for its significant side effects including immunosuppression impaired antibody responses delayed viral clearance and more severely avascular necrosis and osteoporosis 444951 collectively lymphopenia in sars and covid-19 patients was more likely caused by endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids which ultimately led to apoptosis of lymphocytes rather than direct viral infection of these cells 4450in summary the present work demonstrated that sars-cov-2 virus infection stimulates a unique transcriptome profile in covid-19 patients balf and pbmc additionally the cytokine expression profile suggests excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine release might be a hallmark of covid-19 patients furthermore the covid-19 patients balf

hyperferritinemic syndrome encompasses four clinical conditions macrophage activation syndrome mas adult-onset stills disease aosd catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome caps and septic shock all characterized by high serum ferritin and a life-threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure 1 in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 the disease-associated to the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 outbreak a pandemic a significant amount of covid-19 patients is currently experiencing severe interstitial pneumonia possibly ending up with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs this severe form of covid-19 shares several clinical and laboratory features with the four entities mentioned above and currently included in the definition of hyperferritinemic syndromes 2 this concept may guide and support therapeutic choices as all these entities respond to a similar approach consisting of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents such as glucocorticoids ivig cyclosporin il-1 and il-6 inhibition 12 plasmapheresis or il-18 blockade may be considered as well 13 some preliminary results confirm the beneficial effects of tocilizumab in covid-19 4 and current recommendations 5 advocate its use in those patients evolving toward the most severe stage of illness characterized by an extra-pulmonary systemic hyper-inflammation 6the idea of a third later stage of covid-19 as the dramatic result of an overwhelming cytokine storm 7 is strengthened by the observation of the increased level of different molecules including il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf ifn granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon--inducible protein ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a platelet-derived growth factor pdgf tumor necrosis factor tnf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf 89 especially in severe cases il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf seem to be extremely high 89 a significant elevation of il-6 in non-survival patients has been also described 10the main clinical and laboratory features characterizing patients with hyperferritinemic syndromes are described in table 1
and compared with covid-19 severe manifestations as already mentioned in addition to cytokine profile other features make covid-19 similar to the members of the hyperferritinemic syndrome at least in some of their stages lymphopenia reduced nk number and activity abnormal liver function tests coagulopathy and of course hyperferritinemia 111hyperferritinemia is the hallmark of the hyperferritinemic syndromes and along the last decade increasing evidence supports the idea that high circulating ferritin may not only reflect an acute phase response but also play a critical role in inflammation 12 ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein and the ratio between its two subunits h and l may differ depending on tissue type and physiologic status of the cell 13 h-ferritin seems to display not only an immunomodulatory function 1415 but also a pro-inflammatory activity culminating with the induction of the expression of different inflammatory mediators including il-1 16 hyperferritinaemia characterizes several autoimmune diseases 17 where it may play a pathogenetic role on the ground of its immunomodulatory properties 12 the origin of circulating serum ferritin during inflammatory conditions is still debated in vitro experiments demonstrated that ferritin might be actively secreted by hepatocytes 18 as well as by macrophages through a non-classical pathway 19 thus it is likely that in hyperferritinemic syndromes macrophage activation could actively contribute to ferritin production in line with this hypothesis in a previous study we demonstrated that in aosd ferritin serum levels are not only correlated with disease activity but also with macrophage activation 20 interestingly in a very recent study describing a cohort of 39 hospitalized patients with covid-19 ferritin serum levels were found significantly correlated with disease severity 21 besides an active secretion during the inflammatory reaction a major component of serum ferritin derives by cellular death in particular by hepatic cells death once released ferritin loses part of the inner iron content giving rise to extremely high serum levels of free iron 22 it seems that the excess of circulating free iron detectable during severe inflammatory conditions can deteriorate the inflammatory reaction with the particular ability to induce a marked pro-coagulant state 22 this capacity is related to changes in the morphology of red blood cells and fibrin induced by free iron able itself to favor the production of hydroxyl radical 22 oxidative stress on red blood cells and fibrin can induce the production of dense clots responsible for stroke development 23 due to the capacity of iron chelation to taper the inflammatory response through a reduction of ros production and to promote an anti-viral activity the utility of this therapeutic approach in patients with sars-cov-2 infection has been recently addressed 24 a clinical trial on the use of desferal deferoxamine a medication able to bind iron in case of iron overdose is currently ongoing in iran in patients with mild to severe covid-19 infection nct04333550coagulopathy is one of the main complications occurring in hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 despite prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin the occurrence of cardiovascular stroke is extremely high in some cases in the form of a diffused intravascular coagulopathy dic in a chinese cohort from wuhan dic occurred in about 64 of patients who died n  109 for severe covid 25 acro-ischemia is one of the most frequent presentations of this complication being associated with a significant rate of death 26 dic is a known major complication also of the other hyperferritinemic syndromes including aosd 27 mas 28 sepsis 29 and of course caps inflammation induces increased coagulation by two different effects by activating the cascade coagulation system and by downregulating the anti-coagulant mechanisms 29 the endothelial cell and platelet activation occurring in caps is a key contributor to the genesis of a thrombotic storm 30 and in this setting it is remarkable the role of infections as triggers of the disease 31 it is of note that three chinese covid-19 patients admitted to icu and presenting thrombotic events tested positive for anticardiolipin iga antibodies as well as anti2 glycoprotein i iga and igg antibodies 32however as noted by mc gonagle d and coll the increased vascular coagulation occurring in covid-19 patients is more close to a lung centric pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy pic rather than a classical dic 33 this peculiar presentation seems related to mas-like intra-pulmonary inflammation indeed although severe covid-19 has several abnormal laboratory parameters similar to mas the lack of other features such as the classical organomegaly is remarkable leading to suppose a hyper-activation of the immune system mainly confined to the lung parenchyma 33further similarities between hyperferritinemic syndromes and sars-cov-2 severe infection are revealed from the few autopsies on covid-19 patients reported so far macroscopic features in autopsies include pleurisy pericarditis lung consolidation pulmonary edema 34 microscopic findings include diffuse alveolar damage with inflammatory infiltrates composed mainly by monocytes and macrophages but minimal lymphocytes infiltration and multinucleated giant cells alongside large atypical pneumocytes 1135 cardiac involvement in the form of myocarditis has been also described 36 similarly pleurisy pericarditis and myocarditis have been largely described in patients with aosd and mas 3738 some recommendations and guidelines to safely perform an autopsy have been published 39 but the literature on this aspect is still poor even if pathological aspects are of utmost importance to better understand the extent and type of damage associated with covid-19 and its possible pathogenesiswhy some patients with sars-cov-2 infection evolve to a hyper-inflammation state with such a dramatic course while others seem to respond to treatment is still unknown the severity of its evolution does not seem exclusively ascribable to viral factors but probably to host features including different epidemiologic and molecular factors fig 1
 among them the presence of an age and sex preference is evident with a higher occurrence of severe inflammation especially in elderlies and men 40 the different lung expression of the ace2 molecule the receptor used by covid-19 to enter cells could be one of the reasons responsible for a higher prevalence of the severe disease in this specific subset of patients 41 accordingly specific therapies modulating the expression of this receptor such as ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers could be considered an additional external factor providing a major risk for patients co-morbidities represent another risk factor for the development of severe covid-19 systemic inflammation and among them type ii diabetes is one of the mostly described to this regard the increased expression of another receptor named human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 highly expressed in patients with type ii diabetes might be implicated in the worst disease outcome do to the possible ability of sars-cov-2 to infect cells through dpp4 binding as already described in mers-cov infection 42despite the lack of specific data on covid-19 ethnicity might also have some impact on virus infection outcome at birth differences in innate immune response between caucasian and asian people have been identified 43 macrophages derived from healthy filipinos and challenged with m tuberculosis demonstrates a lower production of il-1 and il-6 as well as higher production of il-8 compared to chinese and non-hispanic white people 44 additionally studies on pbmc from children vaccinated for measles demonstrate race-related variation in the amount of cytokine produced following stimulation 45another fascinating hypothesis supporting the differences in covid-19 infection outcome is an antibody-dependent enhancement of sars-cov2 due to previous exposure to other coronavirus 46 indeed previous contact with other coronaviruses responsible for a boost in immune response before covid-19 infection could be accountable for the differences in disease severity observed among peoplewhat is sure right now is that for reasons that still need to be clarified in some covid-19 patients there is an over-inflammatory reaction which strictly reminds the one observed in other inflammatory conditions such as aosd which is a prototype of idiopathic autoinflammatory disorder frequently triggered by infections 47 due to similarities with this condition a genetic predisposition cannot be excluded as well in aosd the presence of rare coding variants in il-1 related pathways 46 and gene polymorphism associated with il-18 49 have been identified at the same extent heterozygous mutations related to prf1 and unc13d genes have been linked to a specific subset of mas patients 50besides genetic factors the modulation of the expression of different cytokines both by lung epithelial cells and by innate and adaptive immune cells needs to be taken into account regarding il-1 it is important to remind that previous studies on sars-cov demonstrated the ability of the virus to up-regulate inflammasome activity with consequent capacity to actively increase the production of il-1 51 due to the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 82 nucleotide sequence homology it is likely that sars-cov-2 displays the same capacity to induce an exaggerated il-1 mediated response thus the link between covid-19 induced inflammatory reaction and hyperferritinemic syndromes such as aosd or mas is immediately evident being both related to a massive il-1 systemic release during mas it is also important to remind the role of type ii interferon ifn which is a crucial mediator of the inflammatory response and whose neutralization looks promising in this condition 52 in this regard although it is known that type i ifn represents the main anti-viral pathway studies on sars-cov revealed that both type i and type ii ifn alpha-beta and gamma synergize to inhibit virus replication with a concomitant active virus attempt to reduce such ifn production 53 preliminary data from covid-19 patients suggest how a suppressed ifn production by cd4 t cells is associated with more severe disease 54 nonetheless in the advanced stages of the disease an over-expression of this molecule may occur due to a second wave of systemic inflammatory reaction similar to mas for this reason a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of concomitant inhibition of il-1 anakinra and ifn emapalumab in severe covid-19 patients has just started nct04324021 however in patients with covid-19 a clear distinction between ards and mas is challenging especially in the first phases of the disease where ards represents the main source of il-6 and l-1 33 results from anakinraemapalumab trial will surely provide interesting insights on this covid-19 associated mas like-syndromebesides il-1 the majority of studies published up to now suggests a predominant role of il-6 in severe covid-19 inflammatory reaction in patients with ards the lung epithelium and immune cell hyper-expression of il-6 is associated with a poor disease outcome 55 as confirmed by a recent study on covid-19 patients 56 however il-6 is also a crucial regulator of the balance among fibroblasts macrophages and epithelial lung cells and is able to participate in the resolution of inflammation 57 thus a prolonged therapeutic blockade of this cytokine and the exact timing to do that needs to be carefully considered 33finally regarding other epidemiological factors possibly able to influence disease outcome the use of concomitant immune modulatingimmune-suppressive therapies is certainly critical 58 interestingly preliminary observations point out that immunosuppressed heart- transplanted patients present a milder form of covid-19 during the later stages when the clinical evolution is mediated by the host inflammatory response 5960 at the moment the italian society of rheumatology has organized a national registry to gather information regarding patients with immune-rheumatologic disease infected by sars-cov-2 and the european league against rheumatism eular has proposed a similar registry too very preliminary results on a large cohort of italian patients with chronic arthritis treated with immunosuppressive agents biologic and targeted synthetic dmards showed no increased risk of respiratory or life-threatening complication from sars-cov-2 infection despite the limited follow-up and the small number of cases that do not allow to draw any conclusion the results could suggest a possible benefit of immune suppression in these patients possibly preventing the onset of uncontrolled systemic inflammation 61 collection and further analysis of such information will be of great interest for the futurein conclusion we believe that covid-19 systemic inflammation is part of the spectrum of hyerferritinemic syndromes a common pathogenic background is probably underlying to these conditions suggesting the use of therapies that target crucial inflammatory mediators to date several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of il-6 inhibition by tocilizumab nct04317092 nct04320615 nct04315480

of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with regard to the present workcovid-19 is an infection of a new coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 2 that emerged in china in late 2019 in the wuhan region and led to a rapid spread worldwide that has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 and now there are more than 4 million cases reportedthe sars-cov2 virus belongs to the coronavirus family a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus 3 in vitro experiments on spike proteins of the virus hypothesized affinity with the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 ace2 4 5 this acts as the gateway to the virus which subsequently distributes through the circulatory stream and triggers a systemic response with hyperinflammation that has been compared to several inflammatory diseases 6 several studies in chinese populations showed that the main predictors of poor prognosis are increased levels of il6 and fibrinogen and systemic inflammation which contributes to mortality 7different studies try to investigate how blocking inflammation can help the treatment of this pathology 8 researchers focused their attention on effector mechanisms however it is important to try to understand the role of the triggers and of innate immunity which acting as a first defense barrier against microorganisms determines the activation of the immune response in some subjects this response seems to be aberrant causing immune-mediated damage in patients even more harmful than the viral damage itself understanding how these mechanisms act may in the future help us to create further approaches for the treatment of this diseasetoll-like receptors tlr are proteins involved in the development and activation of innate immunity it is a family of 11 transmembrane receptor proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps 9 coronavirus seems to trigger a significant cytokine release in the body primarily il-6 and all the other proteins of the acute phase that leads to activation of the immune response 10 the first mechanism of defense of human body from infections is innate immunity in particular the virus is recognized by specific tlr several studies on sars-cov and mers showed the role of tlr3 in the development of a protective response against coronaviruses 11 tlr3 is highly expressed on dendritic cells placenta and pancreas and its activation trough trif tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- pathway determines the activation of irf3 interferon regulatory factor 3 and nf-kb 12 13 fig1in mouse models totura et al demonstrate increasing levels of transcription of tlr3 after coronavirus infections already in the 2nd day post-infection this determines activation of downstream molecules such as trif which determines the activation of transcription factors such as irf3 and nf-kb associated with increased production of type i interferons ifn alpha and beta inflammatory cytokines il-6 tnf and ifn-gamma 11 despite the role in the production of inflammatory cytokines knock-out mice for tlr3 do not have reduced expression of il6 ifn beta tnf and inflammatory cytokines so several pathways linked to tlr signaling can contribute to the production of cytokines which convey downstream on the same inflammatory cascade with consequent amplification 1215on the other side neutralization of adaptor proteins leads to different results the main adaptor proteins involved in tlr pathways in coronavirus infection are trif and myd-88 myeloid differentiation primary response 88 trif is associated with tlr 3 and determines the activation of ifr3 and nk-kb while myd-88 interacts with tlr4 and several proteins involved in il1 function such as irak12 and interleukin 1 il1 receptortrif knock-out mice showed reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the first 2 days after coronavirus infection with a subsequent increase in ifn beta production followed by a marked increase in inflammatory cytokines on day 4 while myd-88 knock-out mice have reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 11the role of tlr 4 also seems to be interesting usually this receptor appears pivotal for the response to the lps of gram-negative bacteria and similar to tlr3 it is associated with activation of transcription factors such as nf-kb and irf3 with an amplification effect of the inflammatory cascade of tlr3 16 17 zhou investigated acute lung damage mediated by respiratory viruses in mouse models these studies showed that laboratory animals infected with sars h1n1 and other lung viruses had pulmonary damage characterized by production of oxidized phospholipids these phospholipids cause the activation of tlr4 similar to bacterial lps which determines activation of myd88 and trif with consequent overproduction of inflammatory cytokines of which il6 represents one of the main determinants of lung damage il6 mice had reduced inflammatory infiltrate and reduced lung damage compared with controls 18these observations together with the evidence of increased il6 levels in patients with covid-19 led to hypothesize on important pathogenic role of il6 consequently blocking il6 modulating levels of this cytokine may represent a possible treatment in severe patients 19 20 tocilizumab tcz a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that has an antagonistic effect on the il-6 receptor used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis could play a key role in the treatment of seriously ill patients with covid-19 21 the first pilot study for the use of tocilizumab enrolled in china 21 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia this study showed that tocilizumab treatment improved body temperature arterial oxygen saturation spo2 reduced c-rp c-reactive protein and reduced oxygen demand 21these preliminary results led to further development of clinical trials on the use of tocilizumab and sarilumab another il6 inhibitor for the treatment of covid-19 these preliminary encouraging data seem promising as may lead to development of therapeutic strategies for the most severe formsother tlrs such as tlr7 and 8 showed implication in coronavirus response normally tlr7 recognizes single-stranded rna in endosomes and recognizes rna of viruses such as coronaviruses hiv and hcv tlr7 is highly expressed in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs and b cells although low levels of this receptor are observed in epithelial cells keratinocytes and hepatocytes tlr7 binds ssrna and activates the myd88 pathway with consequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cascade nf-kb and other pathways this activation increases expression of tnf-alfa il1beta il-6 il12 and ifn-alfatlr8 is expressed in myeloid cells and low levels in pdcs and similar to tlr7 localizes in endosomes rna degradation in endosomes causes his binding with tlr8 with consequent conformational change and activation of myd88 with a downstream pathway similar to tlr7 2225studies on sars-cov another virus of the same family demonstrate how some regions of the viral genome were associated in bioinformatic models with an immunostimulant activity of tnf-a il-6 and il-12 production through tlr7 and 8 almost 2-fold higher than other single-strand rna viruses 26 all these elements together with the interlinking of the different mechanisms of innate immunity lead to an overactivation of the inflammatory response that makes coronavirus induced-pneumonia an immune-mediated diseasethe complement system is a group of proteins present in the bloodstream in a form of inactive precursors involved in mechanisms of protection from bacteria and viruses the complement system acts through three different pathways the classic pathway the alternative pathway and the lectin pathway to activate different elements of the immune system 27the complement system appears to play an important role in coronaviruses infections several studies on other coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers demonstrate that the complement system is not directly involved in the clearance of the viruses as c3 mice do not have different viral levels compared to normal mice however there are more attenuated forms of lung damagein the lungs of mice with a disease similar to sars complement deposits were abundant with inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes neutrophils macrophages and dendritic cells in c3 mice there were no differences in the lymphocytic infiltrate but there were marked differences in neutrophils and macrophages that infiltrate with inflammatory phenotype which were clearly reduced this suggests that their presence could be related to local activation of the complement 28 29 these findings seem important since in several coronavirus-mediated forms of sars neutrophils and macrophages play a pathogenetic role in alveolar damage as their localization correlates with the most damaged sites of lung tissue while lymphocytes appear crucial in post-infectious recovery as t-cells are involved in sars-cov clearance and higher survival in mice and men 30 31recent preliminary data highlight the importance of complement system in patients with covid-19 32 a small study showed the presence of placental complement deposits in 5 cases of pregnant patients with covid-19 with histological evidence of avascular villi and thrombosis in fetal vessels associated with complement deposits 33for these reasons the use of complement system inhibitors for the treatment of covid-19 has started the first drug used was eculizumab a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage to c5a and c5b involved in the generation of membrane attack complex this structure as a result of the activation of the complement system creates transmembrane channels that disrupt cell membranes and lead to cell disruption and death 27 the inhibition of this pathway through eculizumab is a current target for the treatment of various hematological diseases 34first data on the use of eculizumab in covid-19 come from a case series of 4 patients after treatment all patients clinically improved within the first 48 h with a reduction of inflammatory markers both esr and c-rp 35in addition to eculizumab amy-101 a small-sized peptidic c3 inhibitor was used to treat covid-19 pneumonia in a single case this drug is under development for hematological diseases and not yet approved 36 after administration patient clinical conditions rapidly improved after 48 h while leukocytosis and lymphopenia improved more slowly these laboratory markers were associated with improvement of respiratory performance and reduction of oxygen demand 37the commitment of immune cells such as macrophages looks important the first studies on autopsies in patients with covid-19 revealed an extensive immune infiltrate consisting mainly of macrophages and monocytes associated with neutrophils eosinophils and cd4 lymphocytes 38the role of macrophages can be inferred from the immune response observed in other coronavirus infection sars-cov has an accessory protein open read frame 8 orf-8 39 this protein determines the activation of intracellular stress mechanisms lysosomal damage and activation of autophagy specifically at a macrophage level orf-8 causes intracellular aggregates that interact with nlrp3 also called cryopyrin a structural protein of the inflammasome determining its activation 40 the inflammasome is a multiprotein complex part of the innate immune system responsible for the activation of inflammatory response inflammasome activation recruits pro-caspase-1 a proteolytic enzyme that cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as pro-il-1  and pro-il18 thus activating them this leads to a particular form of programmed cell death which is called pyroptosis in which the cell following recognition of intracellular pathogens undergoes programmed cell death associated with discharge of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and subsequent chemotaxis of inflammatory cells in particular the release of il18 stimulates the production of ifn gamma which determines the development of th1 polarization contributing to the development of adaptive immunity 4146 it is plausible that it occurs similarly in sars-cov-2 infection since studies on sars-cov-2 genome prove that there is a high analogy with the sars-cov orf-8 region so we may suppose that macrophage activation of the inflammasome plays an important role determining the important inflammatory response observed in patients with more severe forms of infection 47 48 interleukin 1 release by macrophage through the inflammasome contributes to the cytokine storm responsible for the most aggressive forms of covid-19 with symptoms of hyperactivation of the immune system similar to secondary forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh infection 49 the pathogenetic role of il1 could lead to important therapeutic implications acting on the inflammatory signaling pathway induced by the inflammasome anakinra a recombinant il-1 receptor antagonist could block the cytokine storm similarly to various secondary hlh conditions 50 several case reports evaluated the effectiveness of anakinra in refractory forms of covid-19 pneumonia in a case series of 9 patients treated with subcutaneous anakinra there was only one case of failure while the other 8 had improvement in clinical conditions and reduction of oxygen flow and blood inflammation markers 51 nowadays there are already 13 clinical trials registered on clinicaltrialsgov investigating the efficacy of the inhibitor of il-1-ra anakinra alone or compared with other drugs 52the complete blood count during covid-19 infection is frequently performed and an increase in neutrophils with lymphopenia is observed however the pathogenetic role of this cell population in lung disease level is still unclear 1 from an anatomopathological point of view some case series of patients who died from covid-19 show a marked infiltration of neutrophils in patients lungs 28however data about the pathogenic role of neutrophils can derive from in vivo and in vitro infections from other forms of coronaviruses in mice lung hemorrhagic lesions follow the same distribution of the inflammatory infiltrate by polymorphonuclear cells pmn they also contribute to the healing process through clearance of the virus and production of growth factors involved in healing and re-epithelialization of damaged regions 29 according to channappanavar et al 53 viral infection leading to the expression of viral proteins and local damage at the epithelial cells leads to the pmn cells infiltration pmn cells contribute to local production of cytokines and chemokines in particular the interaction of pmn cells with lung cells amplifies this effect in vitro work demonstrated that pmn cells when they are linked with type i epithelial alveolar cells at1 infected with coronaviruses had an increased expression of mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines il-18 il-1a il-1b and tnf-a cxc chemokines cxcl-1 cxcl-2 ip-10 and cxcl-11 and cc chemokines ccl- 2 ccl-4 ccl-7 ccl-9 ccl-12 and ccl-22 54 so their role would appear dichotomous on the one hand neutrophils can play as actors in the early recruitment of inflammation cells on the other they can contribute to tissue damage when their action does not appear to be adequately counterbalanced 55interferons ifn are a family of signaling proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune responses with an important role in the inhibition of viral replication through different effector proteins 56 57 there are three types of interferons type i interferon   type ii interferon  and type iii interferon  although all three are likely to be involved in protection from coronavirus infection type i ifn is the most studied in this area and his role appears predominant especially in the early stages of the infection 58 the production of type i ifn is enhanced by viral rnas trough two cytosolic proteins rig-1 retinoic acid-inducible gene i and mda5 melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 the recognition of viral rna by these cytosolic receptors leads to the activation of irf3 and determines the initiation of the transcription of type i if thus contributing to resolution of the infection 59the importance of interferon in coronavirus infections was observed in healthy volunteers higgins et al 60 in the 1980s highlighted in a study on 83 healthy volunteers that intranasal administration of recombinant ifn was associated with a protective effect against coronavirus infections in particular it was observed that in the ifn treated group both the severity of the symptoms and the nasal viral load were significantly lower showing a marked protective effect against respiratory coronavirusthe various members of the coronavirus family can inhibit ifn production in different ways sars-cov-2 have several proteins including nsp1 nsp3 nsp16 orf3b orf6 and m and n proteins similar to proteins of other coronaviruses which act on type i ifn pathway either by inhibiting transcription or by acting on effector mechanisms 58 6163 in particular the ability to inhibit the ifn signal varies between different family members more aggressive family members such as mers-cov and sars-cov have a more marked inhibition of interferon activity while human coronavirus hku1 responsible for mild flu infection has mild ifn inhibition thus contributing to the hypothesis of how ifn attenuates viral replication and consequently reduces pathogenicity 64as a demonstration of the importance of the ifn trouillet assant and colleagues evaluated type i ifn immunoprofiling in covid-19 in 26 critically ill patients they observed a peak in ifn 2 production after 810 days of symptoms onset a small group of patients had suppressed ifn-i production in particular patients with no ifn- production presented poorer outcome and longer intensive care unit stay 65this observation has led to different clinical trials comparing the use of ifn in covid-19 disease of these trials one already completed the enrollment phase an investigation into beneficial effects of interferon beta 1a compared to interferon beta 1b and the base therapeutic regiment in moderate to severe covid-19 a randomized clinical trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04343768 and others are still enrolling clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04320238 nct04350671 nct04343976 nct04254874 66 also protective role of ifn is explored in a clinical trial nct04320238 developed to evaluate the effect of intranasal administration of ifn -1b alone or in combination with thymosin- subcutaneous in doctors at high risk of infection 6668slowly we are increasing our knowledge on covid-19 however further studies are still needed to understand its pathophysiological and epidemiological aspects many notions that we have come from in vitro experiments or from other coronaviruses 47 48 currently there is still a lack of elements that allow us to predict adequately between the asymptomatic forms and the systemic form with severe lung damage the hyperactivation of the immune system contributes significantly to the lung and systemic damage that can lead to patients death 62 63 innate immunity acting as the first element of defense can represent together with other mechanisms a promising target for the treatment of patients or at least to better understand the pathogenesis of the diseaseemerging and a sudden pathogen outbreak has always been a challenge in public health and the economic sectors worldwide coronaviruses belong to coronoviridae family and order nidovirales which has none segmented positive-sense rna 1 and are widely found in birds humans and other mammals six species are most common in human in which nl63 hku1 oc43 and 229e causes common cold symptoms while two other strain including middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov reported in the middle east in 2012 2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov observed in 2003 in guangdong province china are zoonotic and are highly pathogenic resulting in fatal diseases in humans 3 in december 2019 china faced another destructing sars-cov-2 outbreak leading to major health issues the first cases with unknown etiology were reported at the end of december 2019 from wuhan hubei china 4 the causative agent was announced by chinese authority in the first week of january 2020 as a novel coronavirus 2019 a first viral genome sequence was issued on 10 january 2020 5 followed by submission of the other four genomic sequences confirmed the indicating association of the virus with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 6 in the light of available evidence sars-cov-2 is considered to be transmitted from wild animals with the most possible from bats directly or maybe via other intermediate animals confirmation of clear source s will help to identify the pattern of transmission 7 rhinolophus bat is mostly suspected which is found in south china and also in other asian countries in abundance this evidence is supported by studies found 500 covs identification in bats in china 8 bats are exceptional food available in a few chinese restaurants and local markets after the primary transmission the rapid rate of infection spread due to direct transmission from humans to humans in families health care centers and public contact areas 9 signs and symptoms of covid-19 patients include dry cough fatigue fever dyspnea runny nose and in some cases nasal congestion but fever is still considered to be a typical symptom 10 in such sudden outbreaks diagnostic challenges always remain a problem before proceeding to treatment initially biochemical tests from respiratory biological samples bronchial aspirates sputum bronchoalveolar lavage fluid nasal and pharyngeal swabs are helpful to differentiate and specifically identify particular viruses including influenza parainfluenza virus mers-cov sars-cov adenovirus avian influenza 11 molecular techniques in comparison with biochemical tests are found the most accurate and successful ways in pathogen identification to confirm sars-cov-2 through real-time rt-pcr is importantly recommend and used several other advanced technologies like metagenomic next-generation sequencing mngs is also implemented to rapid diagnosis of covid-19 12 these approaches not only help medical experts to study the entire infectome ie bacteria rna virus or dna virus within the infected organism but are also important routes toward disease prevention and treatment 13 at the time of writing this review article no effective vaccine or drugs are available for the treatment of covid-19 worldwide scientific communities are working die-hard to contribute in outbreak control some of them under trail dugs and immune modulators are previously published shown in table 1 14to overcome the further spread of sars-cov-2 precautions and preventions are highly recommended ie to restrict traveling to affected areas direct personnel exposure to a diseased individual use of disinfectants in routine and least exposure of human to human since no completely effective treatment is available for covid-19 but in this regard china has approximately two thousand old histories of using traditional chinese medicines tcm against most of the viral infections including large-scale cold outbreaks being effective since zhong-jin zhang ad150- 219 15 so tcm could be a better hope in the recent outbreak as well as in future such epidemics a generic drug screening and selection process are shown in fig 1 few examples relevant to respiratory viral infections eg yin-qiao-san and jing-fang-bai-du-san dispelling wind and cold ma-xing-shi-gan-tang can remove toxic heat obstruction in the lungs so has been effective in past 16 further investigation and research in tcm can also contribute in providing therapies for covid-19 tcm is not only effective indirect inhibition of virus attachment and internalization in cell thus prevent their replication and further spread but also boost up host immune response 17 and can enhance t cell proliferation antibody production expression of pathogen-specific cd8   and cd4  response the release of iga igg2 and igg1 increase th1 type cytokine secretion activation of alveolar macrophages suppress th2th17-responses and keep th1 and th2th17 cells balanced thus preventing further severity 18 from the available reports sars-cov-2 outbreak has infected thousands of individuals with high mortality rate due to unavailability of effective therapies with this in mind we aimed to summarize some important therapeutic strategies to enhance host immune response with the help of traditional chinese medicine which are observed quite effective against viral epidemics in past before effective vaccines were developed for the complete virus elimination so the implementation could be a hopeful contribution in covid-19 therapeutic strategiestcm is composed of many antiviral active components including alkaloids flavonoids glycosides volatile oil phenols etc polyphylla saponin-i has antiviral effects on the influenza a virus 20 ginsenosides has a protective effect on the lethal infection of a hemagglutinating virus of japan hvj as well as has antiviral activity on the hepatitis a virus coxsackievirus b3 enterovirus 71 and human rhinovirus 3 21 ginsenoside rg3 attenuates hepatitis b virus dna replication through the degradation of traf6tak1 and the inhibition of jnkap-1 signaling 22 and rg3 inhibits hepatitis c virus hcv infection via restoring the hcv-induced dynamin-related protein 1-mediated aberrant mitochondrial dynamics 23 glycyrrhizic acid is effective against infection of coxsackievirus a16 and enterovirus 71 while glycyrrhizin has an inhibition effect on the replication of the sars-associated virus 24 radix glycyrrhizae restricts infection of the human respiratory syncytial virus through preventing viral attachment internalization and by stimulating the secretion of ifn 25 flavonoids are a class of ingredients with good anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities and widely found in varieties of tcm and natural medicine houttuynia cordata is a traditionally used medicinal plant for the treatment of pneumonia and flavonoids are one of the main antiviral bioactive constituents including quercetin and isoquercetin houttuynia cordata thunb hct blocks hsv infection through inhibition of nf-b activation 26 hct water extract exhibited significant inhibitory effects on sars-cov and regulates immunity through stimulating the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes increases the proportion of cd4 and cd8 t cells and the secretion of il-2 and il-10 27 hct alleviates h1n1-induced acute lung injury in mice by inhibition of influenza neuraminidase activity and toll-like receptor signaling baicalin a flavonoid inhibits the influenza virus by modulating ns1-mediated cellular innate immune responses 28 baicalein triazole inhibits respiratory syncytial virus rsv -infection and prevents pulmonary airway inflammation through the activation of the ifn signaling pathway moslae herba flavonoids attenuate iav-induced barrier dysfunction by inhibiting nox4nf-bmlck pathway 29the positive role of tcm has been emphasized in the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia trail version 6 and some chinese patent medicines are recommended to treat covid-19 xuebijing injection xbji is a chinese patent medicine that was approved for the treatment of sepsis in china 30 xbji shows a protective effect in patients with severe pneumonia which mainly inhibits the activation of the tlr4-nf-b pathway and decreases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-6 il-8 and il-17 etc 31 xbji also can improve the coagulation function to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress damage and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis xbji significantly improves the primary endpoint of the pneumonia severity index in critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia 32 xiyanping injection approval id 2010-03 xypi the major bioactive ingredient is sulfonated andrographolide has a significant effect on acute viral infection of the respiratory system foot and mouth disease mycoplasmal pneumonia in children 33 shenfu injection sfi reduces the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine of il-6 il-8 and tnf- while increases the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels of il-4 and il-10 sfi reinforces immunity function by regulating the expression of complements and cytokines levels 34 a study has shown that sfi alleviates acute lung injury and improves the survival rate by suppressing the hmgb1-nf-b pathway in a rat model of endotoxin shock thus preventing cytokine storm 35 xingnaojing injection xnji flavonoids are its main components improves cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury through inhibiting the inflammatory response by the sirt1 pathway and regulating oxidative stress 36interferon ifns induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes isgs for defense against numerous viral infections ifns have been classified into three major subfamilies type i ifns comprising mainly ifn- and ifn- type ii ifns ifn- and the recently identified type iii ifns ifn- type i interferonst1-ifnhave immune defense effect on many viral infections 41 and are a critical effector of the innate immune response following virus infection ifn- is a pluripotent inflammatory cytokine typically induced by viral infections ifn- is produced by leukocytes while ifn- is a fibroblast product ifn- suppresses classical swine fever virus csfv replication through interferon stimulated gene 15 isg15 mediated beclin-1 becn1 isgylation and autophagy inhibition 42 ifn- inhibits acute iav replication and controls the excessive immunopathology caused by iav a recent study showed that ifn- and ifn- both have protective effects during acute chikungunya virus chikv infection but the mechanisms are different ifn- inhibits chikv replication whereas ifn- prevents chikv pathogenesis by alleviating inflammation induced by neutrophils 43 ifn- as type ii interferons are released by activated t cells natural killer cells nk cells and nkt cells ifn- plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immunity ifn- is a hallmark cytokine of type i helper t cells th1 cells which have antivirus immune regulation and antitumor properties type iii ifn or ifn- is mainly as an epithelial cytokine which inhibits viral replication in epithelial cells and has a protective effect on mucosal sites 44 ifn- exhibits biological characteristics signal transducer and effector functions similar to t1-ifn ifn- also acts directly or indirectly on nk cells to potentiate their activation and protect against viruses studies have shown that ifn- controls multiple gut viruses and is a potent innate immune regulator of intestinal viral infections such as rotavirus reovirus norovirus enterovirus parvovirus and coronavirus 45 ifn- restricts influenza a virus iav replication and alleviates infectioninduced morbidity while prevents the potential inflammatory complications associated with ifn 46 ifn- also suppresses the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in both lung and gastrointestinal tracts ifn-3 has anti-hbv activities and immune-modulatory effects to restrict hbv replication preclinical studies show that ifn- effectively inhibits hcv replication and has fewer side effects than ifn- due to its more restricted receptor distribution 47 while treating the inflammatory diseases biological agents are effective sources but they have some limitations which includes the loss of response and cost also they may have large number of side effects in patients here an example is that many patients do not tolerate chimeric antibodies because of the hypersensitivity reactions to the agents which are non-human components there is another issue regarding immunosuppression which results in increasing the microorganisms infections so in patients the latent infections may reactivate such as tuberculosis hepatitis b and pnuemocystis pneumonia as these agents should be administrated subcutaneously or intravenously so there is also an issue regarding their administration because of the reaction of the site of injection 48interleukin is a family of cytokines with bidirectional immune-modulatory effects mainly involved in the differentiation and activation of immune cells il-12 family as inflammatory factors includes il-12 il-23 il-27 il-35 and il-39 il-12 is a key immune-regulatory cytokine which bridges nonspecific innate resistance and antigen-specific adaptive immunity 49 il-12 plays a crucial role in type 1 immunity which induces many cytokines and inflammatory responses il-12 has a protective effect and increases the resistance to infection in herpes simplex virus type 1hsv-1-thermally injured mice il-12 could down-regulate pd-1 and increase cd8 functionality for immunity in persistent hbv infections 50 il-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as il-12 which promotes the proliferation of t cells and memory t cells and the production of ifn- il-23 enhances ifn- responsiveness to promote hcv eradication il-23 promotes host resistance vaccinia virus infection via the il-23il-17 axis il-23 produced by myeloid dendritic cells induces socs1 expression and causes t cell dysfunction during hiv infection 51 il-27 is secreted by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells dcs which has a dual role in immune regulation 52 as an anti-inflammatory role il-27 could induce il-10 producing tr1 cells capable of inhibiting th1 and th17 type responses but also as a pro-inflammatory cytokine to break down cd4 tregs or by activating th1 differentiation 53 il-27 has broad anti-viral effects such as hiv-1 hcv herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv-1 and hbv but the mechanism differs il-27 could prevent macrophages from hiv-1 infection by down-regulating spectrin  none-erythrocyte 1 sptbn1 il-27 is capable to suppress hcv replication by inducing the activation of stat-1 and it can also control hsv-1 infection via the up-regulation of stat-1 il-6 and ip-10 and mig 54 il-35 a newly identified member of the il-12 family suppresses immunity by regulatory t and b cells and plays an important role in the immune tolerance period of viral infection il-35 induces immune-tolerance through suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression during chronic hbv infection 55 il-35 contributes to prevent hcv-induced liver damage via reducing inflammatory responses while play a contradictory role in persistent hcv infection by the inhibition of antiviral immune activity il-35 is the high expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and throat swabs of patients with seasonal iav which inhibits iav rna replication and viral protein synthesis by induction of type i and iii ifn 56 overall il-35 plays a critical role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases but the functions of il-35 in antiviral infections are not yet well understood il-15 is critical for the development and function of natural killer nk nkt and memory cd8 t cells il-15 has innate antiviral activity and is an activator of nk cell-mediated antiviral defense 57 il-15 could enhance the killing ability of nk cells while contributing to the synthesis and secretion of ifn therefore il-15 potentially stimulates nk cells from hiv-positive donors and improves nk cells antiviral effects to clear hiv-1-infected cells il-15 efficiently enhances the survival and effector function of hiv-specific cd8 t cells which may improve their activity to control hiv 58 il-15 is up-regulated during primary human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection which renders primary human cd4 cells more susceptible to hiv il-15 and ifn- restraints hcv replication via the erk pathway 59 synergistic effects of il-15 and ifn- significantly enhance the cd8 t cell response in a state of immune hypo-responsiveness il-22 is a member of the il-10 family of cytokines it has been documented that il-22 has a crucial role in many virus infections including hbv rotavirus hiv influenza virus dengue virus and hsv-2 60 il-22 induces the proliferation of liver stemprogenitor cells via activating stat3 and reduces pathology in mice and patients with chronic hbv infection il-22 could enhance the expression of the interferon-stimulated gene isg and limit rotavirus replication by cooperating with ifn- 61 after the influenza virus infection il-22 promotes epithelial cell regeneration while prevents lung inflammation and secondary bacterial infection il-22 could reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the accumulation of neutrophil to restrict dengue virus-induced hepatic damage and inflammation 62 studies have indicated that il-22 has the ability to antiviral by the activation of the jakstat signaling pathway 63antibodies are the key biological molecules of the immune system effective in minimizing viral pathogenesis because of their specificity to host protein monoclonal antibodies are much specific in their activities and have been tested against fatal pathogenic viruses like cytomegalovirus ebola hiv-1 and influenza and approximately in the last two decades 60 recombinant antibodies have been developed 70 another study has shown that rbd-43e4 and rbd-14f8 chimeric antibodies have an effective role in neutralizing mers-cov similarly monoclonal antibodies were characterized and produced against the spike protein of mers-cov celisa was developed using one of those monoclonal antibodies celisa was then used to detect the specific antibodies of mers-cov in the sera from infected rats and rabbits which were immunized with the spike protein of mers-cov 71 while the combination of two human monoclonal antibodies cr3022 and cr3014 are effective in case of sars-cov and also these two antibodies can extend protection 72 when the spike proteins conserved region binds with the human monoclonal antibodies it is very appropriate for generating therapeutic antibodies and also for the protection against a large number of sars-cov variants similar to influenza hiv and rsv sars-cov-2 also has trimeric spikes protein tsp on the envelope sars-cov-2 trimeric spikes protein tends to bind ace2 of the host cell receptor and facilitate viral entry by targeting tsp effective neutralizing antibodies could be effective to inhibit viral attachment to host cells cr3022 is a sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody and its epitope does not overlap with ace2 binding site within sars-cov-2 rbd and could have the potential to bind with sars-cov-2 rbd as illustrated in fig 3 therefore this alone or with the combination of other neutralizing antibodies could be a therapeutic candidate for sars-cov-2 mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are all strains of coronaviruses so following the same pattern with some required modification could be helpful in antibodies development for complete neutralization of sars-cov-2 in human there are some limitations based on the function of the therapeutic antibodies including the tissue accessibility insufficient pharmacokinetics and also the reduced interactions with the immune system because of these limitations there is a need of more research on these antibodies 73antiviral peptides have a strong potential as a therapeutic drug for infection prevention a single peptide can be verified for broad-spectrum antiviral activity the first known example of a cationic peptide is -defensin having antiviral activity against cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus while human neutrophil peptide 1 hnp1 with the in vitro significant effects against vesicular stomatitis virus due to high viral mutation probability traditional vaccines are limited in certain epidemics in such scenario vaccination strategies based on antibody-mediated protection can stop virus infection but high mutation rates make escape virus for host infection therefore classical antibody-based vaccines are proven weak in inducing t cell response the inclusion of small peptides that could be presented by mhc molecules to t cells can produce antigen-specific responses 74 by following this concept a multi epitope peptide vaccine has been found effective against sars-cov-2 by a potential triggering of cd4 and cd8 t cell immune response 75 peptides based antiviral strategies may work in different aspects like entry blocker peptide helps in the prevention of viral fusion to host cells virucidal peptides act upon virus envelope and disrupt the structure and viral replication inhibitors can block further division 76 a major significance of peptides based therapy is that there are fewer chances of resistance development on the other hand sars-cov-2 spike rbd is different from sars-cov spike rbd which supports the use of existing therapeutic peptides for the sars-cov spike rbd against sars-cov-2 77 but peptides based therapy has some limitations like low oral bioavailability and shorter half-life peptide hydrophilicity has poor permeability through physiological barriers and biological membranes rapid digestion by proteolytic enzymes of the digestive system and blood plasma as well as rapid clearance from the circulation within few minutes by the liver and kidneys poor specific bio-distribution due to high conformational flexibility high production costs of synthetic peptides therapeutic peptides and proteins also tend to undergo denaturation aggregation and adsorption which limit their active concentration and proper function in vivo 78host-based antiviral therapies include enhancement of interferon responses targeting host factors and host signaling pathways facilitating virus replication these approaches are significant to reduce inflammation severity and also keep immune reactions balanced to act against pathogens effectively both adaptive or innate immune responses can be targeted by these approaches 79 after the complete structural and molecular composition is fully explored several pre-existing or newly identified immune-modulatory agents with the combination of an effective antiviral may be a potential therapeutic option against covid-19 here we have summarized some of the important compounds related to host immune-based antiviral therapy which could be indicated helpful if used with or without modification against covid-19 after investigation mesalazine and celecoxib are cox inhibitors having wide-ranging clinical applications for having analgesic anti-inflammatory and antipyretic characteristics but many studies have found the application of these inhibitors celecoxib and mesalazine in combination with zalamivir are more effective in reducing cytokineschemokines levels and mortality in mice but due limited existing knowledge in present these are not recommended in severe respiratory viral infections caused by sars-cov-2 80 on the hand corticosteroids are steroid hormones bind with cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptor which is involved in regulating anti-inflammatory genes transcription mechanism therefore could be used in anti-inflammatory treatment as experienced in h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 resulting in treatment of 40 infected individuals having acute respiratory distress syndrome in france while 622 h7n9 avian influenza-infected patients were treated with corticosteroid in china during 2013 81 in case of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections cytokines are highly induced causing lung injury due to inflammation in such patients corticosteroids were used frequently for viral clearance but have found to be not significantly effective in controlling mortality therefore more investigation is needed to confirm the harm or benefit of systematic corticosteroid based covid-19 treatment 11 reactive oxygen species ros also have a role in viral replication and inflammatory responses thus antioxidants having anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities could be also tested to treat cytokine storm antioxidants monotherapy has limited effects on cytokine storm so the combination with antiviral is still needed to be studied 82 increased oxidative stress because of rapid free radicals release use of antioxidants like vitamin c can play a role in covid-19 management 83 a high level of angiotensin ii in sars-cov-2 patients is related with lung injury and viral pathogenesis so several angiotensin receptor blockers could have potential again sars-cov-2 84 statin is an angiotensin receptor blockers arbs is proposed to be an immune modulator agent for reducing inflammatory responses and is also an inhibitor for 3 hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg-coa reductase exerting immune effector cells by ros inhibition and can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in some viruses statin in combination with caffeine is more effective in viral replication inhibition and alleviation of lung injury and has a similar activity like ribavirin and oseltamivir 85 since we have no report found that shows the role of ox40 cd134 against sars-cov-2 ox40 cd134 can play a major role in t-cell-mediated immunotherapy against viral infection in the lungs through up-regulating anti-apoptotic gene expression 86 along with anti-pathogenic actions some antiviral and antibiotics also possess immune-modulatory properties and anti-inflammatory activities eg macrolides reduced viral replication and reduced inflammatory cell number 87 arbidol is also an antiviral agent which might also be effective in the treatment of severe viral infection and reducing inflammation by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is approved in russia and china for their inhibitory effects on sars-cov-2 88 interestingly in tcm plant extracts from jiawei-yupingfeng-tang can also have a big contribution against viral infection by modulating immune effects and can alleviate viral-induced lung lesions with both antiviral and immune-modulatory activity 89 pseudomonas aeruginosa injection pa-msha is a kind of biological agents for immunotherapy which exhibits a broad immune-modulatory effect and is used for adjuvant treatment of malignant tumors in clinical studies have demonstrated that pa-msha promotes dcs maturation and enhances t-cell activation pa-msha also as an adjuvant activates natural immunity by the toll-like receptor tlr pathway and improves hiv-1 dna vaccine immune response 90 sars-cov-2 infection in severe and critical stage can cause viral sepsis in addition pa-msha effectively inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory factors reduces inflammatory response and tissue injury and lowers the rate of infection complications in sepsis pa-msha also can reverse the drug resistance 91 therefore pa-msha may play a role in regulating immune response and inflammation in covid-19because of the recent epidemics of sars-cov-2 all over the world it leads to a huge loss in health and economic sectors in past two such epidemics of respiratory complications were observed with the other two strains of coronavirus termed as mers-cov and sars-cov in all such outbreaks initially symptom treatment is focused to be clinically managed in existing ill patients as well as further spread of the fatal pathogen globally public health authorities are mainly focused on quarantine affected individuals restrict travelers from epicenters disease control measures transmission and prevention to overcome further mortality until the development of complete effective medications for covid-19 no doubt these are effective ways in disease management but this is not a long term possible way to control sars-cov-2 further spread due to everyday interactions in public especially china with a high population rate in the world recently along with many other ongoing clinical trials in the field of tcm three chinese patent drugs jinhua qinggan granules approval number of state food and drug administration of china sfda z20160001 lianhua qingwen granules sfda approval number z20100040 and xuebijing injection sfda approval number z20040033 have been approved by the national medical products administration of china and have proved inclusion for the treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia which has become the worlds first batch of drugs suitable for covid-19 92 93 similarly another concluded that the treatment of covid-19 patients with either arbidol 200 mg tid nebulized ifn-2b 5 mu bid or a combination of arbidol plus ifn-2b ifn-2b with or without arbidol can effectively decrease the duration of the virus in the upper respiratory tract and also decrease the duration of the high blood levels for the crp and inflammatory markers il6 94 in outbreaks of h5n1 ebola and sars effective neutralizing antibodies have been generated for passive immunotherapy with satisfactory results so this technique has importance in the treatment of covid-19 a major role in the development of passive immunotherapy with plasma has been experienced with ensured hyperimmune immunoglobulins or monoclonal antibodies 95 in the current outbreak convalescent plasma therapy in uncontrolled studies in china indeed indicated a beneficial treatment for patients on mechanical ventilation 96 the same technique of passive immunotherapy is also been practiced in many other countries based on the therapeutic options mentioned in this review several tcm containing bioactive compounds can target structural components and directly inhibit attachment penetration and replication as well as can counteract through stimulation of t cells antiviral cytokines and production of antigen-specific antibodies for the elimination of sars-cov-2 already some other agents like fusion peptide ek1 97 anti-inflammatory drugs hormones and other molecules rna synthesis inhibitors such as tdf 3tc and abidol 98 are effective in vitro therefore more clinical investigation has to confirm its efficacy and safety against sars-cov-2 and meanwhile some drug options could be adopted from past treatment experience of sars and mers however the application of tcm in covid-19 needs to be studied both in vivo and in vitro to identify exact anti-sars-cov-2 compounds mechanism of action antiviral efficacy potential synergistic effects and immune-stimulatory effects to prioritize and select a drug for a potential application in the ongoing covid-19 outbreaksince its first detection in wuhan china december 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has had a dramatic worldwide diffusion 1 accordingly the world health organization who declared a pandemic on 11 march 2020 the clinical severity spectrum of sars-cov-2 may range from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sometimes leading to multi organ failure mof more recently new insights concerning the disease course are emerging some patients are initially characterized by dyspnea and hypoxemia which can rapidly progress to a mild respiratory syndrome needing o2 therapy in contrast other patients rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sometimes evolving in septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation dic and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods thus covid-19 has emerged as a multifaceted multi-system multi-organ disorder which produces its pathogenic effects through a quite ubiquitous target at the level of multiple organs notably all age groups are susceptible to the virus and elderly patients with comorbidities are more likely to experience a severe illness as of 29 may 2020 over 5800000 confirmed cases have caused more than 360000 deaths 2scientific research efforts are focused on producing a vaccine quickly because it would be the best way to halt the pandemic however despite several groups working on it it is difficult to guarantee the marketing of a safe product in a short time other efforts are actually trying to understand the pathogenesis of covid-19 which would be extremely useful to identify a specific and more efficient therapy although there is no clear clinical evidence for effective antiviral drugs several antivirals targeting the molecular pathways of sar-cov-2 have been used worldwide 3 but only remdesivir has shown to be effective in shortening the time to recovery of hospitalized covid-19 patients 4 also a short-term use of corticosteroids to inhibit the cytokine cascade and to prevent disease progression toward a severe form could be considered for patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia 5 the widely used treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine often in association with macrolides has shown mixed benefits in the available studies and may even be harmful according to some authors due to cardiac toxicity 67 taking into account these results the who firstly suspended the studies launched on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 8 nevertheless there would seem to be a need for general clarification indeed since several concerns were raised with respect to data and analyses performed at the moment we are proofreading our manuscript the article was retracted and the who resumed the studies concerning chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in reason of a disproportionate and aberrant immune response able to drive covid-19 to the related ards and in some patients to fibrosis and widespread lung damage tocilizumab a humanized anti-interleukin-6-receptor il-6r monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-6 il-6 signaling is currently under investigation in several clinical trials 9 preliminary data have created interest in anti-cytokine therapy to counteract the inappropriate immune responses as a beneficial therapeutic strategy and accordingly the italian drug agency aifa agenzia italiana del farmaco has also recently approved a clinical trial sobiimmuno-101 in which a combination of emapalumab a monoclonal antibody toward ifn- and anakinra a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist will be synergistically administrated to covid-19 patients with the hope to induce a rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvementbesides a pharmacological therapy many people during this period are wondering if some non-pharmacological substances used to strengthen their defenses against common winter infections can be useful the pharmacological properties of natural compounds have gained increasing attention in the field of alternative and coadjutant therapeutic approaches to several diseases accordingly the food industry is focused on bioactive substances contained in foods or natural products termed nutraceuticals which can bring health benefits besides their intrinsic nutritional values especially in the treatment of chronic diseases moreover these compounds are characterized by negligible side effects in comparison with traditional pharmacological therapies so that consumers lean towards their use for health promotion regarding the usefulness of non-pharmacological substances no specific clinical studies for sars-cov-2 infection are available yet however we will review the possible role of probiotics nutraceuticals and diet supplementation in sars-cov-2 viral infection this scoping review was designed in keeping with the best reviewing practices specifically we searched pubmed for articles on diet supplementation probiotics or nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of sars-cov-2 infection or covid-19 specifically the following string was last run on 16 april 2020 sars-cov-2 or covid-19 or coronavirus-associated disease 2019 and probiotic or nutraceutic or diet or supplement studies were selected if reporting on original in vitro in vivo or human studies and key study subjects interventions and outcomes were systematically collected all reviewing tasks were performed by two independent reviewers m mancone and p severino with divergences solved after consensussince the first us case of covid-19 showing atypical symptoms diarrhea and other gastrointestinal gi manifestations have attracted more attention in the scientific community 10 sars-cov-2 infects human cells through the binding of its spike proteins s to angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 ace2 11 ace2 is highly expressed in at2 lung cells but also in esophagus epithelial cells and enterocytes in the ileum and colon 12 tmprss2 a protein responsible for the priming of the viral s protein necessary for entry into the host cell is also highly expressed in absorbent enterocytes 13sars-cov-2 rna has been detected in the stool of covid-19 patients 1014 a histological study by fei xiao et al performed on the intestinal mucosa of a patient with stool positivity reported infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes with interstitial edema in the epithelium of stomach duodenum and rectum furthermore the presence of the viral host receptor ace2 was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal epithelial cells while the viral nucleocapsid protein was visualized in the cytoplasm of rectum duodenal and gastric epithelial cells 15in this last study gi colonization appeared to be tardive with respect to respiratory infection and in more than 20 of infected patients viral rna was present in stool even after negativization in the respiratory tract however this partially contrasts with the report of wang et al that showed how the less common gi symptoms like diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal discomfort had an early and mild onset compared to the respiratory symptoms 16similar evidence from studies on the 2003 first sars coronavirus epidemic indicated gastrointestinal tropism since the virus was found in gastrointestinal biopsies and stool even in healed patients which may partially justify the intestinal symptoms reappearance and transmission of the disease 17an experimental study on mutant mice with ace2 deficiency demonstrated the role of this receptor in the regulation of innate immunity preservation of the gut microbiome regulation of the intestinal amino acid balance and production of antimicrobial peptides these functions were independent from the renin angiotensin system and transplantation of the altered microbiota from ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts could increase the propensity for serious colitis 18therefore most of the data suggest that sars-cov-2 is more likely transmitted via the respiratory route but many findings suggest that the intestine could have a relevant role both in the disease pathogenetic evolution and as a possible route of infection based on the intestinal findings it is possible to assume that viral replication in the intestine determines an exponential increase in the viral load in the digestive mucosa this mechanism could lead to a loss of barrier integrity with an imbalance of the microbial flora and its metabolites determining important consequences on the immune system which could lead to a strong production of cytokines this may in part justify the appearance of ards and mof following interstitial pneumonia figure 1classically viral infections have been considered a bidirectional process involving exclusively the host cell and the virus with no participating external factors other than the host immune system in the last decade thanks to the wide knowledge provided by metagenomic analysis viral infections like many other medical occurrences have been associated with the so-called microbiota revolution which is the tendency to link many pathologic conditions to the intestinal microbiota and its alteration the term microbiota refers to the complex community of microorganisms that stably colonize the mucosal surfaces of the human body such microbes constitute a key factor in health and disease because of their essential metabolic and immunomodulatory functions as well as for their protection against pathogens 192021 particularly commensal bacteria have resulted to play an essential role in shaping the host immune systems as well as in triggering its responses in both health and disease conditions 2223 the presence of an intimate relationship between the host immune system and the microbiota has been primarily evidenced in the gastrointestinal tract by the determination in germ-free mice of many immunological defects such as small peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes reduced amount of t helper 17 th17 cells and deficiency in regulatory t cells 24 these defects reverse within weeks after the acquisition of intestinal bacteria from normally colonized mice 25 further evidence has shown that the gastrointestinal tract microbiota is able to modulate neutrophils migration and function 26 as well as to influence the differentiation of t cells into th1 th2 th17 helper cells or t regulatory treg cells 27 which may be linked in turn to tolerance or immune reactions against different luminal bacteria compared to the study of the intestinal microbiota that of the lung microbiota is still at the beginning but some observations support the role played by commensal bacteria in the lung in immune tolerance maintained by subpopulations of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells 28 such cell types by inducing the generation of tregs 29 and releasing prostaglandin e2 pge2 tumor growth factor-beta tgf- and interleukin-10 il-10 28 exert immunomodulatory functionsin murine models the presence of specific bacterial taxa as well as a general increase of bacterial biomass in the lungs has been associated with the development of treg cells two weeks after birth 30 while the introduction of commensal bacteria in germ-free mice has been shown to reduce the strong immune response induced by the intranasal administration of ovalbumin ova 31 in human lungs bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes have been associated with the decrease of lung inflammation 32 while the bacterial genera prevotella and veillonella have been implicated in th17 cell-mediated immune responses 33a synergistic interplay between the microbiota and the human host occurs when the microbial communities are characterized by a balanced state known as eubiosis perturbations of such a condition called dysbiosis could lead to the loss andor the dysregulation of the normal functions provided by the microbiota and constitute a pivotal driver for both infectious and non-infectious diseases 34 to date a wide range of local and systemic diseases comprising inflammatory bowel disease obesity allergic disorders atopic dermatitis autism colorectal cancer and diseases affecting both the higher and the lower respiratory tracts have been associated with microbial dysbiosis 3536373839 in particular in recent years the interaction between the intestine and the respiratory system both for homeostasis maintenance and in disease pathways has been individuated and the term gutlung axis was coined to refer to this mutual interaction 40although dysbiosis is often characterized by a multifactorial etiology one of its main causes is represented by infections carried out by invading pathogens most commonly by viruses studies investigating the interaction between viruses and the microbiota have shown that commensal bacteria through different mechanisms are able to regulate or are regulated by invading viruses thereby leading to harmful or beneficial effects on the host 4142434445 consensus has been reached that viral infections including those sustained by influenza viruses alter the commensal microbiota in both the gastrointestinal and the airway tracts of the host causing alterations of the microbiotahost relationship which is a key element in determining infection-related disease different studies have evidenced that in the upper respiratory tract the influenza virus infection is associated with decreased colonization by health-promoting bacteria as well as with enrichment in potentially harmful microbes for example it has been reported that the nasopharyngeal microbiota of patients with viral respiratory tract infections is significantly enriched in bacterial pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis 46 while the colonization of the health-associated genus prevotella results to be decreased 4647 although contradictory findings are reported in the current literature for the gut microbiota resulting from differences in experimental conditions concerning virus subtypes and doses experimental animal models age diet and lifestyle of the investigated subjects a general decrease in the richness of bacteria belonging to the phylum firmicutes mainly lactobacilli has been associated with viral infections and in particular with influenza viruses 484950 one of the postulated mechanisms leading to influenza-associated commensal microbiota dysregulation involves the altered delivery of ifn- a type ii ifn by a subset of lung-derived t cells expressing cc chemokine receptor 9 in the intestine and the subsequent stimulation of epithelial cells to produce il-15 which induces a th17-mediated immune response 51 although no direct evidence is currently available about the association between sars-cov-2 infections and microbial dysbiosis in both the gut and the respiratory tract the presence of symptoms like diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal discomfort as well as the determined tropism of sars-cov-2 for enterocytes 141552 suggests that interactions between this new -coronavirus and the gut microbiota are possibleto date while effective therapies or vaccines to prevent and fight respiratory virus infections are available for influenza and adenoviruses no effective therapies are available for other respiratory viruses such as those responsible for common cold and the new -coronavirus sars-cov-2 the need to rapidly contrast respiratory viral infections together with the large amount of time and money necessary for the development of vaccines challenge the development of alternative and safe therapies able to reduce the risk of such infections in this context the use of probiotics could represent a promising tool in the field of clinical research probiotics consist of alive organisms that when administered in sufficient amounts confer positive benefits to patients and their potential clinical utilization has been proposed in numerous pathologic conditions 53 although solid evidence is still lacking many experimental and clinical studies support the possible role of different probiotic microorganisms in protecting the host against viral infections comprising those responsible for colds and flu 545556575859a recent cochrane meta-analysis including 12 randomized controlled trials rct with a total of 3720 subjects demonstrated that probiotics were able to reduce the number of acute upper respiratory tract infections the mean duration of disease antibiotic administration and cold-related school absences compared to a placebo although the quality of evidence was low 60the exact mechanisms of the antiviral activity of probiotics is not completely clear and it likely involves multiple concomitant steps in particular the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic bacteria against viral infections could be exerted at three different levels implicating a direct interaction with the virus 1 by reinforcing the mucosal innate immune response 2 by reducing intestinal permeability and 3 by affecting the systemic acquired immune response through a regulatory and anti-inflammatory effectvirus attachment to a host cell represent an essential step in viral infection so probiotic bacteria may inhibit it by directly binding the virus thus inhibiting the infectious process it has been reported that lactobacilli are able to bind and inactivate viruses through adsorptive andor trapping mechanisms bacterial strains of lactobacillus paracasei lactobacillus rhamnosus as well as lactobacillus plantarum can interact with the envelop of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv directly trapping the virus 61 an inhibiting mechanism involving a direct interaction between bacterial cell wall components and herpes simplex virus type 2 has been also suggested for lactobacillus brevis cd2 strain 62 furthermore exopolysaccharides from lactobacillus species were demonstrated to completely suppress the production of adenovirus-5 in vitro 63lactobacilli as well as other probiotics have been reported to possess an immunomodulatory ability and protect from virus infections by enhancing cytokine antiviral responses in respiratory and immune cells and in the intestinal mucosa 6364656667 oral administration of l brevis in mice protected the animals from influenza infection through the enhancement of antiviral ifn- as well as an augmented production of specific-iga antibodies against the virus 68 l plantarum significantly reduced the titers of human h1n1 and avian influenza h7n9 viruses in mouse lungs after a lethal viral challenge and increased the mean number of days and rates of survival of the infected mice 69interestingly intranasal administration of lactobacilli showed to be protective against virus respiratory infections encouraging innate immune responses directly in the airway epithelium 70 in addition l paracasei-fed mice showed a lower incidence of influenza a h3n2 infection associated with a reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs and a faster virus elimination 71 bacteria belonging to the bifidobacteria group exert protective effects against influenza virus infection after lethal influenza a h1n1 infection a strong stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity associated with lower levels of proinflammatory il-6 production and an increase in survival rate of mice receiving bifidobacterium bifidum with respect to the control group was observed 72 another important preventive action of probiotics against the progression of viral infections could be mediated by the enhancement of the mucosal intestinal barrier that in turn may prevent virus spreading in the sub-mucosal compartment and in the systemic circulation a multi-strain probiotic mixture has demonstrated a preventive effect on intestinal inflammation onset in a mouse model of spontaneous ileitis mediated by the stimulation of tnf release from epithelial cells and decreased permeability 7374 l rhamnosus gg has shown a beneficial effect in the treatment of infections by enhancing intestinal permeability with the stimulation of mucin expression and the regulation of proliferationapoptosis of epithelial cells both in experimental models and in clinical studies 7576an interesting antiviral activity exerted by probiotics is related to their ability to modulate the immune system towards anti-inflammatory pathways lactobacillus gasseri exhibits antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus rsv in fact oral administration of this probiotic in mice causes a reduction of the rsv titer in the lungs moreover the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the lungs due to rsv infection decreased while interferon-stimulated genes were upregulated by l gasseri treatment 77 a reduction of virus-induced inflammation was also exerted by a strain of l plantarum in mice after acute infection by pneumonia virus pmv a rodent pathogen that induces inflammation and is related to the respiratory syncytial virus 78 bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis bl-04 in an experimental rhinovirus infection showed to reduce the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 as well as to reduce the nasal lavage virus titer 79 similarly the administration of this probiotic in the respiratory tract of mice infected with pvm increased mice survival and reduced the levels of il-6 whose suppression was demonstrated to be a critical feature of the protective mechanism it was recently reported that covid-19 similarly to sars-cov is characterized by a dramatic inflammatory response induced by a cytokine storm associated with increased disease severity 8081 patients needing intensive care present higher plasma levels of many cytokines such as il-6 il-1 ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf 82 with respect to non- intensive care unit icu subjects suggesting the likely involvement of a highly pro-inflammatory condition in the disease progression and severity furthermore a large infiltration of inflammatory cells has been observed in the lungs of severe covid-19 patients 8384 these aberrant pathogenic cells together with inflammatory monocytes may reach the lungs causing an immune injury with consequent respiratory disability and increased mortality the modulation of the cytokine cascade exerted by probiotics may represent a therapeutic approach for severe infections making it licit to hypothesize that probiotics administration could influence the immune response in patients affected by covid-19 thus preventing or mitigating the exacerbated inflammatory processes that lead to deathalthough solid evidence for probiotics utilization in the treatment of covid-19 is still lacking their complementary use may be proposed as already stated by chinas national health commission and national administration of traditional chinese medicine in the diagnostic and therapeutic guidance for 2019 novel coronavirus disease version5 85 in particular probiotic supplementation was suggested as a complementary treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and to reduce the risk of secondary infections due to microbial translocation in severe covid-19 cases 86 despite the fact that direct evidence of the possible effect of probiotics on sars-cov-2 infection is not available 87 a number of suggestions indicate that this resource could represent a complementary tool to decrease sars-cov-2-related inflammation and favor the recovery of intestinal mucosa damage by modulating the gut microbiota in fact recent studies suggest that sars-cov-2 induces an acute intestinal inflammatory response via ace2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 characterized by mucosal infiltration of macrophages neutrophils and t-cells 88 for these reasons probiotic use could have a beneficial role in patients with covid-related gastro-intestinal symptoms and in those with mildmoderate systemic symptoms without respiratory impairment and help prevent disease progression as speculated it is possible that probiotics may play a role in preventing the cytokine storm and related ards or mof in high-risk individuals with established sars-cov-2 infection but the opposite may also be true and the lack of sufficient available evidence should be considered similarly in patients with severe disease and in critically ill patients probiotic administration needs to be cautiously evaluated and important safety concerns need to be considered when administering bacterial supplements 89 in fact it is not known whether the administration of micro-organisms to patients with critical disease conditions could lead to any type of injury such as an exacerbation of inflammation a final possible setting is disease prevention especially for high-risk patients immunosuppressed and elderly patients with comorbidities strategic people ie health care professionals workers with extensive public contact or subjects with suspected covid-19 waiting for a clear diagnosis andor who came in contact with a covid-19-positive subject the rationale for the possible prophylactic use of probiotics in sars-cov2 infection is linked to its ability to preserve a healthy status in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue galt as well as eubiosis which is necessary to actively fight the entry of the virus into gut cells 90 the enhancement of the innate defenses may be probably useful in covid-19 prevention or in the very early phase of the infection however it is not known whether the administration of various types of microorganisms to healthy individuals can increase the risk of contracting sars-cov-2 infection large clinical trials are needed to elucidate these hot topics and identify the most useful and safe setting for probiotics administration actually three registered trials to evaluate probiotics administration to covid-19 patients are ongoing table 1chronic respiratory diseases are associated with the development of systemic inflammation and oxygen stress resulting in endothelial dysfunction together with increased platelet aggregation and enhanced coagulation all these factors are involved in the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases leading to irreversible endothelial dysfunction 94it has been previously demonstrated that patients with community-acquired pneumonia cap the most common infection-related cause of death in developed countries display increased platelet activation mediated by the activation of nox2 the main enzymatic source of cellular reactive oxygen species ros production with consequent decrease of flow-mediated dilation fmd and no bioavailability 949596 moreover these patients disclose an ongoing pro-thrombotic state as suggested by increased plasma levels of f12 a marker of thrombin generation and lower levels of protein c pc and activated pc apc 9495in severe forms of covid-19 it has been proposed that a severe widespread alveolar and interstitial inflammation extends to the pulmonary vasculature intra-pulmonary inflammation might negatively modulate a severe local vascular dysfunction including micro-thrombosis and hemorrhage resulting in pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy picaccordingly the reduced endothelial function that is an early subclinical stage of vascular alteration could favor the development of a severe form of this pathology contributing to increased pulmonary cardiovascular and renal complicationsthe immune system is the second system most affected by covid-19 after the respiratory system an increase in systemic interleukins chemokines and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- has been observed during the rapid progression phase of covid-19 80 these changes correspond to the characteristics of a cytokine release syndrome crs in which il-6 contributes to many of the key symptoms the role of il-6 in covid-19 patients has been highlighted in a recent retrospective multicenter study 97 showing that circulating il-6 levels were higher in covid-19 deceased patients compared to discharged subjects these results suggest that the cytokine storm syndrome activated by the virus could be a clinical predictor of fatal outcome in these patients the activation of endothelial cells and the ensuing vascular dysfunction are other typical features of severe crs indeed typical markers of endothelial activation are often elevated in the serum of patients with crs this indicates that the endothelium plays an important role in the pathophysiology of crs both by amplifying the inflammatory response and by contributing to clotting and eventually to a thrombotic disease both in the venous and in the arterial circulations 98in addition to the inflammatory process the mechanisms accounting for clotting and vascular changes may also include oxidative stress in particular nox2-derived ros are implicated in clotting and platelet activation promoting thrombin generation and platelet aggregation or impairing artery dilatationthus oxidative stress and inflammation are closely interrelated and form a vicious feed-forward cycle during atherogenetic plaque progress indeed according to the oxidative stress theory of atherosclerosis the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque with plaque rupture clotting and ensuing atherothrombosis is dependent upon artery inflammation 99based on these considerations nutraceuticals defined as substances that may include isolated nutrients dietary supplements diets and herbal products could play a role in preventing the phenomena of the inflammatory cascade and hypercoagulation by exerting their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities among nutraceuticals vitamin e vitamin c carotenoids and some minerals zn mn cu se and polyphenols flavonoids phenolic acids stilbenes lignans provide medical or health benefits by a synergistic effect maintaining a proper redox homeostasis figure 2in particular a diet rich in polyphenols is able to reduce and prevent cardiovascular disease 100 moreover the protective effect of polyphenols includes the reduction of oxidative stress resulting from the downregulation of nadph oxidase or from an antiplatelet and anticoagulant function as indicated by the reduction of platelet aggregation and the suppression of the activity of thrombin and the production of factor xa 101102 moreover flavonoids could increase endogenous platelet-derived nitric oxide and decrease superoxide production 103 and might enhance the endothelial synthesis of no induce no-dependent relaxation in isolated arteries and activate no signaling pathways in endothelial cells thus improving the endothelial function finally some polyphenols exert anti-inflammatory activities by modulating cytokine production and by promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes 104 and an antiviral effect that has been already reported against several viruses 105given this premise it is reasonable to consider oxidative stress- and inflammation-mediated endothelial dysfunction as a therapeutic target for covid-19 among polyphenols curcumin could be a potential treatment option for patients with covid-19 utomo et al conducted a study using molecular docking with target receptors including sars-cov-2 protease the receptor binding domain rbd of spike glycoprotein and the protease domain pd of ace2 which are believed to participate in virus infection 106 they demonstrated that curcumin could bind to the target receptors of sars-cov-2 supporting the use of this molecule for preventive or prophylaxis treatments of virus infections including sars-cov-2 moreover a combination of three phyto- nutrients such as vitamin c curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid promotes interferons production and regulates the inflammatory response suggesting that the combination of these molecules may be helpful in regulating the immune response to combat sars-cov-2 infections 107finally runfeng et al tested in vitro the antiviral activity of lianhuaqingwen lh a chinese patent nutraceutical composed of 13 herbs 108 and they found that lh is able to inhibit sars-cov-2 virus replication and markedly reduce the mrna levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf- il-6 ccl-2mcp-1 and cxcl-10ip-10in conclusion since accumulating evidence suggests that nutraceuticals exert beneficial effects against vascular diseases counteracting oxidative stress and inflammation it is reasonable to speculate their possible use in the setting of covid-19regarding the illustrated inflammatory hypothesis new recent considerations on tnf blockers deserve a mention further promising and potentially effective therapies for covid-19 are the anti-tnf antibodies infliximab and adalimumab which have also shown a good safety profile 109 the rationale of their use is related to the demonstrated presence of tnf in the serum and in some tissues of covid-19 patients where it promotes a phlogistic response 110 for several inflammatory diseases anti-tnf therapies are approved by the fda and commonly used eg rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis studies on rheumatoid arthritis have shown that blocking tnf stops the cytokine cascade decreasing the levels of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf involved in the pathways of augmented vascular permeability 111112 also some preclinical studies on rsv and influenza virus in mice suggest a positive response to anti-tnf therapies 113 some authors suggested that infliximab or adalimumab administration could be preferentially destinated to covid-19 patients with moderate disease but at high risk to develop a severe and advanced illness 109114 actually a single registered rct evaluating adalimumab for covid-19 treatment is in progress chictr2000030089 main nutraceuticals and supplements with potential role in countering covid-19 are listed in table 2vitamin c is a water-soluble vitamin able to provide electrons acting as antioxidant and as a cofactor for regulatory enzymes in particular it facilitates the production of cortisol catecholamines and vasopressin vitamin c is fundamental for both the innate and the adaptive immune system vitamin c has a role in the epithelial as well as endothelial barrier function maintains vasodilation and reduces proinflammatory modulators 115 vitamin c has crucial roles in the improvement of phagocytosis chemotaxis and production of ros decreasing necrosis and tissue damage 116the role of ascorbic acid in modulating the immune system has been studied extensively since the second half of the last century as early as 1978 a study by jg atherton et al showed increased resistance of chicken respiratory epithelium cultures to infection by a coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus after exposure to vitamin c however this animal virus does not share the receptor and pathway with sars-cov-2 for which there is no specific evidence regarding potential vitamin c benefits 117in humans supplementation of vitamin c improves the immune system preserving the redox integrity of cells as well as protecting from ros vitamin c reduces the risk the severity and the duration of different infectious diseases 118119vitamin c deficiency was historically associated with pneumonia 120121 on the other hand randomized trials demonstrated that supplementation of vitamin c has positive effects on symptoms and on the duration of respiratory tract infections additionally several data suggest that vitamin c can prevent pneumonia and improve its outcome as well as other infections 122123124125moreover it has been shown that intravenous vitamin c may reduce inflammation and diminish vascular injury associated with sepsis and ards 126127 studies on lung injury induced by sepsis showed that vitamin c reduces the proinflammatory and procoagulant changes that lead to lung damage 126 moreover during infection vitamin c levels can decrease therefore high doses of intravenous vitamin c administration are required in severe cases in order to compensate for the high turnover of the vitamin 128however studies on the usefulness of vitamin c for patients with severe pneumonia are limited 129 a retrospective beforeafter clinical study showed that a combination of vitamin c hydrocortisone and thiamine prevented organ dysfunction and reduced the mortality rate in patients with sepsis 130 treatment with the same combination was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and significantly improved their radiologic chest findings 131 vitamin c and corticosteroids play in a synergistic way vitamin c restores glucocorticoid receptor function and corticosteroids increase the expression of sodiumvitamin c transporter-2 132133 moreover an experimental study showed that vitamin c and hydrocortisone administered together preserved endothelial integrity 134 in a recent randomized trial evaluating patients with sepsis and ards a beneficial effect of high-dose intravenous vitamin c on mortality has been suggested although no improvement of organ dysfunction scores or change in markers of inflammation and vascular injury were observed 135136137 moreover recently a new clinical trial to investigate the effects of vitamin c infusion for the treatment of severe covid-19 pneumonia has started 138 in fact in the absence of a specific therapy for covid-19 vitamin c may have effects on this severe viral respiratory tract infection 139 moreover vitamin c increased the resistance to coronavirus and may affect the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions 117139140141the biosignaling role of vitamin d in bone metabolism is well known but over the years this metabolite has been linked to the risk of developing various pathologies such as cancer depression and infectious diseases after binding its nuclear receptor the active metabolite of vitamin d 125oh2d3 or calcitriol influences gene transcription exerting several effects also on the immune and inflammatory response as recently summarized in a review by grant et al vitamin d would act against respiratory infections through many pathways 142 the receptor for vitamin d is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells and in macrophages of the respiratory system furthermore the 25- hydrolase which converts vitamin d into its active metabolite is constitutively expressed in the respiratory epithelium 143 the in vitro study of philip et al showed that in the presence of 125oh2d3 macrophagic production of catelicidine like ll-37 is increased by binding the envelope of influenza a and respiratory syncytial viruses catelicidins are capable to damage its structure and prevent infection of human cells 144much evidence has also suggested that other biosignaling pathways linked to vitamin d may modulate the inflammatory response depending on both the innate and specific systems in fact 125oh2d3 modulates nuclear factor b nf-kb activity via upregulation of the nf-b inhibitory protein ib nf-kb induces the production of many molecules which amplify the inflammatory response il-6 il1- tnf- stimulate the production mobilization and adhesion of inflammatory cells gm-csf il-4 il-5 vcam-1 icam-1 e-selectin and finally influence the production of enzymes such as inos cox-2 pla2 and determine the production of free radicals causing tissue damage 145146there are many other molecular mechanisms through which vitamin d would be able to stimulate the immune response reduce the risk of infections and balance the inflammatory reaction probably in a favorable way for the body the study of the clinical effects of vitamin d administration in patients with and without demonstrated vitamin d deficiency could be very interesting today in the setting of covid-19 however specific data are not yet availablein the analysis of monlezun et al evaluating 14108 subjects 16 years of age after adjusting for confounding factors like season or demographic and clinical data vitamin d levels 30 ngml were associated with 58 higher odds of acute respiratory infection compared to levels 30 ngml 147a meta-analysis of data of 10933 participants from 25 randomized controlled trials showed that vitamin d administration reduces the risk of acute respiratory tract infections or 088 081 to 096 p for heterogeneity 0001 in subgroup analysis protective effects were obtained for participants assuming daily or weekly doses with no supplemental bolus or 081 072 to 091 but not for subjects assuming one or more boli or 097 086 to 110 p for interaction  005 regarding the daily or weekly administration of vitamin d benefits were more evident in participants with low calcifediol levels 25 nmoll at baseline or 030 017 to 053 than in subjects with initial levels 25 nmoll or 075 060 to 095 p for interaction  0006 finally the administration of vitamin d was safe 148the hypothesis that vitamin d supplementation can reduce the risk of covid-19 incidence or mortality should be investigated through large-scale randomized trials currently no data are available on the dosage method of administration daily or bolus and safety in the setting of covid-19 however for the moment it is reasonable to focus on the identification and treatment of deficiencies in asymptomatic subjects as well as in patients affected by covid-19 an italian study group has proposed a nutritional protocol for patients with covid-19 which also includes the supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin d in the presence of a deficit 149although orally administered probiotics are not currently an integral part of a specific protocol for the treatment of respiratory viral infections many studies suggest their potential modulation of the systemic immune system that can improve the response to viruses and balance the inflammatory response sars-cov-2 infects the gastrointestinal tract causing inflammation of the absorbent mucosa and sometimes diarrhea dysbiosis could participate in this scenario exacerbating the immune response and the production of systemic inflammation mediators based on the revised evidence oral probiotics could therefore play a role in the intestinal and systemic effects of covid-19 moreover inhaled microorganisms could have a more direct action on the respiratory epithelium and on the immune system cells that populate it in some circumstances they have been shown to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells and facilitate virus clearance several nutrients have shown utility in preserving endothelial integrity thanks to the maintenance of oxidativereductive homeostasis covid-19 can induce pulmonary vascular damage and systemic hypercoagulability during the pandemic as in all other circumstances it is reasonable to recommend a proper nutrition rich in antioxidant nutrients vitamin c and d play a well-proven role in the immune system however it is not known whether a supplemental dose of these vitamins administered to patients without their deficiency would result in a benefit specific clinical studies are underway on the intra-venous administration of vitamin c in hospitalized covid-19 patients vitamin d deficiency has been associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections therefore it is reasonable even in the absence of specific data to administer vitamin d to healthy individuals and covid-19 patientswhile diet nutritional supplements and similar interventions show great promise for preventing and managing covid-19 it is also true that strong clinical research data are required to support any such claim otherwise we risk the emergence of gurus or other more or less well-meaning experts aiming at speculating on the appeal of these interventions for laypersons 150the novel coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 was already shown to induce a systemic inflammatory response which is accompanied by an excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokinesfurthermore covid-19 is commonly accompanied by hemodynamic abnormalities such as an increased coagulation activity increasing the risk for venous thromboembolic eventsin our short communication we focus on the relation of cytokines and chemokines release and the influence of coagulation factors on the inflammatory response of peripheral mononuclear blood cells pbmcsafter 24 h of incubation time 20 serum was the main trigger for the release of several cytokines and chemokines in comparison to heparinized plasma furthermore it was shown that the addition of fibrin to the pbmcs resulted in a significant increase of the cytokines and chemokines measured in a dose-dependent manneranti-coagulation could constitute a potential tool to handle and treat the circle between inflammation and thrombosis in covid-19 reducing a profound cytokine storm and thrombotic complicationsin december 2019 the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerged causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 was found to infect lung alveolar cells cardiac myocytes vascular epithelial and endothelial cells as well as inflammatory cells including macrophages monocytes and lymphocytes 1 2 this phenomenon is primarily due to the virus portal of entry the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is highly expressed in vascular tissues 3 consequently endothelial injury is a crucial indicator of sars-cov-2 infection 2 clinically the disease manifests with symptoms including fever cough dyspnea and myalgia the infection mortality rate is a subject to debate but likely higher than for seasonal influenza 4 the higher risk of mortality is primarily due to the risk for severe illnesses such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome septic shock multi-organ involvement and most notably acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 there is also increasing evidence that covid-19 differs from classic ards with regards to respiratory characteristics and optimal ventilatory management 6generally acute inflammation intravascular coagulation and platelet activation characterize ards in covid-19 patients excessive cytokine release and cytokine storm have been reported in response to sars-cov-2 infection in particular vast amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 il-6 are released although whether il-6 is foremost a marker for the severe illness or the diseases mediator itself is still unknown yet its levels in circulation seem to correlate with disease severity and the propensity for a pro-coagulant status in addition to il-6 also higher levels of il-1 il-2 il-4 il-7 il-10 interferon-gamma ifn- if--induced protein 10 ip-10 tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- granulocyte-colony stimulating factor macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and myocyte chemotactic protein mcp-1 as well as c-reactive protein crp and d-dimer have been found in circulation this cytokine storm may also seem to correlate with the severity of disease or mortality 7 due to the lack of not only an appropriate vaccine but also effective antiviral treatment to sars-cov-2 anti-cytokine therapies targeting il-6 or il-1 have been proposed to serve as a potential therapy against the ongoing cytokine storm 5 8 the il-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is currently under investigation to serve as a treatment option for covid-19 5 8furthermore recent studies revealed that sars-cov-2 infections are commonly accompanied by hemostatic abnormalities such as elevated coagulation activity leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 9 complement activation is one initiating pathway responsible for the innate immune responses that promotes inflammation and often defends against bacteria and virus infections furthermore the complement system and the coagulation cascade are closely linked which may provoke hypercoagulability and thrombosis excessive activation of the complement system is therefore associated with several pathologic events such as thrombotic microangiopathy and organ dysfunction fig 1 it has already been described that patients with sars-cov-2 infections exhibit a higher risk for venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism the clinical parameters of patients suffering from severe covid-19 correlate with an excessive complement activity high lactate dehydrogenase d-dimer and bilirubin concerning this increased levels of d-dimer were shown to serve as a particularly important marker for coagulopathy 10 and pulmonary embolism 11 additionally an in vitro study in which vero cells were infected with a sars-associated cov has outlined the potential of heparin to inhibit the infection by 50 12 in vivo heparin has already proven to significantly lower the rate of mortality due to sars-cov-2 infection 13 consequently there is evidence suggesting a link between the coagulation pathway and the inflammatory responseto prove this assumption we performed an in vitro study to investigate the potential of an activated coagulation cascade or clotting factors to trigger the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines human peripheral mononuclear blood cells pbmcs from healthy volunteers n  7 were treated with either autologous serum or heparinized plasma respectively as in serum the coagulation cascade has already been progressed to a final state the addition of autologous serum used to clarify the influence of the coagulation factors released into serum on the pbmcs on the contrary in heparinized plasma the coagulation cascade is inhibited due to the presence of heparin presenting a hypocoagulable environment in addition to that the different doses of the coagulation factor fibrin sigma-aldrich usa were used to unveil the effect of this specific coagulation factor on cytokine expression and secretion cells were incubated at 37 c and 4 co2 at the different treatment conditions negative control autologous serum autologous heparinized plasma or fibrin for 0 h h 4 h or 24 h respectively supernatant cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from rd systems minneapolis mn usa human il-1 betail-1f2 duoset human il-6 duoset human il-8 cxcl8 duoset human ccl2mcp-1 duoset and human tnf-alpha duoset and human il-1ra the results were calculated in graphpad prism software graphpad-software la jolla ca usa due to non-gaussian approximation the results are given as median  interquartile range iqrour results revealed that the treatment of pbmcs with 20 autologous serum for 24 h in comparison to heparinized plasma led to the greatest inflammatory response outlined by the significant alteration of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the secretome in particular the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 and il-6 were significantly elevated in the pbmcs supernatant rising from 00  00 pgml at baseline to 6646  15917 pgml p  002 after 24 h for il-1 and an il-6 concentration from 824  419 pgml at baseline to 83310  89860 pgml p  003 also tnf- and il-1ra were significantly altered by the treatment of pbmcs with autologous serum moreover the chemokine il-8 increased markedly from 666  661 pgml at baseline to 167760  206650 pgml at 24 h p  002 as it is the case for mcp-1 00  110 pgml at baseline to 19650  12800 pgml after 24 h p  0016 although the treatment of pbmcs by heparinized plasma resulted in a significant increment of supernatant il-8 and mcp-1 levels the increase was not as high as it is the case for autologous serum furthermore all cytokines and chemokines measured were markedly higher for serum than for heparinized plasma after 24 h see fig 2we analyzed the secretome of pbmcs treated with rising concentrations of fibrin 025 g 05 g 10 g 50 g 250 g and 500 g for 24 h our data unveiled a significant rise of il-6 tnf- and il-8 in a concentration-dependent manner the treatment of pbmcs with 500 g fibrin resulted in the greatest cytokine and chemokine values for instance il-6 supernatant levels rose from 1045  153 pgml at baseline to 40000  34610 pgml p  0008 due to the treatment with 500 g fibrin in addition to that the chemokine il-8 was significantly altered by the treatment with fibrin from 6404  90739 pgml to 174750  32720 pgml p  001 see fig 3 these in vitro results confirm the association of coagulation and the inflammatory response of the immune systemour data support the findings of yang et al 14 where plasma samples of patients infected with sars-cov-2 were examined and outlined an increase of 14 cytokines triggering inflammation in response to covid-19 there are many other evidence that the activation of coagulation has a marked impact on the cytokine-storm associated with the infection as recently reviewed in bikdeli et al 9 among others there are several hemostatic changes in response to sars-cov-2 infection including mild thrombocytopenia and increased d-dimer levels furthermore some case studies indicate an association between the severity of disease and a potential prolongation of prothrombin time and thrombin time as well as a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time concerning this our study confirms that coagulation may increase the inflammatory response eventually resulting in a feedback loop further triggering the hypercoagulable state although our data does not outline the reverse progress that inflammation may serve as a trigger for a hypercoagulable state it is already known that eg sepsis may be complicated by dic supporting our data and speculations a recent study by patel et al addressed the expression of inflammatory markers in sepsis an dic and could unveil a positive correlation of il-6 il-8 il-10 and tnf- with dic score 15in addition to that severe cases of covid-19 exhibit an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism vte a chinese study reported that 40 of covid-19 patients were highly prone to vte 16 also danzi et al 10 reported a case study that a woman infected with sars-cov-2 was hospitalized due to severe bilateral pneumonia ct scans have unveiled a severe pulmonary embolism although no predisposing factors for vte were known in addition patients with severe pneumonia due to covid-19 had a higher platelet count contributing to the increased risk of thrombosis 13 in a small case series a relation between covid-19 and large-vessel stroke was also proposed 17based on available in vitro data and first clinical impressions anti-coagulation could be a cornerstone in successfully managing covid-19 9 13 18 besides preventing thrombotic complications anti-coagulation could mitigate the vicious circle between inflammation and thrombosis in covid-19 therapeutic anti-coagulation might be warranted in critically sick covid-19 patients for non-severely ill covid-19 patients preventive anti-coagulation could reduce thrombotic complications and have the potential to help minimize the risk for full-blown cytokine storm although covid-19 patients could benefit from the treatment with anti-coagulants it is not yet proven that their usage would also reduce the inflammatory response due to sars-cov2 infection as far as the safety of the treatment with oral anticoagulants is concerned the risk for advanced bleeding of covid-19 patients has to be consideredthe rapid pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 poses one of the most significant global challenges in the 21st century the clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and associated death 1 at the time of writing more than three million people are officially infected worldwide and more than 200000 people died due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection unfortunately there are no proven therapies especially no vaccination for sars-cov-2 and experiences with previous cov epidemics reflect the ongoing and difficult challenge of finding effective treatment 23at present there is a lack of data on how covid-19 affects people with neuroimmunological diseases in particular neuromuscular disorders can affect respiratory muscles and there is a heightened sense of concern for the potential risk of sars-cov-2 infections and the severity of manifestations 4 moreover most patients with neuroinflammatory disorders are on immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies due to its nature and previous evidence from other respiratory viral infections immunosuppression appears to be another risk factor for both becoming infected with sars-cov-2 and developing serious complications 5 however stabilizing the neuroimmunological disorder with immunosuppression could hinder disease exacerbation and potentially outweighs the higher risks of infection 4 current uncertainty about applying immunotherapies is illustrated by numerous but inconsistent recommendations circulated by national and international societies for diverse neuroimmunological diseasessimilar to other severe virus infections the disease characteristics of covid-19 comprise two critical phases in which the interplay between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the host appear to play an important role in the disease-related outcome fig 1
a 67 though an adequate and rapid immune response weakens virus replication and cytopathic tissue damage the virus-induced increased host immunity however seems to conversely cause organ failure like ards and a cytokine storm fig 1b 89while the elevated risk of infection under immunomodulatory therapies is obvious there is increasing evidence that the application of tailored immunotherapies may have beneficial effects in dampening excessive inflammation in late stages of infection 5 thus experience in treating neuroinflammatory disorders could help to estimate the risk of infection with sars-cov-2 and to identify therapeutic strategies to minimize severe overactivation of the immune response following the viral phase of sars-cov-2 infection 9
here we provide an overview covering the known and suspected sars-cov-2 induced immunological mechanisms and the related potential risks under currently recommended immunotherapies used in neuroinflammatory disorders but also opportunities of those approaches to treat the second phase of covid-19references for this narrative review were identified by searches of pubmed for articles published between 1990 and 15th april 2020 the first and the last authors used combinations of the terms coronavirus covid-19 sars mers multiple sclerosis neuroimmunological disorder neuroinflammatory disorder immunosuppression cytokine storm disease modifying therapy and vaccination and applied no language restrictionssars-cov-2 belongs to the group of highly diverse enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses and is the third known highly pathogenic zoonotic cov after the sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov 2 despite the large number of current publications on covid-19 conclusions regarding the pathogenesis are mainly drawn from clinical observations and experimental studies with sars-cov and mers-cov 21011 unfortunately the persistent lack of treatment options and the associated high mortality rates of these two covs underline the current challenge to treat covid-19 successfully 23 with regard to the two different disease stages of covid-19 different immunological pathways are emerging that offer potential treatment targets fig 1bin the viral response phase receptor-mediated viral attachment and entry of sars-cov2 into the target cells are realized by the host angiotensin ii converting enzyme ace-ii receptor binding to the viral spike glycoprotein 12 cells with high ace-ii expression are present in the salivary glands of the mouth the whole respiratory tract and lung epithelial cells 13 moreover sars-cov particles and viral genome have been detected in macrophages and lymphocytes as well as vascular endothelial cells 14the early cytopathic and inflammatory effects are related to rapid viral replication interfering with protein synthesis and function in infected cells leading to progressive dysfunction and finally apoptosis additionally the virus induces a downregulation and shedding of the ace-ii receptor causing pulmonary injury and the release of exuberant pro-inflammatory mediators 71516 certain innate and adaptive immune cells provide important immune counterparts during the first stage of inflammation early-on synthesized and released viral proteins are recognized by the endosomal toll-like receptor 7 of infected tissue or innate immune cells macrophages neutrophils and dendritic cells leading to activation of intracellular pattern recognition receptors and transmembrane proteins 617 the latter mechanisms converge on the activation of protein kinases which in turn activate interferon ifn regulatory transcription factors that stimulate tumor necrosis factor- tnf- as well as interleukin il1 il-6 il-8 and il-12 transcription and secretion in addition to the inhibitory effects against viral replication in both infected and non-infected cells chemokine secretion induces an adaptive immune response primarily driven by t cells 61819 t cell differentiation and stimulation are supported by antigen presentation due to dendritic cells and cytokine release of cd4
t cells 2021 cytotoxic t cells recognize cytosolic viral peptides presented by mhc class i molecules cd8
t cells directly kill infected cells activate nucleases that degrade viral genomes and initiate further cytokine secretion that activates phagocytosis by pulmonary macrophages 22 in terms of virus-induced shutoff of mhc class i expression on the infected cells natural killer nk cells can recognize and kill virus-infected tissue cells as well 182023in most covid-19 patients the primary inflammatory reaction results in a reduction of viral activity followed by decremental dampening of inflammation 7 the more significant challenge represent the secondary phase of inflammation in some patients characterized by a cytokine storm and leukocyte infiltration into pulmonary tissue fig 1b 9 currently various inadequate virus-induced immune defense mechanisms are being discussed during the viral response phase virus-neutralizing antibodies do not play a major role due to the lack of memory b cell clones however after b cell activation and proliferation anti-spike-protein-neutralizing antibodies might promote proinflammatory macrophage accumulation and production of matrix metalloproteinases leukotrienes and il-8 in the lungs by binding to fc receptors 24 il-8 has a negative impact on t cell priming by dendritic cells thereby providing an important mechanism for sars-cov2 to evade host immune responses the continuous circle of viral replication and death leads to cell pyroptosis which subsequently triggers massive cytokine release and immune cell migration into the lung 2425 moreover antibody-mediated activation of the complement system leads to chemokine production and invasion of granulocytes and lymphocytes that further increase pulmonary tissue damage fig 1b 10overall it can be concluded that different mechanisms of the innate and adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 infection are self-perpetuating indicating potential detrimental but also beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory treatment approaches against covid-19azathioprine methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are long-established therapies in myasthenia gravis mg neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders nmosd idiopathic inflammatory myopathies iim primary angiitis of the central nervous system pacns inflammatory neuropathies and autoimmune encephalitis while azathioprine and methotrexate are mainly used at disease onset and over a longer time cyclophosphamide is mainly indicated in severe disease exacerbations aiming at a preferably low small cumulative dose 26 mitoxantrone a type ii topoisomerase inhibitor is another immunosuppressive drug that was commonly used in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis spms and in treatment-refractory relapsing remitting ms rrms as well as in nmosd 27 all drugs are characterized by long-term lymphopenia and neutropenia resulting in higher infection rates 26teriflunomide is a recently approved immunosuppressive drug for rrms it reversibly inhibits the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase that is expressed in lymphocytes 28 though a notable decrease in peripheral lymphocyte counts of approximately 15 was observed the incidence of infections was comparable between placebo- and teriflunomide-treated rrms patients in both phase iii trials 2930 however the long-term risk of lymphopenia and infections in teriflunomide treated rrms patients seems to be low 31 besides the anti-inflammatory effect the inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway promotes antiviral properties as was already shown for various dna and rna viruses 32mycophenolate mofetil mmf currently used in mg iim pacns and nmosd reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and the synthesis of guanine monophosphate disrupting the de novo purine synthesis 33 consequently mmf mainly curtails the proliferation of t and b lymphocytes moreover mmf reduces the production of lymphocyte-derived proinflammatory cytokines such as ifn- and tnf- due to the mode of action mmf increases the possibility of infections through reactivating latent viruses 34 interestingly the active compound mycophenolic acid exhibits antiviral activity in vitro against various viruses including mers-cov 3536 an in vivo study with mers-cov infected marmosets however showed high viral loads with more severe or even fatal disease outcome 37 a case series of 8 patients treated with mmf and ifn- revealed an overall survival 38 nevertheless renal transplant recipients who were on maintenance mmf therapy also developed severe or fatal mers-cov infections 3 in conclusion continuous mmf therapy might increase the risk of infection while the antiviral properties could be exploited as an acute treatment approach against covid-19 however the previous results must be interpreted with caution since the usual dosage of mmf is unlikely to be a guarantee for prophylaxis or treatment of cov infections 39cladribine is a synthetic purine analog that disrupts dna synthesis and repair specifically in lymphocytes up to 4 months after application cladribine leads to a preferential decrease of circulating cd4t cells and for a shorter period to a reduction of nk cells mature and memory b cells and cd8
t cells 40 the resulting lymphopenia renders patients transiently more susceptible towards infections especially viral infections and reactivation 41 of note the pulsed immunosuppression shortly after administration is associated with a higher infectious risk but could be beneficial due to the long-term anti-inflammatory effect without associated immunosuppressionmonoclonal antibodies mab targeting b cells are frequently applied in neuroinflammatory disorders especially rituximab a chimeric anti-cd20 mab has shown promising effects in a wide range of inflammatory neurological disorders including mg nmosd autoimmune encephalitis inflammatory neuropathies as well as rrms 42 for rrms and primary progressive ms the humanized cd20 mab ocrelizumab received approval in 2018 4344 the cd20 molecule is expressed throughout b cell maturation thus both compounds effectively deplete late pre-b cells up to and including memory b cells but not early pro-b cells plasma cells or plasmablasts moreover the cd20 antigen is also expressed on a subset of cd4
t cells 4243inebilizumab is a mab against the cd19 antigen and has recently shown positive results in nmosd patients 45 compared to cd20 mab inebilizumab has a more pronounced impact on b-cell depletion since cd19 expression starts at the pro-b cell stage and cd19 is expressed on the majority of plasma cells 46 b-cell depletion is associated with a slightly increased frequency of upper respiratory tract infections and certain influenza and pneumonia cases 43 44 45 in particular the associated interference with cd4
t cells might reduce the acute defense against sars-cov2 concerning the repeated application of mab against cd19 and cd20 antigens the long-term absence of a b cell immune response appears to be the main issue in general all three drugs often show persistent b cell depletion even before the planned reapplication 43 44 45 however despite a recovery of the total b cell account the repopulated b cell compartment consists largely of naive b cells while memory b cells remain almost absent in peripheral blood for several years after the last administration 47 the lack of memory b cells might be relevant in the future for covid-19 since low vaccination response rates during b cell depletion treatment approaches are reported 48 however long-lived plasma cells themselves unaffected by cd20 mab and persisting after depletion of the b cell precursors suggests vaccination before treatment initiation contrary inebilizumab might predict a higher infectious risk due to the relevant depletion of long-lived plasma cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow 49 another risk factor for covid-19 is thought to be the treatment-related late-onset neutropenia which commonly occurs along with hypogammaglobinemia 50alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-cd52 mab approved for the therapy of active rrms the cd52 antigen is highly expressed on the surface of b and t cells and at lower levels on monocytes and macrophages 51 the rapid and profound lymphopenia in the first months following alemtuzumab administration results in a small but definite increase in the risk of infection 5152the repopulation dynamics of immune cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells are distinct for different immune cell types since t cell recovery is slower than b cell repopulation opportunistic infections are more likely to be associated with t cell depletion 53 however pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections might be related to the additionally documented hypogammaglobulinemia after t and b cell recovery 54 notably after the critical phase of lymphopenia induced by alemtuzumab there is both sufficient immunocompetence and corresponding inhibition of ms-related inflammatory activity in the further course of disease 51 moreover the pulsed nature of this treatment approach provides the opportunity to delay further therapy courses without a detectable impact on efficacy 55natalizumab is a recombinant humanized mab directed against alpha4-integrin molecules on leukocytes and blocks transmigration of peripheral immune cells into the cns 56 natalizumab is currently available for rrms treatment since focal immunosuppression rather increases the risk of serious opportunistic infections of the brain respiratory infections are rarely reported 57 alpha4-integrin also serves as a retention signal for mainly lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow thus natalizumab treatment results in an increase of nk cells t lymphocytes and especially b cells in the peripheral blood 5859 the higher b cell-mediated inflammatory state might be favorable against infectious disease moreover a decreased migration of lymphocytes after blocking alpha4-integrin was reported in inflammatory lung disease suggesting a possible protective effect of natalizumab in covid-19 infection 60favorable effects of peripheral sequestration of leukocytes are assumed for oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor s1pr modulators in ms therapy fingolimod is effective in treating rrms whereas siponomid was recently approved for secondary progressive by ema and relapsing forms by fda both medications inhibit lymphocyte egress out of secondary lymphoid organs resulting in a profound diminution of naive and central memory t cells and memory b cells in the periphery 6162 s1pr modulators lead to a peripheral lymphopenia up to 2030 compared to baseline with implications for infection rates although various reports underline pulmonary complications occurring during treatment with fingolimod modulation of s1pr was protective against experimental asthma and documented to inhibit pulmonary vascular leakage in murine models of acute lung injury 63 64 65 moreover fingolimod suppresses the il-6 and il-8 mrna expression and protein secretion from lung epithelial cells 66to date one clinical trial has examined changes of pneumonia severity on x-ray images in severe covid-19 cases under fingolimod table 1
glatiramer acetate is a mixture of synthetic polymers consisting of four amino acids and competes with myelin antigens for presentation to t cells there is no increased risk of infections observed in rrms patients 67like glatiramer acetate dimethyl fumarate is approved for rrms the mode of action has not been fully elucidated but may include anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective aspects dimethyl

promotes anti-inflammatory b-cell functions 6769 there is no heightened risk of infection during ifn- treatment only a few patients experience mild leukopenia or lymphopenia 67 ifn- is naturally secreted by fibroblasts and binds to the ifn receptor which activates the janus kinasesignal transducer and activator of the transcription pathway and consequently leads to increased gene expression of antiviral and antiproliferative molecules during a viral infection the extensive release of ifns is triggered by innate immune players 70 interestingly studies evaluating the antiviral activity of ifns have reported ifn- as the most potent of them in reducing mers-cov replication in vitro 7172 therefore combining ifn- with other antiviral agents is investigated in mers-cov both in vitro studies and clinical trials table 1 7374the inhibition of il-6 is an intensively investigated treatment approach for inflammatory diseases tocilizumab and satralizumab are mabs against the il-6 receptor and currently used in nmosd 7576il-6 production has been associated with predominantly pro-inflammatory effects il-6 is immediately produced in response to infections but also upregulated in chronic autoimmune processes 77 although potential antiviral properties of exogenous il-6 have been suggested mostly detrimental consequences of increased il-6 levels in infections have been reported 78 the increased expression of t cell-regulating molecules such as programmed cell death-1 and its ligand as well as synergistic interaction with il-17 lead to an increased inflammatory host stage subsequently il-6 is a key player in cytokine release syndromes crs seen in infections or after adoptive t cell therapy 7980 elevated systemic levels of il-6 were frequently reported with the exacerbation of clinical outcomes involving viral pathogens 7881 with respect to covid-19 crs are commonly reported in severe and fatal disease cases with corresponding high il-6 levels in the blood 982 83 84 interestingly tocilizumab is approved for the treatment of a chimeric antigen receptor t cell-induced crs 85 subsequently various reports also suggested a favorable outcome of tocilizumab treatment in severe crs in covid-19 cases 8687 in a non-randomized open-label clinical trial 21 patients with severe covid-19 received tocilizumab in addition to lopinavir and methylprednisolone all patients survived without side effects 88 the early signals of clinical improvement and the relatively low rate of side effects due to il-6 inhibition prompted initiation of an ongoing clinical trial table 1the humanized mab eculizumab blocks the cleavage and activity of complement factor 5 c5 ultimately inhibiting complement-mediated cell lysis it became the first mab approved for aquaporin-4-antibody-positive nmosd and for severe mg 8990 eculizumab is associated with a heightened risk of pneumococcal and meningococcal infections but also reports about viral infections are available at present possibly due to the complement-dependent regulation of t cell activation 9192 although the complement system plays a crucial role in the antiviral response of the host the increased complement activation during the inflammatory phase in covid-19 sheds new light on its possible destructive potential 93 in sars-cov-infected mice the complement system may not play a key role in controlling virus replication but mediates lung tissue damage by upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil activation 94 interestingly c3a and c5a blockade has been proposed as a treatment option for virus-induced acute lung injury and the anti-c5a antibody has been shown to weaken sever lung tissues injury in sars-cov infected mice 1093 to date a clinical trial with eculizumab in covid-19 is under investigation table 1cyclosporine a csa is an immunosuppressive drug that is commonly used in mg and iim cases 9596 csa therapy does not seem to render patients with neuroinflammatory disorders more susceptible to infections 97 csa binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin the inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of the nuclear factor of activated t cells from the cytosol into the nucleus thereby reducing the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes encoding eg cytokines such as il-2 although csa mainly targets t cell activation accumulating evidence supports a crucial regulatory impact on innate immune cells including dendritic cells macrophages and neutrophils 98 in vitro studies have shown that csa inhibits the replication of diverse covs 11 however studies in humans are still lacking and might be limited due to the very close margin between therapeutic and toxic blood concentrations 99glucocorticosteroids gcs are widely used in various neuroinflammatory diseasesgcs restrict the production of numerous inflammatory mediators and inhibit the migration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier 100long-term administration of gcs is associated with bacterial and viral infections in contrast to continuous treatment repeated pulse therapy does not increase the risk to develop bacterial infections but severe viral infections are reported 101 in terms of covid-19 there is currently a controversy concerning the application of gcs application in cases of ards or severe respiratory failure since previous data have shown increased mortality and secondary infection rates in cov patients 102103 however results from a clinical trial are still awaited table 1repeated administration of intravenous immunoglobulins ivig is a well-established immune-modulating therapy particularly in inflammatory neuropathies as well as mg besides their favorable role in pathogen recognition and clearance in immunodeficient patients ivig might have promising effects on pathogen-induced host inflammation regarding myeloid cell activation in the inflammatory phase ivig saturate the igg recycling capacity of neonatal fc receptors and consequently reduce the levels of antiviral neutralizing antibodies responsible for activation of macrophages and nk cells 104105 moreover ivig inhibit both tnf--induced nf-b activation in neutrophils and endothelial cells 104 ivig also reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production by mononuclear cells while they increase the production of the anti-inflammatory il-1 receptor antagonist 106 ivig can also expand regulatory t cells and suppress pathogenic th1 and th17 subsets 107 as dysregulated excessive complement activity is likely to be a key molecular mechanism in the acute inflammatory phase ivig-mediated neutralization of complement factors could be beneficial 108 ivig also inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and downregulate mrna expression of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion protein 1 109 in addition ivig attenuate il-1-dependent leukocyte adhesion to endothelium activation and tissue injury 106 the endothelial effects of ivig are thus potentially useful in ameliorating disease severity or possibly preventing the onset of acute inflammatory lung injury since only a few cases of ivig treatment for covid-19 have been reported to date but further immunotherapies have been administered conclusions about its efficacy could not be drawn however previous studies in septic patients showed a favorable outcome upon ivig administration and a clinical trial in covid-19 is still ongoing table 1 110therapeutic apheresis is considered as a treatment option in disease exacerbation of several neuroinflammatory disorders 111 higher infection rates are observed during and after treatment but mainly include catheter-associated infections with regard to the inflammatory host phase the removal of circulating inflammatory cytokines and the replacement of protective plasma proteins may counteract inflammation and vascular leakage 112 due to the small number of randomized trials in septic patients however only weak evidence exists to recommend plasma exchangealthough respective data are still lacking we believe that classical immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine methotrexate mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide might be associated with a higher risk of infection due to the caused long-lasting lymphopenia unfortunately such compounds are still continuously used for numerous neurological diseases as the corresponding approval studies for new selective therapies especially for orphan diseases are rarely conducted however a treatment cessation due to the covid-19 pandemic may both worsen the disease and increase the risk of poor outcome in case of a covid-19 infection in particular disease exacerbation might result in the need for acute therapy intervention with gcs which could also result in longer-lasting immunosuppression furthermore hospitalization could lead to a higher probability of exposure to already infected patients thus the associated risk of infection might be offset by the improvement in neurological function in severe disease cases by controlling the inflammation for long-term disease stability de-escalating strategies eg dose reduction could be considered for treatment initiation in orphan diseases such as mg or iim the off-label compounds mmf or csa might be more advisable than the therapies described above fortunately there are currently several selective immunotherapies for ms that offer more options in times of covid-19 in modest ms self-injected therapies glatiramer acetate ifn- dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide do not seem to be associated with an increased risk of covid-19 infection or complications due to their low level of immunosuppression and should therefore be initiated or continuedregarding active rrms the inhibition of leukocyte trafficking using fingolimod is related to a mildly increased risk of viral infections and complications in the context of natalizumab opportunistic cns infections are more relevant than systemic virus spread nevertheless treatment with natalizumab may offer more flexibility as a recent retrospective evaluation showed that extending the dosing interval to up to 6 weeks appeared to be associated with a lower progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy risk 113 the initiation and continuation of both drugs however do not pose an additional risk of developing more severe covid-19 to rrms patients in contrast treatment cessation might result in ms reactivation pulsed immunosuppressive therapies including mabs against cd1920 as well as cd52 and cladribine are associated with an increased infectious risk over a limited period after initiation however the extent of immunosuppression and the repopulation dynamics differ fundamentally between such therapeutic agents and should be considered in treatment decisions especially after b cell depletion with rituximab ocrelizumab or inebilizumab a reduced humoral immunity develops over the next 612 months and is maintained by the subsequent reapplication thus for repeated applications it seems to be advisable to use serological markers such as the cd19 b cell status to avoid long-term side effects like hypogammaglobinemia 50concerning the mode of action of cladribine and alemtuzumab a normalization of the total lymphocyte count due to immune reconstitution can be expected 612 months after application and at most leads to a slightly increased risk of severe virus infections the pulsed nature of these compounds provides the opportunity to delay therapy until the peak of the pandemic is overfor eculizumab there is currently no evidence of increased susceptibility to covid-19 infection or its outcome in light of its indication for active mg and nmosd cases therapy should therefore be initiated and continued the same applies to the use of mabs against il-6 in patients with nmosdwith regard to acute treatment approaches including ivig and therapeutic apheresis there is currently no sufficient evidence that either intervention poses an additional risk of covid-19 infection due to the increased risk of infection intravenous gcs therapies should only be conducted if there is a clear clinical indication such as relapses or as a required premedication in pulsed immunotherapy regimensin the event of an acute covid-19 infection the continuation of immunotherapy should be questioned critically especially considering the previous course of the neuroimmunological disease in particular with immunosuppressive therapies a sustained therapeutic effect can be expected for weeks and months even after the therapy has been discontinued these therapies should therefore be suspended in contrast selective immunotherapies such as glatiramer acetate ifn- teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate seems to be safe in case of covid-19 infection however in severe lymphopenia resulting from the latter therapy treatment should also be interruptedwith respect to immunotherapies for active rrms both natalizumab and fingolimod could be continued or stopped for few weeks before a disease reactivation or rebound are expected pulsed immunotherapies including treatment approaches with exclusive b-cell depletion alemtuzumab and cladribine should be delayed in case of an acute infection in view of both the safety data and the current indications especially in severe refractory cases mabs against il-6 complement inhibitors and csa should be continuedregarding the intensive search for vaccines the question arises to what extent an adequate vaccination response can be expected among recipients of immunotherapies whether vaccination is as effective under immunotherapies in neurological disorders as in the general population is not well studied unfortunately the few existing studies gave contradicting results 48114 while a sufficient vaccination response is more probable with immunomodulatory and selective treatment strategies immunosuppressants and especially b-cell depletion approaches might be unfavorable in such a situation overall immune reconstitution after pulsed cell depletion might be a determining factor for a successful vaccination with few side effects 114 on the other hand theoretically an increased immune response against different types of vaccines such as live attenuated viruses or inactive viruses as well as adjuvanted-containing vaccines could trigger immune response to self-antigen with increased relapse rates after vaccination 115furthermore the restriction on vaccines with live attenuated viruses especially under diseases modifying treatments must be observed 114in general immunotherapies are a mainstay in the management of neuroimmunological diseases while it is still unclear whether and how they increase the risk of covid-19 and its complications the risks of treatment cessation can be higher than the risk of a worsened covid-19 disease course under ongoing immunotherapy in this context factors such as the local prevalence rate for covid-19 might also play a role regarding future therapeutic decisionsmoreover the current lockdown in various countries around the world has led to limited availability of healthcare services future studies should therefore also investigate the relationship between such treatment delay and disease activity in general the potential long-term risk of infection must be considered in future treatment decisions hence approved selective immunotherapies from other indications should also be investigated for their use in rare neuroinflammatory diseases it is therefore appropriate to amend the off-label use regulations and in particular to consider immunological investigations in this review we have outlined several beneficial aspects of immunotherapies in covid-19 cases antiviral effects of ifn- csa and teriflunomide leukocyte sequestration by natalizumab or s1pr modulators complement inhibition by eculizumab as well as potential immunoregulatory effects in terms of a cytokine storm by ivig or gcs so far however the experience is limited to therapies that target il-6 this is mainly explained by previous successful observations with tocilizumab in crs which seems to be a hallmark in severe covid-19 cases 8788 the major challenge of the current and future covid-19 studies investigating the above-mentioned therapies could be to determine the right time for starting and discontinuing treatment several biomarkers are available to identify the beginning of the host response phase and should be considered as regular inclusion criteria in clinical trials 9 the use of immunotherapies other than tocilizumab beyond clinical trials or without using a standardized definition for the inflammatory host phase should be avoided as neither success nor failure will allow conclusions to be drawnthe ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respirat-ory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has caused over 92 million confirmed cases and 478000 deaths as of june 24th 2020 the high intensive care unit icu admission rate and mortality of covid-19 is continuously posing a serious strain on the global health-care system while most patients present with mild to moderate symptoms some patients may develop life-threatening sepsis respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure however current antiviral and supportive therapies are not sufficient to prevent or treat the above complications especially in severely ill covid-19 patients1 thus it is urgent to find the underlying mechanism dominating such life-threatening complications it is well recognized that lung damage and multi-organ failure in this subgroup of patients arise due to overwhelming systemic hyper-inflammation therefore promising anti-inflammatory candidate agents targeting diverse mechanisms related to cytokine storm will be therapeutically relevant fig 1
mounting evidence has demonstrated that severely ill covid-19 patients presented with elevated levels of cytokines and inflammatory indices such as serum il-1 il-6 il-10 and d-dimer than those with moderate symptoms suggesting the involvement of a cytokine storm2 cytokine storm represents an exaggerated immune response characterized by overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as ifn- tnf- il-6 il-1 il-18 cxcl8 and cxcl10 it has also been observed in other viral diseases such as influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers3 while an adequate release of cytokines is critical for the bodys defense against viral infection uncontrolled and aberrant immune system activation can lead to organ injury current clinical evidence also confirmed the correlation of cytokine storm syndrome and disease severity as well as unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients3 the association of unfavorable prognosis with the presence of over-inflammation and cytokine storm highlights the necessity of early identification of cytokine storm and implementation of anti-inflammatory treatment timely control of hyper-inflammatory response is crucial to prevent the development and progression of irreversible ards and multi-organ dysfunction accompanying covid-19in covid-19 patients the most widely used anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory agents include corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin ivig corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone and dexamethasone were considered as one of the options for covid-19 patients with cytokine storm4 based on their inhibition on many inflammatory genes and previous clinical use in other viral diseases on 17th june preliminary results from a randomized controlled clinical trial were released by the recovery randomised evaluation of covid-19 therapy study group in the united kingdom this study showed that low-dose dexamethasone could reduce mortality by one-third in critically ill patients in need of mechanical ventilation5 however previous studies associate the use of corticosteroid in sars mers and influenza with a higher risk of a delayed viral clearance and long-term complications in survivors6 yet much remains unknown regarding the impact of corticosteroids on other clinical outcomes of covid-19 combination effect with other drugs time window and dosage of administration safety profile as well as possible adverse effects currently there are dozens of ongoing clinical trials addressing the unsolved questions supplemental table ivig is also used as an adjunctive drug in the treatment of severe covid-19 patients as a puried blood product from healthy donors it exerts immunomodulatory effect mainly through neutralizing virus by antibodiespolyclonal immunoglobulin g igg it could also block fc receptors which are involved in natural and adaptive immunity currently a limited number of clinical studies have shown that ivig treatment within 48 h of admission reduced the use of mechanical ventilation duration of icu stay and hospitalization as well as 28-day mortality7 however more clinical evidence for its effectiveness in managing clinical covid-19 infection is warranted ongoing clinical trials of ivig including those from convalescent patients are listed in supplemental tablenod-like receptor protein 3 nlrp3 inflammasome protein complex is crucial in hosts antiviral defense during viral replication the invading virus plus a variety of derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps and danger-associated molecular patterns damps can active nlrp3 inflammasome upon activation nlrp3 inflammasome induces pyroptosis as well as the secretion of il-1 and il-18 which are responsible for recruitment of neutrophils to the inammatory sites to assist in the virus eradication and induction of the adaptive immune system however a persistent activation of nlrp3 inflammasome excessive production of inammatory cells and cytokine as well as pyroptosis-mediated cell damage jointly lead to organ injury8 activation of inflammasome pathway is indicated by the elevation of il-1in severe covid-19 patients therefore drugs targeting at nlrp3 inflammasome and il-1 are promising in mitigating nlrp3-inflammasome driven hyper-inflammation pyroptosis and cytokine storm syndrome in severely ill covid-19 patients colchicine a bioactive alkaloid compound isolated from plant colchicum has been commonly used for inflammatory diseases such as gout it acts as an inhibitor of nlrp3 inflammasome and interferes with polymerization by binding to free tubulin dimers leading to the deregulation of inflammatory cell activities and release of cytokines especially il-69 in addition colchicine also suppresses the production of numerous cytokines pyrogens and superoxides mediated by white blood cells with regard to safety profile of colchicine 5-10 patients administered with therapeutic dose may exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomit or diarrhea as side effects10 overall colchicine may be exploited as a potential candidate for alleviating the immune hyperactivity during sars-cov-2 infection recombinant il-1 receptor blocker such as anakinra and il-1monoclonal antibodies canakinumab are also of interest a prospective study showed that with a prospective cohort design showed that the treatment with anakinra contributes to a substantial reduction in mortality and use of invasive mechanical ventilation without bringing about serious side effects in critically ill covid-19 patients11 due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the above drugs their possible efficacy in covid-19 is gaining more and more attention currently there are a number of registered studies on clinicaltrials gov to test the effectiveness and safety of colchicine anakinra and canakinumab on covid-19 supplemental tablethe level of il-6 was significantly increased in covid-19 patients and was closely related to ards severity and outcome sars-cov-2 infection and subsequent release of virus particles recruits monocytes and macrophages leading to the release of cytokine and initiation of adaptive immune responses in this process il-6 played an essential role in most cases the immune response eliminates lung infection and the patients recovered however in others abnormal immune response triggered a cytokine storm which was characterized by persistent hypercytokinemia elevated il-6 tnf- il-1 eventually aggravated the lung injury and even had ripple effects through the entire body the immune dysregulation in severe covid-19 individuals was driven by il-612 and the il-6 deficiency was shown to reduce the severity in acute lung injury in mouse model13 therefore il-6 may be a potential target cytokine to treat covid-19 related ards il-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab a recombinant humanized monoclonal il-6 blocking antibody could curb il-6 mediated pro-inflammatory pathway through binding to the soluble and membrane fraction il-6 receptor il-6r probably via the nuclear factor kappa-b and stat3 signaling pathway tocilizumab seemed to be effective in covid-19 patients which decreased the use of mechanical ventilation improved hypoxemia and ct opacity changes in some severe cases and clinical trials14 tocilizumab has been prescribed for treatment in severe patients with elevated il-6 level in china since march 2020 according to the diagnosis and treatment program for covid-19 national health commission of china 7th version most notably il-6 could either inhibit or accelerate viral replication and function in the lung suffering from infection or chemical insults thus the optimal timing for anti-il-6 administration will be essential therefore il-6 blockers could be an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of covid-19 at present there are several registered studies under way to assess the safety and efficacy of il-6 blockers supplemental table further researches are required to evaluate the short-term and long-term outcomes of anti-il6 administration and determine the optimal time for drug administrationbromodomain containing protein 4 brd4 an epigenetic reader of acetylated lysines is a member of the bromodomain and extra terminal domain bet family brd4 regulates cell growth and cell cycle-related gene transcription through combining with acetylated histones when suffering from virus infection brd4 plays a role in epithelial-driven and nf-b dependent innate inflammation nf-b recruits brd4 and facilitates the interaction between nf-b and brd4 activates nf-b mediated pro-inflammatory signaling pathway moreover brd4 inhibitors was shown to d decrease the recruitment of macrophages and the infiltration of t cells15 previous researches have indicated the potential role of brd4 inhibition in both antiviral response through dna damage manner to block the attachment of dna and rna16 as well as in alleviating the lung fibrosis one of the common sequelae of covid-19 in animal models and ex vivo experiments17 furthermore recent reports demonstrated the transmembrane e protein of sars-cov-2 resident on ergic and golgi membranes could bound to brd418 bet inhibitors like apabetalone rvx-208 and jq-1 inhibit vascular inflammation-related gene expression through suppressing bet-mediated transcription triggered by multiple pro-inflammatory stimuli by doing so bet inhibitors have many reported effects in inflammation airway remodeling cardiovascular disease and cancers19 though there is no reported cases of covid-19 who have been treated with brd4 inhibitors to date brd4 inhibitors could be considered as a potential candidate to ameliorate hyperinflammation and cytokine storm accompanying covid-19the pathophysiology of severe covid-1920 is related to aggressive inflammatory responses and damage to the lung and even ripple effects across the body thus the severity depends on the balance between the viral virulence and the host immune response when the infection occurs the release and recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps then trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involving il-1 il-6 il-18 tnf- and macrophage inflammatory proteins normally a healthy immune response will clear the infection while an inadequate immune response will result in further accumulation of activated immune cells in the lungs leading to a cytokine storm and eventually damaging the lung or causing multiple organ failure through circulation therefore one strategy for the treatment against covid-19 is to block the overwhelming inflammation emerging evidence has suggested the potential effects of inflammation inhibitors on the treatment for covid-19 especially in severe cases further immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies aimed at curbing immune mediated damage in covid-19 are ongoing supplemental table it is necessary to confirm the therapeutic effects investigate the administration timing and clarify the mechanism all of which may render it possible for immunoregulation interventions to arrest or reverse the devastating diseasenone

majority of the people infected with 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov may recover without requiring special treatment 4 except the elderly people and those with some medical problems such as hypertension diabetes 5 and chronic respiratory disease 6 such patients are more liable to be infected with covid-19 and might develop a fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling that caused by the previous beta-coronavirus sars-cov appeared in 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 7in such cohort patients firstly complain of fever dry cough and at late stage may suffer from dyspnea that makes them in a desperate need of intensive care unit icu admission and oxygen therapy 8 however the time between icu admission and ards development is recorded to be as short as 2 days 9 being the reason for the high mortality rate associated with covid-19 at this stage 10till present no covid-19-specific vaccines or medications are available although some national medical authorities recommend testing the efficacy of antiviral medication in especially sever clinical trials 11 in addition several medical researchers suggest starting the supportive and symptomatic treatment till the new medications are developed 12 13early evidences have shown that the pathogenicity for covid-19 may be enhanced with increased the body susceptibility to induce a phenomenon called cytokine storm in which the immune system gears up by overreacting and producing more inflammatory mediators to fight the infection 14 as a result a severe inflammatory reaction is produced accompanied with significant damage including organ failure 15 16in view of cytokines storm caused by covid-19 infection high amounts of proinflammatory cytokines eg il-1 il-6 tnf- vegf gm-csf and mcp-1 are detected 10 probably leading to associated pulmonary inflammation that can drive fibrosis in the injured tissues 17in addition to the dysregulated lung inflammation emerging research and clinical studies increasingly indicate an alternative point of view for covid-19 pathogenesis they suggest that extreme lung tissue injury in covid-19 may be attributed to vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with subsequent activation accumulation of platelets and then thrombus formation at the injured site 18 19 developing a stroke which is suggested to be the leading cause of death in-between sever covid-19 cases 20lymphocytopenia a common striking finding in acute infections is suggested to be a significant indicator of covid-19 severity 16 however this decrease in lymphocytes count is noticed in both severe and non-severe covid-19 patients 21 expecting that there may be another critical factor driving the development and deterioration of the disease the most supportive observation now is the disclosure of higher neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio nlr in covid-19 severe patients than others 22 moreover covid-19 patients laboratory examinations recently show thrombocytopenia indicating the association of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio plr with covid-19 progression and prognosis 23given that the pulmonary tissue damage and microvascular injury recorded in covid-19 patients is mainly caused by uncontrolled inflammatory reactions and its associated pro-thrombotic conditions inhibiting the release of underlying inflammatory cytokines may be of great importance 24 hence many studies targeted the utilization of some immunomodulatory agents including hydroxy chloroquine and corticosteroids as covid-19 therapies to minimize the disease severity 22 however that therapeutic direction may interfere with the body immune system to efficiently act as a defense weapon against any other infections 25 26simultaneously many studies emphasized on the exploitation of covid-19 virus to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 found on the host pulmonary system as entry receptors 27 disrupting of course the normal physiological function of ace-2ang 17masr axis of the reninangiotensin system ras pathway 28therefore researchers suggested that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis andor angiotensin receptor blockers arbs may show a positive trend towards the severe inflammatory reactions and endothelial dysfunction caused by stimulating the function of aceang iiat-1 axis and thereby towards the bad pulmonary effects associated with the covid-19 infection 29 30 however no clinical trial till this time has been proved its efficacy in preventing or even reducing the covid-19 severity 31 32pursuing clinical trials with the absence of whole data describing the structure of covid-19 virus and its related mechanisms may lead to unsatisfied outcomes as well understanding such data will greatly help in determining the most appropriate effective treatment protocols consequently the first step to prevent and slow down the disease progression should involve the deduction of proper pathophysiology of that novel viral diseaseidentifying ace-2 as a viral entry receptor will emphasize on the important role of classical ras pathway in covid-19 pathophysiology however neither the link between ace-2 and other ras components nor their exact roles in the covid-19 pathogenesis have been neatly studied till nowone ras component namely neprilysin nep has been established to potentiate the physiological beneficial role ascribed to the ace-2ang 17masr axis by an alternative pathway 33 nowadays nep has emerged as a pharmaceutical target for many drugs especially those used in treating cardiovascular diseases and alzheimers disease ad 34 35considering the respiratory system nep was reported to play a vital role in protecting lungs from inflammation and fibrosis 36 37 38 a long time ago borson et al1989 mentioned that rats infected with common respiratory tract pathogens such as parainfluenza virus type-1 rat coronavirus and mycoplasma pulmonis showed low nep activity resulting in an increase in their susceptibility to inflammatory responses 39 however the precise neps role against life-threatening lung injuries has not been investigated yetconsequently this current review aims to examine the cellular signaling pathways involving nep in covid-19 pathogenesis and to summarize the evidences supporting the potential beneficial effects of nep as a novel target for therapyall previous and recent studies agreed with the fact that the surface of all human pathogenic coronaviruses is covered with crown like projections called spike s glycoproteins giving the viruses their name 40 in addition to s protein another three main structural proteins have been recognized in sars-cov-2 namely envelope e nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins 41 figure 1specifically s proteins are very important for sars-cov-2 infection to get started 42 they possess two functional subunits by which the virus can enter into its target host cells involving s1 subunit which enables it to bind with receptors on the host cell surface and s2 subunit that allows the virus to fuse into the cellular membrane 43unlike other coronaviruses several experimental analyses proved that sars-cov-2 does not use the common known viral entry receptors such as aminopeptidase n apn 41 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 44 but instead can utilize ace-2 receptor 27additionally it was revealed that transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 is very critical for the host cell entry of sars-cov-2 45 and its plasma membrane fusion 46 resembling sars-cov 47 firstly the virus starts its destructive journey with binding of s1 subunit to ace-2 enzyme receptor on the cell membrane surface which in turn activates tmprss2 activation of tmprss2 is followed by cleavage of both viruss s1 subunits from its s2 subunits and so of the ace-2 receptors secondly activated tmprss2 can also act on the s2 subunit activating it through prompting an irreversible conformational change that will facilitate the virus-cell fusion 48 49within this view understanding the precise involvement ace-2 as a member of pulmonary ras pathway in covid-19 pathophysiology may open new therapeutic possibilities for managementfor years ras was depicted as a hormonal circulating system involved in fluid and electrolyte balance systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure regulation 50 51 however a wealth of data showed that lung epithelial cells fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages could also express the major constituents of the ras 52 53 supporting the existence of a local pulmonary ras that can be differentiated from the systemic circulating ras 54as regards local ras in the lung it has been reported to involve multiple cellular mechanisms affecting the vascular permeability fibroblast activity and alveolar epithelial cells 55 56 by the time it is well recognized that activating pulmonary ras can influence the pathogenesis of lung injury in different lung diseases such as pulmonary hypertension acute respiratory distress syndrome ards asthma and pulmonary fibrosis 54 as a consequence pulmonary ras has been described to participate in disease process or play a protective role against tissue injury 57 and thus modulating ras in the lung can successfully play a good role in the treatment of inflammatory lung disease 52 58the functional steps of ras was firstly initiated by hepatic synthesis of a plasma globulin called renin substrate or angiotensinogen which could be enzymatically converted through renin secreted by juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney into the biologically inactive decapeptide namely angiotensin ang i 59 subsequently ras exhibits two main axes based on two distinct enzymes responsible for cleavage of ang i into angiotensin ang ii or ang 1-7 51 figure 2first axis involves generation of ang ii as the main effector via the angiotensin converting enzyme ace and named the classical vasopressor axis ace ang ii ang ii type 1 receptor at1 60 for the second axis angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace-2 was identified as a depressor for ras activation through producing ang 1-7 61 henceforth this axis ace-2 ang 1-7 mas-1 has become an important area of scientific research interest 62the aceang iiat-1 axis has been well documented to drive a set of deleterious reactions in the lung through generating ang ii the principal effector of this classical axis involved in ras mediated vasoconstriction sodium retention fluid overload inflammation and fibrosis 63 64 in addition ace has been reported to evoke bradykinin and substance p degradation two local pro-inflammatory and protussive peptides which can stimulate cough reflex and nitric oxide no release 65 66specifically pulmonary vascular inflammation contributes to a phenomenon called ace shedding in which endothelial surface-bound ace is released into the interstitium resulting in significant increase in the level of ang ii 67 which explains the detection of higher ang ii level in covid-19 patients than normal 68several studies declared that ang ii could act through two distinct g protein-coupled receptors gpcr subtypes angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r and type 2 at2r that were found to be expressed in human lung tissue proving the local generation of ang ii in lung 65 69the majority of actions evolved by ang ii could be mediated by at1 receptor via enhancing many complex intracellular signaling pathways including mapkerk plcbip3diacylglycerol tyrosine kinases and nf-kb 70 activating at1 receptor had been shown to further stimulate monocytes macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells to produce the proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 71 72 73 on the contrary at2 receptor was documented to have a number of counterregulatory interactions against lung tissue injury via inhibiting inflammation and fibrosis 74 75in addition to the known ang ii effects on promoting vasoconstriction and pro- inflammatory cytokine release there is also an increasing evidence that ang ii could induce vascular endothelial dysfunction 76 77 promoting the activation and aggregation of platelets and thereby pro-thrombotic milieu 78ang ii could be associated with noticeable rise in the plasma level of endothelin-1 et-1 79 which is a peptide secreted mainly from vascular endothelial cells ecs and basically works through the endothelin type a receptor eta in vascular smooth muscle cells and the endothelin type b receptor etb in ecs 80 consequently et-1 is described as the most potent bronchoconstrictor 81 and vasoconstrictor in the airways 82 practically et-1 acts as a key player of angiotensin ii-induced endothelial dysfunction and platelets activation via inducing il-6 release 83 84 which was documented to be correlated directly with the extent of endothelial dysfunction 85endothelial dysfunction is generally characterized by an imbalance between endothelium-dependent relaxing and contracting factors attributed to reduced productionavailability of nitric oxide no namely endothelium-derived relaxing factor edrf 86 87 no acts as a potent endogenous vasodilator that could prevent platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion to ecs 88 89 since il-6 would inactivate endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos it could disrupt no production 90 decreasing its level and inducing a state of oxidative stress that may lead to ang ii-induced impairment in endothelial responses 91
postulating impaired endothelium functions as a principal factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure hypertension and diabetes it will be expected to classify the patients of such diseases as high risk groups for covid-19 development 92 93 94furthermore platelets activation and aggregation may be noticed as a result of inflammatory reactions aggravated by endothelial dysfunction leading to imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis 87 it is clearly evident that continuing release of il-6 can enhance hepatic thrombopoietin tpo mrna expression resulting in thrombopoiesis stimulation and increase in circulatory platelets numbers known as inflammatory thrombocytosis within this context et-1 can also mediate the synthesis of platelet activating factor paf a potent phospholipid mediator of platelet activation and aggregation that may activate platelets to stick together and aggregate as a result a platelet plug is formed as an initiator for blood clotting and intravascular thrombus formation 88 89 which is considered as a starting point for developing stroke 95even though the high incidence of inflammatory thrombocytosis in covid-19 patients the laboratory results of severe cases showed the opposite suffering from thrombocytopenia 23the possible explanation is the depletion of both platelets and megakaryocytes as a result of multiple blood clots formed at the injured site leading to less platelet production with more consumption as the disease severity increases 96interestingly endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation can successively together worsen the severity of covid-19 infection as known both et-1 and activated platelets associated with endothelial dysfunction 97 could promote leukocytes rolling adherence to endothelium activation and migration into the inflammatory sites sharing in enhancement of leukocytes recruitment 98 99 in addition endothelial dysfunction can drive the fibrotic consequences following sars-cov-2 infection developing pulmonary fibrosis as a result of releasing transforming growth factor- 1 tgf-1 the main fibrogenic cytokines implicated in pulmonary fibrosis which could be induced by et-1 action 100 101taken into consideration the numerous harmful effects possibly induced by ang ii during covid-19 pathogenesis we found that most novel studies aim to use the anti-hypertensive drugs which act either by inhibiting the ace activity or by blocking at1 receptor suggesting that action may mitigate the disease severity in covid-19 patientson the other side it has been proposed that enhancing the counter regulatory axis composed by ace-2ang 1-7masr axis may be the most helpfulace-2ang 1-7masr axis the depressor arm of ras was identified to mitigate the deleterious actions mediated by ace ang ii at1 51 within this axis ace-2 competes with ace by hydrolyzing ang i into the nonapeptide angiotensin ang 1-9 which is further cleaved by the action of ace into heptapeptide angiotensin ang 1-7 thus decreasing the amount of ang i available for ang ii generation by ace 102 103 to the same extent ace-2 could also hydrolyze ang ii converting it into ang 17 104 105until the year 2000 ace has emerged as the key enzyme in the pulmonary ras but this was challenged by the discovery of its homologue ace-2 106 which was found out to be broadly expressed in almost all types of lung cells within the vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells types i and ii alveolar epithelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells 107 108ace-2 could negatively regulate the ras in the lung through reducing ang iiat1 receptor signaling and activating the counterregulatory ang 1-7 mas receptor pathway 54 that finding was compatible with the animal studies showed that the use of ras inhibitors could effectively relieve the symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure 109 consequently the increased ace-2 was addressed as a target for protection from predisposition to inflammatory lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 108 110concerning covid-19 pathogenesis binding of sars-cov-2 to ace-2 resulted in exhaustion of ace-2 breaking the balance of the ras system within the lung and then exacerbation of pulmonary inflammatory reactions 109 111being ace-2 receptors widely expressed on vascular endothelial cells ec within the lungs 112 sars-cov-2 can exploit them to induce and diffuse inflammatory cascades within endothelial cells disrupting their function evidenced by the existence of viral elements and inflammatory cells within endothelial cells 113thus distributing ace-2 as the main functional receptor for sars-cov-2 within human tissues will be the determinator for spreading of viral infection within the lung and other organs 108 114 both alveolar and bronchial membranes were reported to highly express ace-2  which may explain the higher tendency of sars-cov-2 virus to harmfully affect lower airways than the upper ones 110 115 however recent reports indicate that few covid-19 patients may also develop some signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection eg rhinorrhea sneezing or sore throat 7 17 116furthermore it was reported that ace-2 is also expressed in many epithelial cells of other organs than lung including kidney blood vessels intestine 110 and brain 117 the fact which may explain the existence of some extra-pulmonary co-morbidities as myocardial dysfunction 30 and acute kidney injury aki 118 gastrointestinal manifestations diarrhea vomiting or abdominal pain 119 neurologic manifestations altered mental status or seizures 120 121therefore increased ace-2 may be useless by promoting viral entry into lung cells potentiating its devastating effect and enhancing mortality 122 consistent with these findings suggesting ace-2 activators such as diminazene aceturate dize 65 4-2-4-carbamimidoyl phenyl imino hydrazinyl benzene carboximidamide and xanthenone xnt 54 for counteracting covid-19 pathogenesis will be in vainas a consequence in order to diminish sars-cov-2 entry and its subsequent lung injury pulmonary ace-2 activity should be reduced however at the same time reduced ace-2 activity may contribute to worsening of the lung inflammation by unopposed angiotensin ii accumulation 31 and forcing the ras to continuously increase the expression of cytokines 123simultaneously a previous data indicated that the decrease in the ace-2 activity in a rat model of ards was paralleled by low amounts of ang-17 124 which has been reported to play a beneficial role against pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis 125 126 in this context another study stated that treatment with protease-resistant a cyclic form of ang 17 cang 17 could restore the ace-2 activity attenuated the inflammatory response decreased lung injury and improved lung function 124 127 that confirms the positive relationship between ang 1-7 and preserving the depressor role of ace-2ang 1-7masr axis in pulmonary ras hence these data will attract the attention to the pivotal role of ang 17 in covid-19 pathophysiology and therapyang 17 is a biologically active metabolite of the ras that had become a peptide of interest in the last decade because of its effective role in activating a number of crucial events for the homeostasis of normal physiological functions 128 it was reported that ang 17 could exert various effects which are greatly in opposition to those of at-1 receptor activation such as vasodilator anti-inflammatory anti-hypertrophy anti-proliferative anti-fibrosis and antioxidant effects 54 129clinical and epidemiological studies have revealed the existence of a powerful link between the vasodilator effect of ang 1-7 and its higher plasma levels in females making them less liability to hypertension than males 130 131 several mechanisms have been attributed to ang 1-7 in lowering blood pressure which can be explained as follows i triggering enos to stimulate the release of no which could play a critical role in promoting the relaxation of blood vessels and inhibiting the platelet aggregation 132 133 ii inducing natriuresisdiuresis 134 and iii activating peroxisome proliferator activator receptors ppars which in turn supports the availability of no 135interestingly ang 1-7 was documented to directly blunt the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways induced by the ang ii-associated phosphorylation of mapks and nf-kb signaling 136 137 suggesting also the anti-hypertrophic effects of ang 1-7 through normalization of mapks activity 130 moreover ang 1-7 by counteracting the ang ii effects could also preserve the endothelial function through increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and inhibiting oxidative stress 138taken together ang 1-7 could also reduce lung injury by suppressing the expression of fibrogenic molecules such as tgf-1139 which acts as a key mediator involved in pulmonary fibrosis 140moreover several researches have pointed out the antioxidant role of ang 1-7 54 130 that might be established by i limiting the activation of nadph oxidase which is a membrane-bound enzyme complex involved in triggering ros production through generating superoxide radicals 141 andor ii normalizing the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and heme oxygenase-1 ho-1 130 as well as the nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor 2 nrf2 that acts as an emerging regulator of cellular resistance to oxidants 142other observation and experimental evidence suggested that endogenous aceis effects of ang 17 can be mediated by its unique membrane bound g protein-coupled receptor known as mas masr 143 which was revealed to be found in the thin areas of the bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle 144 masr could direct the ang 1-7 biological responses via the masrcampprotein kinase a pka signaling 145 which was previously validated by administrating ave 0991 a nonpeptide mimetic of ang 1-7 as a specific ligand agonist for masr 130subsequently attention should be drawn to specifically trigger the ang 1-7 as a potential therapeutic agent able to mitigate the lung injury in patients with covid-19 infection without increasing ace-2 activitythere are different formulations of ang 1-7 are being developed eg ave-0991 146 hpcdang 1-7 147 cgen-856 148 norleu3-a 149 and cyclic ang 1-7 150 and used to demonstrate its therapeutic potential in numerous animal models of human diseases including hypertension heart failure stroke diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis renal disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension 130 145 151 however therapeutic attempts and clinical trials are still underway because of ang 17 rapid in vivo degradation by ace 130on the other hand previous studies emphasized that ang 17 could induce vasodilatation in rats of mas-deficient vessels 152 and in rats pretreated with a779 masr blocker 153 the former observed data suggested that ang 17 might also interact with an additional specific receptor other than masr to elicit vasodilatation 154 indeed ang 17 have been shown to stimulate also the bradykinin bks pathway via preventing the bk hydrolysis 155bks are one of the formed kinins that can play significant roles in regulating tissue injury inflammatory responses and vascular permeability 156 they have a little direct impact on the activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells but they could work indirectly through stimulating the airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts through producing a wide array of cytokines including il-6 il-1 il-8 granulocyte colony stimulating factor g-csf gm-csf and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 157 158 159 160 bk action was mediated by g-coupled receptors namely bk receptor br 156 that amazingly found to be interacted with the mas receptors in order to regulate the vasodilator effect of the ang 1-7 161at the same time it was found that the reduction in ace-2 mrna expression within the lungs of stz diabetic rats was linked with an increase in circulating ang ii but without any significant change in the production of ang 17 162 163 ensuring that pulmonary ace-2 was not the only enzyme responsible for ang 17 production but there might be another enzyme contributing to its synthesisby the time the classical view of ras has been further expanded and become well established than previously conceived as a consequence it was discovered that there was another alternative pathway by which ang 1-7 is produced instead of that based on ace-2 that way was disclosed to degrade ang i directly into ang 1-7 by another ras member called nepnep neutral endopeptidase or neprilysin previously known as cd10 is a member of transmembrane zink-metalloendopeptidase that particularly highly expressed in both kidney and lung 164 165 166 nep was also found in a number of other tissues as epithelia of breast prostate stomach and in the central nervous system 167 168 169 nep had been also shown to be present in a soluble circulating form cnep within several body fluids including urine cerebrospinal fluid and plasma 170although nep can discriminately hydrolyze a broad spectrum of physiologically relevant substrates it was found to possess an obvious substrate specificity classically nep exhibits a size-related specificity that enables it to hydrolyze only peptides with a small molecular weight generally at or below 3000 dalton 171 as well nep has been also described to show a distinction between substrates being cleaved in vitro and that being cleaved in vivo initially nep was reported to specifically cleave more than 7 peptides in vivo including natriuretic peptides nps atrial natriuretic peptide anp c-type natriuretic peptide cnp and b-type natriuretic peptide bnp bks neuropeptides substance p enkephalins gastrin chemotactic peptide formyl-met-leu-phe fmlp versus 26 peptides in vitro such as il-l oxytocin gastrin-releasing peptide grp et-1 ang i and iietc 172 173 174 by time more substrates had been proposed with varying levels of in vitro andor in vivo proof of cleavage among that grp et-1 ang i which have been proved to be additionally metabolized in vivo by nep 162 175 176 emerging the evidence that nep could play an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions 177 table 2
for cvs patients nps were known to be of therapeutic importance in lowering blood volume by inducing natriuresis in which excess sodium can be excreted in urine with accompanying water by the renal tubules 35 previous clinitcal trials proved that administering synthetic nps might be associated with some limitations especially on the long run 178 179 that pushed them to depend on using neprilysin inhibitors nepi such as thiorphan or candoxatrilat to prolong and potentiate the beneficial effects of vasoactivenps via inhibiting endogenous nps degradation 180nepi have been used for decades to treat acute diarrhea 181 however they are now developed and emerged as a pharmaceutical target for different cvs diseases nepi have been used mainly in people with congestive heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction lvef 182 however using nepi eg candoxatril solely for hypertension treatment was ineffective because nepi could inhibit ang ii degradation increasing its associated simultaneous detrimental effects therefore combining nepi either with acei eg omapatrilat or arbs eg lcz696 become a necessity to overcome this limitation 183 184another critical aspect for the pharmacological role of nepi was achieved in treating diabetes via inhibiting the breakdown of some substrates known to modulate glucose metabolism such as incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 nps and bks 185within the brain nep had also proved to hold a great beneficial role in the neurological disorders such as alzheimers disease ad on both in vitro and in vivo studies 186 187 188 multiple lines of evidence highlighted the presence of many amyloid plaques in the form of -amyloid a peptide in the brains of ad patients with dementia 189 it was worthy mentioned that nep was one of the major a peptide-degrading enzymes in the brain whose expression was documented to be lower in the brain of ad patients 190 supporting the role that nep can play in the prevention and treatment of adin addition to the above mentioned nep seems to play a protective role in the pathogenesis of lung injury since significant decrease in the nep enzymatic activity in the lung of mice with ali was associated with inactivation of the tachykinins degradation pathway and consequently reducing uncontrolled inflammation in aliards and in other neurogenic respiratory diseases 37 191 192lung inflammation could induce hyperplasia in the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells pnecs of both respiratory bronchioles and alveoli 193 194 resulting in excessive production of grp 195grp was known to be one of the bombesin-like peptides that can be expressed and released by pnecs into the surrounding airway parenchyma in response to various stimuli like hypoxia or irritation 196 197 to regulate the neutrophil chemotaxis and macrophage infiltration within the lung tissue 198 199 grp could act via stimulating gastrin-releasing peptide receptor grpr at the surface of macrophages which in turn would enhance the release of early inflammatory mediators contributing to the recruitment of neutrophils 200 201more neutrophil infiltration within the lung is usually associated with high tendency for lung tissue damage 202 203 since they would be involved in breakdown of basement membrane integrity within the bronchiolaralveolar architecture and thereby diminution of pulmonary function moreover during the deleterious inflammatory reactions as in pneumonia neutrophil lifespan is prolonged to generate more superoxide radicals resulting in damage of the surrounding normal tissue 204interestingly nep can play a vital role during lung inflammation through its catabolic effect on grp 205 in addition to its presence on the plasma membrane of neutrophils modulating their chemotactic responsiveness via cleaving the chemotactic peptide formyl-met-leu-phe fmlp which resembles an effective chemotactic agonist in response to grp 206 207 thus breaking both grb and fmlp peptide by nep will cut the way for recruiting more neutrophils into site of injury and consequently grab the reinson the other hand once neutrophils being activated at inflammatory sites they could secrete high concentration of several serine proteases into the extracellular environment to degrade host pathogens recruit more cytokines and stimulate further tissue damage 208 209 cathepsin g was reported to be one of the neutrophil-derived serine proteases that is abundantly found in the azurophil granules and known to degrade both angiotensinogen and ang i into ang ii 209 210so far nep can additionally take a part in decreasing the pro-inflammatory oxidative and pro-fibrotic effects of ang ii by minimizing the release of cathepsin g and consequently its action on ang i 211 212 213as nep was reported to have more catalytic activity than ace-2 in cleaving ang i into ang 17 it could also effectively enhance the protective activities associated with ang 1-7 in the lung 214 as well nep could not affect lung ang 1-7 metabolism because it was involved in the metabolism of ang 1-7 within tissues other than pulmonary tissues as renal cortex on the other hand ace was recorded to be the major enzyme responsible for ang 1-7 metabolism in the pulmonary membranes by hydrolyzing it to ang 1-5 and then into ang 3-5 by the action of aminopeptidases 215 besides nep shows higher activity than ace towards bks degradation resulting in inhibition of the bradykinin-induced inflammatory cells influx 125 216despite multiple data confirming the expected role of nep in relieving the pulmonary inflammatory response its effect on reducing exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia in covid 19 patients has not been highlighted yethence the question now may the reviewed actions of nep pathways be sufficient to impose a new effective strategy for covid-19 management as compared to the suggested repurposed drugsrecently there is an empirical use of anti-inflammation therapy in critical patients of covid-19 presented with severe complications in order to prevent further injury and suppress cytokine storm manifestations as ards and other organs damage till even death main anti-inflammatory medications include non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids corticosteroids chloroquine and statins 22 table 2
numerous observational data support a strong association between use of nsaids in management of lower respiratory tract infections and higher incidence of complications including fulminating pneumonia pleural effusions and dissemination of infection 218 nsaids may also induce nephrotoxicity among susceptible covid-19 patient groups and is exacerbated by fever and dehydration 219 consequently some studies recommend avoiding use of nsaids eg ibuprofen and diclofenac as the first choice for fever control and pain symptoms in covid-19 infection and using paracetamol instead 220 221previous study demonstrated that corticosteroids-treated asthmatic patients showed enhanced nep expression in their airway epithelium as compared to nonsteroid-treated ones this fits the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids within the airways may be partially mediated by upregulating nep 222despite of possible benefits gained from the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids they will be associated with serious impairment in the immune system of severe covid-19 cases 22 corticosteroids may delay the viral elimination and increase susceptibility for the secondary infection resulting in deterioration of the disease especially with immune system impairment 223 other side effects associated with corticosteroid treatment include hyperglycemia central obesity and hypertension which represent an obstacle against their use in people at higher risk for covid-19 especially diabetic cardiac and hypertensive patients 217auyeung et al 2005 reported that there is no survival benefit for treatment of sars patients with corticosteroids 224 another study on corticosteroid therapy of mers patients has revealed no mortality difference with delayed clearance of mers-cov from lower respiratory tract 225 moreover there is no evidence from any clinical trials supporting its administration for covid-19 22in order to overcome the immune suppression induced by corticosteroids a variety of other therapies have been developed to act directly as specific anti-cytokines eg anakinra or tocilizumab 10 or anti-inflammatory cytokines eg il-37 or il-38 17 without targeting the immune system and have proven to be effective in treating several syndromes that triggered by cytokine storm 123according to previous studies chloroquine cq and its less toxic metabolite hydroxychloroquine hcq possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory benefits by affecting cell signaling in viral infections cqhcq also exhibit a wide variety of antiviral reactions against several viruses including members of the flaviviruses retroviruses and coronaviruses 25cq and hcq can prevent the attachment of viral particles to their cell surface receptor modulate ph in order to inhibit ph-dependent steps of viral replication or interfere with post-translational modifications ptms of viral proteins 217 226an enough pre-clinical evidence considering cq effectiveness for treatment of covid-19 showed reduction in the pneumonia exacerbation improving lung imaging findings and high rate of virus nucleic acid test negativity accordingly cq phosphate in guidelines version 6 for treatment of covid-19 has been recommended with oral administration twice daily at a dose of 500 mg 300 mg for chloroquine for adults and no more than 10 days 22however there is a narrow margin between cqhcq therapeutic and toxic dose its poisoning has been favored and life-threatening in patients with cardiac disorders 227 it is also contraindicated for people with retinopathy elevated liver enzymes heart rhythm disorders as qt prolongation or allergy to cqhcq 228 further efficiency and safety of cqhcq for covid-19 is still unclear and needs a confirmation depending on more preclinical and clinical trials 229
statins are the widely used cholesterol lowering drugs that were also reported to improve endothelial functions via lipid-independent mechanisms mediated by their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties as well as their ability to restore vascular no bioavailability 230 because of their immunomodulatory effect they have also proven to be beneficial as adjuvant therapy in patients with different auto-immune inflammatory conditions eg systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 231 as a consequence some hospitals included statins in the treatment protocol of covid-19 although statin therapy is usually well tolerated their use in covid-19 patients may increase the incidence and severity of myopathies and acute kidney injury 232 moreover statin drugs may increase il-18 levels which can promote severe pneumonia deteriorating sars-cov-2induced ards and mortality especially in elderly patients who are more likely to use these drugs 233sex differences in health outcomes following covid-19 may be attributed to sex-dependent production of steroid hormones estrogen has been reported to attenuate inflammation which might protect women compared to men 234 estrogen signaling are also known to downregulate mcp-1 expression and promote adaptive t cell response by stimulating neutrophil recruitment 235it has been also reported that serms like toremifene exhibits potential effects in blocking various viral infections as sarscov and merscov virus 236 through interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein resulting in inhibition of its replication 237
wang et al 2020 suggests that treatment with estrogens and estrogen-related compounds as estradiol e2 could suppress the expression of tmprss2 in the lung resulting in decreased mortality to sars-cov infection 235an estrogen receptorsras interaction has been demonstrated in several studies e2 was detected to drive ras to increase ang-1-7 production through estrogen receptor er  mediated stimulation of ace1 and ace2 mrna expression and activity a sex difference has been revealed in the expression of ras components 238there is a controversy about the role of ras blockers including ace inhibitors andor angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers arbs in treating covid-19 and their exact roles still remain unclear 28 32 239their use has been suggested to be of a value through increasing ace-2 that may have a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury by preserving ace-2 in competition with sars-cov-2 entry into the cells 28 another mechanism by which ace-2 can prevent lung damage and attenuate the pulmonary fibrosis will be via enhancing the ace-2ang-1-7mas axis to increase the production of ang 17 which in turn can counteract the activity of the aceangiiat1r axis 137on the other hand it was known that ace inhibitors could block the breakdown of bradykinin increasing its level and then promoting its associated inflammatory reactions resulting in more deterioration in the health state 240 additionally it has been expected that patients receiving arbs may show upregulation in the membrane bound ace-2 facilitating the coronavirus entry and worsen then its course 241the suggested explanation may be attributed to the increase in angiotensin ii level that probably pushes it to act as an increased substrate loaded on the ace enzyme resulting in shifting a part of ang ii to be converted by the action of ace2 into ang 1-7 that may be associated with ace-2 upregulation 32other agents acting on the ras such as beta-blockers and direct renin inhibitors dri to lower angi formation and thereby angii and ang 1-7 however till now no one discussed their impact on the severity and prognosis of covid-19 28on the contrary lacking ang 1-7 will be of negative effect on lung health so there is an urgent need to suppose a pathway that can ensure the increase of ang 1-7 level without upregulating ace-2 that effect may be attained by keeping ace activity to enhance the pulmonary metabolism of ang 1-7 and at the same time shifting the ras system away from aceang iiat-1 axis to avoid its associated inflammatory and oxidative activities we suggest that nep may achieve this complicated equationbased on previous literature that addressed several beneficial and protective effects displayed by nep during lung injury we postulate that increasing nep activity may mitigate covid-19 pathogenesis lung of covid-19 patients showed pneumocyte hyperplasia with inflammatory cellular infiltration 242 confirming the release of excessive grp into the surrounding airway parenchyma as a result of pnecs hyperplasia 193 194 196 197considering the documented links between high grp level and both neutrophil chemotaxis and infiltration as well as reduction in food and water intake 243 it is not surprising to detect high neutrophil count 244 and anorexia in severe covid-19 patients 245thus we expect that grp is the first spark in initiating neutrophils recruitment as well as cytokine storm which are the main pillars in covid-19 pathophysiology our suggested hypothesis herein depends on two main aspects figure 3nep may abrogate grp-induced neutrophil chemotaxis via cleaving grp and degrading fmlp peptide that can modulate the chemotactic responsiveness of neutrophils on the other aspect nep may withstand the potent cytokine storm which was prescribed to be one of causes for lung damage progression and death in covid-19 patientswe suggest that nep can diminish the release of inflammatory cytokines that may increase sensitivity of target cells for further stimulation by sara-co-2 virus 246 247 thus nep can improve lung histopathology and enhance tissue survival through two mechanismsfirstly interfering with ang ii formation via preventing the proteolytic cleavage of angiotensinogen and ang i into ang ii by neutrophil-derived cathepsin g 209 210 211 that is expected to be released continuously in response to uncontrolled neutrophil activation associated with covid-19 patients and via regenerating the synthesis of endogenous ang 1-7 expected to be minimized because of ace-2 exhaustion by sara-co-2 virus 109 ang 1-7 by itself may protect against pulmonary fibrosis through reducing tgf-1 expression 139secondly breaking bks and thereby inhibiting its role in activation and recruitment of the inflammatory cellshowever recorded findings suggest that lung damage caused by covid-19 is induced by an alternative mechanism rather than hyperinfammatory injury it likely seems that endothelial activation and associated pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy are the contributing factors in covid-19 pathogenesis 18within this context nep may exert a critical role in suppressing et-1 that mediates angiotensin ii-induced endothelial and platelets dysfunction yet nep may minimize the chance for ang ii formation which was reported to be a potent stimulator of et-1 in endothelial cells 248 even nep can additionally degrades et-1 preventing its associated inflammatory injury and eventual fibrotic cascade in the lung 81 175furthermore we speculate that nep may be helpful in dealing with individuals at high risk groups for covid-19 that exhibit many obstacles in their management nep may regulate blood pressure in cardiovascular and hypertensive patients indirectly via decreasing both blood and tissue levels of ang ii by i increasing ang i substrate availability a result of inhibiting cathepsin g-mediated neutrophil release and ii augmenting the rate of ang i conversion into ang 1-7 that previously reported to exert a stimulatory effect on anp secretion via masr 249for diabetic patients we demonstrate that nep may regulate pancreatic ras flux to improve glycemic conditions in response to nep-mediated degradation in vitro nep may evoke the insulin secretory ability of ang 17 via hydrolyzing it into the biologically active ang 12 dipeptide in pancreatic islets 33 250numerous in vivo and in vitro experiments have been made to increase nep expression one study speculated that dexamethasone could enhance nep expression in airway epithelial cells via promoting its transcription and synthesis 251 another prior finding demonstrated that valproic acid could reduce plaque formation and improve learning deficits via up-regulating nep in appps1 transgenic mice 252 recently serotonin and its derivatives were explored to ameliorate symptoms of ad induced in mouse via enhancing nep up-regulation 253several lines of evidence identified that hormones such as androgens 254 and estrogen 255 could also positively regulate nep expression suggesting that decline in levels of androgen or estrogen associated with aging would accompany by decrease in nep synthesis which may be an important factor for increasing the risk of covid-19 infection among elderlyon the other hand several findings investigated the up-regulating effect of some natural products on nep expression such as apigenin luteolin and curcumin --epigallocatechin-3-gallate as well as resveratrol 256 257 258 in china naoerkang nek a traditional chinese herbal medicine improved the ability of learning and memory in rats model of ad by increasing nep expression in their hippocampal tissues 259however some scientists aimed to produce recombinant nep r nep instead as park et al 2013 who prepared recombinant soluble nep from insect cells to be intracerebrally injected into ad mice 238therefore we finally suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed to increase nep expression andor activity may be of great benefit for prevention and treatment of covid-19despite the high widespread of covid-19 contagion worldwide there is no specific efficient treatment that has been proved till now several pharmacological interventions for covid-19 have been suggested targeting the hosts immune response following sars-cov-2 exposure there is an overproduction of grp within lung tissue resulting in increased release of inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 tnf- vegf gm-csf and mcp-1 such cytokines are widely known to enhance neutrophil infiltration which in turn induce lung inflammation and respiratory distress as reported in covid-19 infected patients as well cytokines release is also presumed to develop sars-cov-2 - associated pulmonary fibrosis novel findings define covid-19 as one of the pulmonary diseases associated with endothelial and platelets dysfunction now it is definitely known that viral invasion can be mediated by one of the ras signaling system components namely ace-2 hence covid-19 occurrence and progression can be attributed to imbalance in the pulmonary ras signaling resulting from sars-cov-2-induced ace-2 drain interestingly the decrease in ace-2 activity will be accompanied with a decrease in the generation of ang1-7 which was known to be the light side of ras regarding the data emphasized on the protective role of ang 1-7 in lung injury it may be recommended as a covid-19 therapy but because of its short half-life ang 1-7 exhibits a limitation for its use since nep is a more potent alternative way than ace-2 for producing ang1-7 it is suggested to assess the possible beneficial role of nep in covid-induced lung injury few studies have discussed nep-mediated protective pathways in experimental models of lung injury and fibrosis however its actual role as a lung protective therapy has not been yet recognized nep has been involved in degradation of many peptides that may be incorporated in covid-19 pathophysiology so we expect that nep can effectively interfere with the chemotactic responsiveness and recruitment of neutrophils by degrading both fmlp peptide and gpr respectively furthermore we suggest that nep can minimize cytokine storm associated with sars-cov-2 invasion through inhibiting ang ii formation by neutrophil-derived cathepsin g and directing ang i for generating ang 1-7 which can in turn suppress tgf-1 expression and its fibrogenic action protecting against fibrosis degrading both bks and et-1 by nep may be associated with low il-6 levels which will be beneficial for stabilizing endothelium and restoring its function in addition to its catabolic properties we postulate that nep may possess an advantage for covid-19 high risk patients through modulating blood pressure and glucose homeostasis practically numerous in-vivo and in-vitro experimental manipulations were made to upregulate nep expression either by using drugs dexamethasone and valproic acid hormones androgens and estrogen or natural substances apigenin luteolin curcumin and --epigallocatechin-3-gallate however others directed their efforts towards preparing the recombinant nep r nep because most pre-clinical and clinical studies within the medical field are interested in studying nep inhibitors there is a little data concerning use of nep as a therapeutic agent consequently its associated adverse effects have not yet been studied well finally we hope our hypothesis will be somewhat enough to direct a future work towards the therapeutic role of nep in modulating covid-19 pandemic and to target the subsequent therapies for enhancing nep activity in

260 261the immune dysregulation observed in covid- 19 clinically translates into a secondary hemophagocytic syndrome or lymphohistiocytosis acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure however multiple studies have indicated that immunosuppression with corticosteroids impairs the immune response to various respiratory viruses as it affects the induction of antiviral interferon ifn type i therefore the decision to immunosuppress a hospitalized patient with covid-19 due to the possible benefits of reducing inflammation must be carefully weighed against the potential deleterious effect of delaying virus clearance or promoting bacterial superinfection in addition to the adverse effects of immunosuppression therapy that further complicates the management of a hospitalized patient the use of systemic steroids may worsen lung injury which is particularly relevant in the case of treating patients with covid-19similar risks of perpetuating viral infection and bacterial or fungal superinfection must be considered when administering a drug that influences ifn-mediated signalling including jak inhibitors and interleukin il-6 blockers because the il-6r-jak-stat3 signalling pathway is an essential component of the type i ifn pathway moreover il-6 can play an essential role in initiating the response against virus infections by promoting viral clearance by neutrophils this was demonstrated in a study where deficiency of il-6 or il-6r in mice favoured the persistence of influenza infection leading to death in the experimental grouptherefore in the face of this global emergency that is witnessing rapid degeneration in patients clinical conditions toward more serious situations that can be overwhelming to primary physicians despite the best standards of care the opportunity to redirect medications offers an ethical and legal solution as medications outside of their usual indications can be prescribed as long as there is sufficient justification to do sohypothesiswe here propose the repositioning of pentoxifylline ptx in the treatment of covid-19 ptx is a phosphodiesterase pde inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp levels which in turn activate protein kinase pka leading to a reduction in the synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha tnf- ptx has also been shown to influence the renin-angiotensin system ras in vitro by inhibiting angiotensin 1 receptor at1r expression the effects of ptx on restoration of glutathione levels maintenance of mitochondrial viability inhibition of tnf- production and preservation of microvascular blood flow along with reports of improvement in endothelial function and coagulation have encouraged its use in the treatment of neonatal sepsis leading to a reduction in hospital stay and mortality moreover in the context of covid-19 ptx has shown evidence of improvement in experimental ards models
moreover since it is a short-lived drug the effect of ptx can be rapidly suppressed if severe adverse reactions arise due to excessive suppression of tnf- furthermore the rheological properties of ptx could be useful when faced with the atypical presentation of ards associated with covid-19 characterized by marked hypoxemia with preservation of the ventilatory mechanics this suggests that the loss of regulation of pulmonary perfusion and hypoxic vasoconstriction vasoplegia can be associated with microvascular obstructive inflammatory thrombus syndrome of the lungs ie microclotsoverall the rheological anti-inflammatory and renin-angiotensin axis properties of ptx highlight this drug as a therapeutic treatment alternative for patients with covid-19 which can help reduce the production of the inflammatory cytokines tnf- il-6 ifn- and il-17 and increase the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10ptx also favours restoring the balance of the immune response reducing damage to the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells improving circulation and avoiding microvascular thrombosis moreover ptx decreases the neutrophillymphocyte ratio and restores the ratio of tregth17 lymphocyte subpopulations ptx decreases c-reactive protein crp ferritin lactic dehydrogenase and d-dimer with consequent improvement in the ventilatory parameters pao2fio2 and sato2in view of this evidence it seems reasonable to reposition a drug with a proven safety profile and that is widely available as an alternative treatment of covid-19 to reduce inflammation without the trade-off of conventional immunosuppression moreover such repositioning avoids ethical or legal barriers allowing for immediate application in an acute settingthe sars-cov-2 spike protein spike s binds only to human angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 ace2 as a cell entry receptor 1 this interaction partially explains why the lung is the organ most vulnerable to infection with sars-cov-2 zhao et al 2 demonstrated that 83 of the cells in the healthy lung tissue expressing ace2 are type ii alveolar epithelial cells aecii cells suggesting that these cells can serve as a reservoir for viral infection moreover genetic analysis revealed that ace2-expressing aecii cells have high levels of regulatory genes related to multiple viral processes including the viral life cycle assembly and genome replication further supporting that ace2 expressed in aecii cells facilitates the replication of coronavirus in the lungs 2 similarly other extrapulmonary tissues including the heart kidney endothelium and intestine express ace2 3 4 5 6 7 this broad distribution ace2 tissue expression could partially explain the multiorgan dysfunction seen in patients with severe sars-cov infection 8 9 10compounding these effects the coupling of s protein to its cell-binding site of ace2 leads to the downregulation of ace2 resulting in excess production of angiotensin ang by angiotensin-converting enzyme ace the reduction in ace2 concentrations in turn decreases the production of the heptapeptide vasodilator or ang17 which contributes to lung injury since the stimulation of angiotensin type 1 receptors at1rs by ang ii increases the permeability of the pulmonary vasculature 11 12the ras plays an essential role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis as well as in fluid and electrolyte balance 13 14 15 whereas ace2 functions as a negative regulator of the ras 3 16 17 specifically ace cleaves the ang i decapeptide into the ang ii octapeptide 13 14 ace2 cleaves a single ang i residue to generate ang19 16 17 and a single ang ii residue to produce ang 17 17 thereby negatively regulating ras by inactivating ang ii 16imai et al 11 demonstrated that ang ii receptor subtypes are responsible for aceace2-regulated acute lung injury ali based on experiments of a mouse model with genetic loss of at1a receptor rat1a expression which showed markedly improved lung function and reduced oedema formation conversely inactivation of the at2 receptor rat2 was shown to aggravate ali 15 moreover they attempted to prevent ali in the ace2-knockout mice using rat1- and rat2-specific antagonists pharmacological inhibition of rat1 attenuated the severity of acid-induced lung injury whereas rat2 inhibition had no apparent effect on the phenotypes of ali in ace2 knockout mice 11 15 collectively these data show that ang iirat1a interactions play a role in the development and severity of ali 15 ace contributes to an increase in vascular permeability and a decrease in the survival of pneumocytes 18 at the same time ang ii is considered to function as a growth factor that regulates cell proliferationapoptosis and fibrosis as well as a mediator that attracts inflammatory cells to sites of tissue injury 19all of the evidence accumulated to date has led to the widely accepted belief that ang ii is the primary factor responsible for the exacerbation of lung tissue lesions through the activation of rat1 20 21 22 similarly ang ii exerts its fibrotic effects by inducing the production of transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-1 thereby triggering fibroblast proliferation and differentiation in collagen-secreting cells 23accordingly it would be reasonable to consider that dysregulation of the ras could partially explain the observations made by a group of doctors in italy that patients with covid-19 pneumonia who meet the berlin criteria of ards present an atypical form of ards the main characteristic of these patients was a dissociation between their relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia these doctors suggested that this disconnect may be explained by the loss of regulation of pulmonary perfusion and hypoxic vasoconstriction ie vasoplegia 24the obstructive inflammatory thrombus syndrome of the lungs that occurs in patients with covid-19 could offer another explanation for this atypical presentation of ards involving inflammation of the endothelial vascular lesions which may involve dysregulation of the ras ie microclots 25 that is the high concentration of ace2 in the endothelial cells of the arteries veins and arterial smooth muscle cells favour viral replication along with secondary cell damage consequently releasing alarmins that are generated during cell death thereby triggering the hosts innate immune response through various mechanisms including activation of complement via lectin and alveolar macrophages through tnf- and other mediators 25complement activation would not only cause direct endothelial damage but also participates in leukocyte recruitment through c3a and c5a formation leading to massive local production of the cytokines il-1 il-6 il-8 and ifn- along with this massive host immune response lymphocytes resident macrophages monocytes and neutrophils perform their inflammatory functions causing increased endothelial and alveolar epithelial cell damage and microvascular thrombosis as reflected in elevations of lactic dehydrogenase and dimer d 25 this endothelial damage could be progressive and potentially involve the microvascular beds of the kidney brain and other organs 1an attractive alternative to deal with the covid-19 pandemic which may even be able to handle the emergence of new strains due to acquired mutations of sars-cov-2 is to search for agents that could block the activity of the at1rs 26 while simultaneously reducing the vascular injury mediated by ang ii characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress since nuclear factor-kappa b nf-kb is stimulated after the coupling of rat1 and ang ii it would be beneficial to activate the expression of various cytokines such as tnf- il-6 il-8 mcp-1 and vcam-1 by generating oxidative stress altering endothelial nitric oxide and inducing the activity of nadph oxidase that increases the production of superoxide and peroxynitrite 27 28 29 30therefore increasing ace2 expression through at1r blockade 26 may affect viral replication and the release of useful viral materials this would confer protection against the ali generated by sars-cov-2 due to the counterbalance of the excess production of ang ii and its potentially harmful effects 18 26 however a limitation in the use of available at1r blockers is the risk or potential of deleterious hemodynamic effects of arterial hypotension 26 although there is currently a lack of detailed information on hypotension rates among hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 during this pandemic 26 yu and colleagues 31 reported that half of the patients with sars-cov infection developed hypotension during their hospitalizationin this regard ptx as the drug we are considering repositioning for covid-19 treatment has shown atr blocking effects in experimental studies along with clinical evidence in humans showing no secondary effect on blood pressure 32 33 34all available reports and anecdotal information indicate that the pathological process contributing to severe cases of covid-19 is largely related to dysregulation of the immune system owing to a storm of cytokine production characterized by increased expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with a concomitant decrease in naive cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and regulatory t cells tregs 35 36 these findings may be related to previous descriptions of an association of higher levels of serum inflammatory cytokines with extensive lung damage in patients with other coronavirus infections in addition to sars-cov-2 including sars-cov and mers-cov 36 this is due to induction of the production of large amounts of chemokines and cytokines il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 by cov-infected cells followed by the recruitment of lymphocytes 36coronaviruses also infects macrophages which present the antigens of the virus to the t cells thereby generating their activation and differentiation into the different subtypes of t lymphocytes this results in the massive release of cytokines to amplify the immune response 39 the continuous production of these mediators due to viral persistence ultimately harms cd8 t cells and natural killer cells 36 37the cd8 t cells in sars-cov infection play a vital role in the elimination of infected cells and in generating inflammatory immune damage accounting for 80 of the total inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium in patients infected with sars-cov 36 37 in experimental models t-cell-deficient balbc mice transduced with ad5-hdp4 were compared with controls and b-cell-deficient mice demonstrating that t cells could survive in the infected lungs and destroy infected cells 37 using these same models the depletion of cd8 t cells did not affect viral replication during sars-cov infection 38 39 whereas the depletion of cd4 t cells was associated with reduced numbers of lung lymphocytes decreased production of neutralizing antibodies and cytokines and strong immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis with delayed clearance of sars-cov from the lungs 40 moreover t-helper cells th produce inflammatory cytokines through the nf-b signalling pathway 41 and il-17 cytokines recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection with inflammation to activate other downstream signalling pathways for cytokines and chemokines such as il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 9 42a study of 452 patients with covid-19 in wuhan china demonstrated an increase in the neutrophillymphocyte ratio with a high frequency of lymphopenia of t cells and cd4 t cells 35 this study further showed that patients with severe cases of covid-19 had higher serum levels of inflammatory cytokines tnf- il-1 and il-6 compared to those of individuals of the same age suffering from a milder form of the disease 35similar to other viral infections direct virus-induced cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses may play an essential role in the disease severity of covid-19 since subsets of naive cd4 t cells were found to be elevated with a smaller percentage of memory cells and tregs 36 43 in particular cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells play an essential role in attenuating innate immune responses during viral infection 36 by contrast tregs attenuate the activation proliferation and effector functions of a wide range of immune cells for the maintenance of auto-tolerance and immune homeostasis 37 38 39moreover a histopathological study of biopsy specimens from patients that died of covid-19 in china revealed that the lungs were full of a gelatinous substance 39 that was suspected to contain hyaluronic acid ha given its reported dysfunction and deregulation in the case of sars-cov infection 40 the levels of inflammatory cytokines eg il-1 and tnf- are elevated in patients with covid-19 and these cytokines are important inducers of ha-synthase 2 has2 in cd31 endothelial cells epcam alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts 41the chinese national health commission reported that patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed high leukocyte numbers and plasma levels of the inflammatory markers crp globular sedimentation rate and d-dimer 42 another research group 9 found a correlation between viral rna in the blood with the incidence of ground-glass opacities and acute cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 they further reported high blood levels of cytokines and chemokines including il 1- il-1ra il-7 il- 8 il-9 il-10 basic fgf2 gcsf gmcsf ifn- ip10mcp1 mip1 mip1 pdgfb tnf- and vegf similarly patients admitted to the intensive care unit showed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines including il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip1 and tnf-in another study 44 the viral load of sars-cov-2 in serum rnaemia was positive only in critically ill patients with more severe lymphopenia and a higher number of neutrophils and the degree of rnaemia was positively correlated with both il-6 levels and the mortality rate notably the authors acknowledged that they did not measure other cytokines due to the lack of available reagents however this association of rnaemia with disease severity suggests a correlation with other inflammatory markers 44 this possibility is particularly relevant given our suggestion of not limiting immunomodulatory strategies in the treatment of covid-19 to the current trend of focusing on the il-6r jak-stat3 pathway whose cost-benefit analysis would also be questionablexu et al 39 documented the characteristics of a patient in china who died of severe sars-cov-2 infection indicating substantial reduction in cd4 and cd8 t-cell counts they also found that these cells were overactive showing high proportions of hladr cd4 347 and cd38 cd8 394 double-positive fractions and a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cd4ccr6 th17 cells 39 furthermore this patient had high concentrations of cytotoxic granules which is another marker of hyperactive cd8 t cells 316 of which were perforin-positive 642 were granulysin-positive and 305 were both perforin- and granulysin-positive this dysregulation of the immune system clinically manifests as respiratory failure with extensive lung damage which is histopathologically related to the massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages diffuse alveolar damage with the formation of hyaline membranes and diffuse thickening of the alveolar wall 39 42 in addition to the pathological findings of patients who died from sars-cov-2 infection splenic atrophy and necrosis of the lymph nodes have been observed further suggesting the progression to shock and multiple organ failure due to tissue damage to the heart liver and kidneys 35 39dysregulation of the immune response in covid-19 involves an immunosuppression stage with a subsequent inflammatory state characterized by a substantial reduction in peripheral lymphocyte counts that is correlated with disease severity 45 as cd4 and cd8 t cells are the most affected subpopulations in this process the immune response to the virus is consequently compromised thereby increasing the risk of bacterial superinfection 46 47 although the detailed mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of lymphopenia is not fully understood one of the pathways involved in lymphopenia induced by respiratory viral infections is cell death triggered by activation of the fasfas-ligand interaction as well as induction of the apoptosis axis from tnf- ligands 47 48 49overall these compounding effects of sars-cov-2 infection on the immune response and inflammation lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to search for appropriate immunomodulatory strategies to dampen inflammatory responses without simultaneously suppressing the immune response to avoid any deleterious effects in this regard in 2003 bermejo et al 50 suggested the use of ptx for the treatment of sars-cov infection due to its anti-inflammatory effect by reducing tnf- and ifn- this proposal was further based on the ability of ptx to regulate activation of the transcription factors nf-b and nfat and to inhibit various viruses such as herpes simplex virus human immunodeficiency virus tick-borne encephalitis virus and rotavirus in cell cultures with this background in 2006 barnard et al 51 tested the effects of ptx on the replication of sars-cov in vitro and in a mouse model of experimental infection although they found no effective inhibition of sars-cov replication in vitro ptx showed a weak effect in inhibiting the replication of the virus in the lungs of mice albeit without statistical significanceptx is a drug with multifactorial action including pde inhibition 52 and increasing camp levels which in turn activate pka 53 leading to a reduction in the synthesis of the inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and tnf- 52 53 54 these inhibitory effects on pdes result in an overall reduction of inflammation 54 55 similarly ptx modulates ifn- 56 57 58 and other molecules such as intracellular adhesion molecule type 1 icam-1 vascular cellular adhesion molecule type 1 vcam-1 and crp 59 60based on these foundations several models of kidney disease and clinical studies have shown that ptx is capable of attenuating proteinuria through modulating inflammatory cytokines 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 in addition clinical trials with diabetic nephropathy patients demonstrated that ptx enhanced the antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin receptor blockade 70 71 the effect of ptx on the ras appears to be primarily related to its inhibition of at1r expression this speculation was supported by studies using a rat model of heart failure induced by coronary artery ligation in which ptx infusion to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus attenuated the increase in at1r expression 32 and ptx treatment could prevent the overexpression of at1r mrna 33 in addition azhar and el-bassossy 72 showed that ptx significantly decreased at1r expression in the aortic tissue in a rat model of metabolic syndrome and counteracted the induced hypertension by reducing the degree of inflammation based on significantly lower levels of tnf- and higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectinfurther ptx shows promise as a useful therapeutic tool for covid-19 because the ras is one of the most critical systems activated during oxidative stress upon binding of ang ii with at1rs the secondary messengers inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol are produced resulting in the production of reactive oxygen and vasoconstriction 73a meta-analysis showed that ptx had an anti-inflammatory effect in adults with a variety of disorders including coronary artery disease type 2 diabetes mellitus idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease the statistically significant differences were corroborated by a reduction in plasma concentrations of tnf- and crp and no deleterious effects on blood pressure 34from a practical perspective to reposition ptx for covid-19 li et al 74 proposed using ptx as a treatment strategy for ards in 2016 based on its ability to specifically interfere with camp signalling 24 considering that an increase in both tregs and th lymphocytes producing interleukin il-17 th17 cells along with an imbalance of the tregth17 ratio are among the main immune alterations observed in ards 75 76 77 78 79 80 targeting camp signalling is a reasonable strategy to induce immune tolerance in particular camp signalling plays a critical role give in the proliferation and function of tregs and effector t cells that is camp suppresses the adaptive differentiation of tregs mediated by tgf-1 to reduce the treg content 81 82 using a mouse model of cephalic ligation and puncture-induced ards li et al 74 demonstrated that ptx pre-treatment attenuated lung injury and reduced the mortality rate the authors further observed an increase in the camp levels of the spleens of the ptx-pretreated mice whereas the number of tregs and th17 cells decreased more interestingly overexpression of stat3 which is required for th17 differentiation restored the tregth17 ratio accompanied by a decrease in il-2 il-6 il-10 and il-17 levels and significant inhibition of the expression of foxp3 and rort 74 considering that these transcription factors are essential regulators of the differentiation and function of tregsth17 cells 82 83 li and colleagues concluded that ptx-induced increases in camp might have partially restored the tregth17 balance by modulating foxp3 and rort transcription through the stat3 pathway therefore regulating the tregth17 balance and the subsequent immune response through camp signalling was proposed as a feasible treatment strategy for ards 74moreover ptx was shown to inhibit tnf- production by alveolar macrophages 84 85 because pulmonary sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease interactions between an antigen-presenting cell and an unknown antigen are perceived by naive cd4 lymphocytes th0 cells and alveolar macrophages leading to the activation and proliferation of both cell types and the consequent release of il-2 tnf- and ifn- 86 in support of these effects adding ptx to a systemic steroid regimen allowed for a steroid dose reduction 87 park et al 88 confirmed this steroid-sparing effect of ptx in a randomized controlled clinical trial in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in which ptx improved the pulmonary diffusion of carbon monoxide and arterial blood oxygen pressure during exercise especially in patients who were naive to steroid treatmentin addition to these anti-inflammatory properties ptx has also been reported to suppress tissue fibrosis by blocking tgf-1 and preventing the deposition of type i collagen 89 90 several in vitro studies have shown that ptx inhibits fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production 91 92 93 and a clinical study demonstrated that administration of ptx to obese patients decreased the plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 94 these findings motivated lee and colleagues 95 to test the effect of ptx administration in an experimental model of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats and found a decrease in the expression levels of both fibronectin and pai-1 this was considered to be particularly relevant in light of evidence that pai-1 expression is elevated in fibrotic pathological conditions indeed pai-1 contributes to a reduction in fibrinolysis rates and a subsequent decrease in the degradation of components of the extracellular matrix including fibronectin leading to tissue fibrosis 96 since there are no clinical guidelines for the management of pulmonary fibrosis ptx is currently recommended for the prevention and treatment of this condition 97 moreover ptx was shown to prevent the development of pneumonitis in patients with breast and lung cancers 98 99taken together the evidence highlighted herein strongly points to the benefits of redirecting ptx as an ethical and legal attempt in the treatment of covid-19 which can help support patients in critical care and overwhelmed hospital resources in the face of this pandemicthe authors certify that they have no

beliefs in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscriptsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and has affected peoples lives globally since first observed in wuhan china in the last days of 2019 12 the main route of virus entry and transmission is respiratory droplets that are expelled and absorbed by the mucous membranes especially the nasal and larynx mucosa covid-19 spreads readily via person-to-person contact 3 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies from an asymptomatic form to severe respiratory failure srf that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit icu and can lead to multi-organ failure pneumonia is the most frequent serious manifestation of covid-19 characterized primarily by fever dry cough and dyspnea other less common symptoms are headaches sore throat and rhinorrhea in addition to respiratory symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms myalgia skin rashes and neurological involvement have also been reported 13 4 5 6sars-cov-2 belongs to the coronavirus family members of which have caused two previous epidemics at the beginning of the 21st century one named sars-cov and the other middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronaviruses are large enveloped viruses with a positive sense rna genome the lipid bilayer envelope of the virus contains several proteins with different tasks the spike or s glycoprotein has two domains of s1 and s2 is responsible for invasion attachment and entry into human cells the receptor-binding domain rbd in s1 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the human host cell surface which is a similar entry mechanism to sars-cov however the s2 domain is responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry with higher affinity 7 higher expression of the ace2 receptor in adults compared to children may be a reason for the higher infection rate seen in adults 89 another noteworthy point is the increased level of enzymes in the liver heart and kidneys in covid-19 patients with pneumonia which is consistent with the tissue expression profile of the ace2 receptor 10 this could also explain the occurrence of multi-organ failure in some patients 11since both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have the same cell entry mechanism the pathogenesis of both viruses could be the same or at least very similar 12 ace2 is the common factor that binds to the superficial s glycoprotein on the envelope of the virus it seems that this binding is sensed essentially by toll-like receptor-7 tlr-7 which is present in endosomes and which then leads to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines 1314 ace2 is highly expressed in some organs like lung epithelial cells especially type ii pneumocytes and in cells of the heart kidneys gastrointestinal tract liver and bladder 1516 therefore these organs constitute the main target for the virus following entry of sars-cov-2 into the cell the viral rna genome is transferred from the envelope into the cytoplasm and the translation process begins after replication of the rna new viral particles are formed by incorporating part of the host cell membrane in the new viral envelope although sars-cov-2 buds from the infected cell it does not lyse it directly 17 infected lung epithelial cells produce interleukin il-8 which acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and t lymphocytes 18 the innate immune response is initially triggered by lung epithelial cells alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the next stage adaptive immune responses are triggered involving t and b lymphocytes to complete the complete immune response 19 virus particles containing single-stranded ssrna act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps and provoke a strong innate immune response after recognition by toll-like receptor 7 tlr7 which is expressed on monocyte-macrophages and dendritic cells dc tlr7 can activate several signaling pathways and transcription factors such as janus kinase transducers jakstat nuclear factor b nf-b activator protein 1 ap-1 interferon response factor 3 irf3 and irf7 this signaling cascade leads to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like il-1 il-6 monocyte chemo attractant protein-1 mcp-1 mip-1a tumor necrosis factor  tnf- and ultimately interferon 1 ifn1 20 furthermore neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection where they kill viruses by an oxidative burst defensin secretion and neutrophil extracellular traps nets 21 along with these events antigen presentation subsequently stimulates the bodys specific adaptive immunity both humoral and cellular immunity which culminates in approximately 714 days after infection following the representation of antigens by apcs to the cd4 and cd8 t-cells pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced via the nf-b signaling pathway activated b cells secrete virus-specific antibodies while antigen-specific t cytotoxic cells kill virus-infected cells 1722 additionally th17 cells neutrophils and granulocytes secrete il-17 which in turn stimulates production of il-1 il-6 il-8 mcp-1 gro-a g-csf gm-csf tnf- and pge2 all these mediators can increase the recruitment of neutrophils monocytes and other immune cells besides it has been reported that il-17 expression is correlated with several inflammatory respiratory diseases 23 all these immune signaling pathways are designed to create an inflammatory environment with the goal of eradicating sars-cov-2the pathology of sars-cov-2 is not yet completely understood most of our knowledge has been based on research into sars-cov and mers which previously caused epidemics of acute respiratory syndromes in this short duration of the present pandemic studies have shown that sars-cov-2 has several defense mechanisms which makes its eradication more difficult the sars-cov-2 envelope includes attached proteins like m membrane s spike e envelope and n nucleocapsid similar to other coronaviruses the n protein of sars-cov-2 inhibits ifn1 by regulating ifn- synthesis and signaling on the other hand the effectiveness of the innate immune response against viral infection depends mainly on ifn1 production and its downstream signaling that results in controlling viral replication and induction of an adequate adaptive immune response 720 however the virus could avoid this attack due to the complex immune dysregulation caused by this infection chronic stimulation of t cells resulting in a cytokine storm and t cell exhaustion weakens the overall body defenses and puts the patient in a dangerous situation high-grade chronic viral infections result in cd8 t cell exhaustion tex leading to a decreased effector function and lower proliferative capacity tex leads to over-expression of inhibitory receptors including cd279 pd-1 a lymphoid cell surface protein of the ig superfamily and a member of the extended cd28ctla-4 family of t cell regulators which act as a mature t cell checkpoint for the modulation of apoptosis pd-1 can bind to either of its ligands pd-l1cd274 and pd-l2cd273 both members of b7 family of t cell co-receptors this binding causes significant suppression of the immune system by affecting t cells as well as b cells and nk cells 7202425 another important observation is the strong correlation between inflammatory markers including esr crp and il-6 and the relevant subset of lymphocytes 26 overall general lymphopenia is seen in covid-19 patients especially in severe cases 2728similar to all infectious diseases the immune system plays an essential role in virus suppression therefore it can be assumed that suppression of the immune defense system will make the situation worse but it is not as simple as it sounds 29 there has not yet been enough scientific evidence to generally employ immunosuppressive drugs in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis ra 3031 on the other hand the hyper-inflammatory and cytokine release syndrome crs typical of covid-19 causes tissue damage to the lung epithelium and ards 32 therefore immunosuppressive drugs may be useful as there is some evidence that an anti-il-6 approach is effective in critically ill patients in the icu 33 another high-risk group for covid-19 is cancer patients who are administered cytotoxic drugs although their immune function may be at an acceptable level some cytotoxic drugs such as 6-mp used in chemotherapy have shown destructive effects on virus replication in vitro 31 on the other hand the high number of critically ill patients and increased mortality in patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension and diabetes has been proven 34 diabetes mellitus type ii can include a hyperinflammatory state with a low-grade inflammatory activity that causes long-term immune system stimulation 35 along with adipose tissue side effects on the immune system which ultimately drives an immune imbalance 36 also due to the overexpression of ace2 in islet cells of the pancreas sars-cov-2 may be a diabetogenic virus that causes severe instability in the blood glucose levels of diabetes patients which worsens the inflammatory imbalance 37 as a consequence the condition of diabetic patients can be worsened after covid-19 infection as evidenced by the higher levels of multiple enzymes and inflammatory cytokines compared to nondiabetic individuals with covid-19 pneumonia 38cd147 also known as basigin or extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer emmprin is also recognized as a red blood cell rbc receptor for the parasite that causes malaria in humans and is a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin family its expression is induced in several conditions such as asthma cancer stem cells high glucose concentration in monocytes and inflammatory processes 39 wang et al recently demonstrated that the sars-cov-2 sp also binds to cd147 40 so the immune system itself could be an entryway for sars-cov-2patients with covid-19 have increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il-1 il-6 il-8 il-17 il-17 ccl-2 tnf- g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 and mip the concentration of these markers fluctuates depending on the individuals condition it seems that increased cytokine levels especially il-6 have a direct association with a worsened patient condition 41 furthermore as higher levels of cytokines rapidly lead to deterioration of the patients condition and death they could be considered to be prognostic markers in the clinic 42 the cytokine storm is typical of macrophage activation syndrome mas or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh consequently tissue damage lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards could be expected 43 furthermore a study showed that the peripheral blood of a patient with severe covid-19 had a strikingly high number of th17 cells which secrete il-17 and are associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in the mucosal immune response il-22 il-17 and tnf- are known to induce antimicrobial peptides also il-22 upregulates mucins fibrinogen and anti-apoptotic proteins therefore il-22 may contribute to the formation of life-threatening edema and the lungs may become enriched with mucins and fibrin leading to the progression of ards seen in covid-19 patients 44 all of the above-mentioned factors result in pneumonia and ards besides hyper-ferritinemia coagulopathy and multi-organ failure in the liver heart and kidneys with elevated d-dimer crp bun and cr that are typical of masshlh 2745 however nk cell reduction suppression of antiviral defense activation of aggressive tissue-damaging immune responses via increased il-6 secretion and secondary cs leads to a general picture of hyper-inflammatory immunodeficiency are all in line with primary hlh this is important in terms of the viral load because of the correlation between the rna viral load and ards severity 2746 although the typical masshlh pathology that occurs in immunocompetent patients may also be seen in covid-19 but the differentiation between these two patterns is difficultalthough covid-19 has numerous manifestations lung injury and severe respiratory failure srf are more common than others the cornerstone of this condition is masshlh or immune dysregulation alveolar macrophages secret il-6 that cause overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and dysregulation of lymphocytes characterized by cd4 lymphopenia and subsequently b cell lymphopenia in parallel the absolute natural killer nk cell count is depleted probably as a result of the rapidly multiplying virus moreover il-6 decreases the expression of hla-dr on the membrane and production of ifn- by cd4 cells 4 in conclusion it seems that innate immunity characterized by neutrophils and proinflammatory cytokines in the format of the cytokine storm is trying to limit the infection and overcome the virus however it leads to an excessive inflammatory response rather than harming the virus this causes lung injury with tissue damage and life-threatening edema enriched with mucins and fibrin that unfortunately causes srf and death in severely affected patients 22it seems that lymphopenia hyper-inflammatory state and cytokines all play a role in the pathology of covid-19 hence the hypothesis was proposed that immunomodulatory drugs may be beneficial to reverse the condition and treat the disease 47 considering the pivotal role of il-6 in cs tocilizumab as an il-6 inhibitor could be effective in covid-19 patients with a severe condition 33 there are limited data about the effects of other immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids il-1 inhibitors mycophenolate mofetil anti-tnf-a agents methotrexate and nsaids in covis-19 and further in vitro and in vivo studies are recommended 31 due to the t cell lymphopenia and reduced function immunoglobulins produced by b cells represent the main arm of the immune system to combat the virus seroconversion and antibody production occurs by the first two weeks after infection 48 like other infections specific igm is the first defense to appear and disappears after a short time but specific igg remains a long-term defense against the virus therefore neutralizing iggs play a major role in the patient recovery and control of infection iggs reach their peak in the serum during the convalescent phase and tend to wane after recovery but memory b cells could still survive to offer long-term protection 2249there is a global effort to find an effective treatment for covid-19 although the benefits of some available drugs have been proven they are not yet a certain specific cure for the disease and controversies remain 50 according to previous experience with other coronavirus family members convalescent plasma therapy has been tested on some critically ill patients with promising results in this regard several studies have confirmed the positive effects of this treatment especially in critically ill patients in the icu and with ards to shorten hospitalization time and reduce the mortality rate the covid-19 specific igg antibodies act as passive immune therapy and after administration by the transfused plasma might neutralize viral particles and activate the complement system which could consequently lead to viral elimination despite its efficacy this method has some difficulties such as concerns about causing an infection and non-infectious transfusion reactions transfusion-induced infection is rare in industrial countries unlike poor countries while the latter is a global worry known as transfusion-related acute lung injury trali and allergic reactions as an important point igg collected in one country may be different from another country because lifestyle diet genetics and the environment could play an important role in the development of specific antibodies against the virus furthermore differences between strains of coronavirus should be considered in geographically distinct areas so treatment of infected cases with polyclonal igg collected from the same area may increase the chance of an effective response 50 51 52 53 54 55 as a result specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize the virus particles to inhibit multiplication and cell entry may be more practical and reliable wang et al reported some positive findings about creation of a monoclonal antibody against the s protein of the virus that could inhibit cell attachment and entry 56the worldwide economy culture transport sport interpersonal relationships education and each individuals lifestyle have been influenced by the covid-19 pandemic 57 however the lethality of this virus is much lower than found in previous pandemics what makes covid-19 so significant and dangerous is the rapid acceleration of the virus transmission despite all efforts to control and treat this disease public quarantine and lockdown measures cannot be implemented forever and all tested treatment methods have not been sufficiently effective therefore along with trying to find more effective specific drugs the effort to find a vaccine should be redoubled in order to gain herd immunity and allow the world to return to normal life and resume its routine because the process of vaccine preparation and testing is complicated and lengthy validating and marketing vaccines can be tedious but given the body of work by various research groups there is a clear prospect of achieving this goal sooner rather than later 205859the covid-19 pandemic is an ongoing issue that affects the lives of most people around the world most countries are now semi-closed strict travel regulations have been enacted international relations have been affected and humans are experiencing an unprecedented regime which has changed ordinary life 60 therefore it is of the utmost importance to understand the pathophysiology of disease and how the immune response to the pathogen affects the disease although the immune system plays an important role in fighting covid-19 paradoxically it could also be harmful most critically ill patients in icu that develop ards have high levels of inflammatory cytokines in their circulation known as crs considering all the reported data from observations and measurements it seems that when the immune system is severely damaged and becomes inefficient by lymphopenia and tex it tries to compensate by triggering the crs which could potentially lead to complications like ards and multi-organ failure it is necessary to find efficient drugs and vaccines to return to the normal situation and reduce the mortality rateboth authors had role in concept and design of the paper fy drafted the manuscript while nr critically revised it both authors approved the final draft of manuscriptthe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interestin december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia cases was reported in wuhan china the outbreak was linked to the huanan food market the new virus 2019-ncov so called then was isolated on 7 january 2020 and identified as the cause of the outbreak 1 the 2019-ncov virus rapidly spread across china and many other countries and caused a rapidly growing global outbreak on 11 february 2020 the who has named the disease covid-19 short for coronavirus disease 2019 2 and on 12 march 2020 the total number of covid-19 confirmed cases reached 125260 globally with 80981 cases in china and 44279 outside of china and the covid-19 was declared to be a pandemic by the who 3 as of 26 may 2020 covid-19 has been confirmed in 5404512 individuals globally with deaths reaching 343514 with a morality of 64 the united states had the highest number of confirmed cases 1618757 cases 4covid-19 is caused by the sars-cov-2 that belongs to the beta-coronaviruses subfamily coronaviruses are enveloped positive single stranded large rna viruses although the first data available about covid-19 indicates possible animal-to-human transmission via wild animals in huanan seafood market in wuhan 5 6 epidemiological data and studies after that have increasingly demonstrated that the virus transmits human-to-human through droplets or direct contact with the reporting that individuals who did not have direct contact with the huanan seafood market were diagnosed with covid-19 and with secondary cases occurring at hospitals among health care workers who had extensive contact with covid-19 patients the virus was confirmed to spread through respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes 79 with the ability of the host to shed the infection while asymptomatic 10 studies are now also proposing the possible feco-oral transmission of the virus 11covid-19 patients are mainly adults older than 18 years old with a male predominance the preconceived notion that pediatrics are not subjected to infection later changed with confirmed cases occurring in pediatrics in china and worldwide 12 13 however mortality is still much more in the adult group above the age of 65 years adults with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases respiratory diseases endocrine diseases diabetics or immunocompromised adults remain the most exposed to serious complication of covid-19 14although many patients of covid-19 remain asymptomatic some patients get pneumonia and 10 of cases require mechanical ventilation and icu admission patients usually present with fever dry cough shortness of breath headache malaise muscle and bony aches less common symptoms include sore throat confusion productive cough hemoptysis diarrhea nausea and chest pain 15 progression to pneumonia is documented by radiological findings and usually occurs 12 weeks after the beginning of the symptoms signs of pneumonia include decreased oxygen saturation deterioration of blood gas multi-focal glass ground opacities or patchysegmental consolidation in chest x-ray or ct patients presenting late or deteriorating hospitalized patients usually suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute respiratory failure acute renal injury and multi-organ failure 1517complete blood picture of covid-19 patients usually shows lymphopenia with or without total leukopenia a lymphocyte count 10  109l has been associated with severe disease 18 a recent research has reported that severe cases of covid-19 tend to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr nlr is calculated from a routine blood picture by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count and indicates a patients overall inflammatory status increasing nlr is a risk factor of mortality not only in infectious diseases but also in malignancy acute coronary syndrome intracerebral hemorrhage polymyositis and dermatomyostis 19 platelet count is usually normal or mildly decreased c-reaction protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are usually increased while procalcitonin levels are normal and elevation of procalcitonin usually indicates secondary bacterial infection lactate dehydrogenase ferritin d-dimer and creatine kinase elevation is associated with severe disease elevation in creatinine or liver enzyme levels alt and ast occurs in complicated cases progressing to multi-organ failure 18the newly emerging covid-19 is continuing to challenge medical health systems all over the world and the scenario is still getting worse the covid-19 poses an increasing threat to humans with a fatality rate of 64  so far 4 covid-19 infection is accompanied by an aggressive inflammatory response with the release of a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in an event known as cytokine storm the host immune response to the sars-cov-2 virus is hyperactive resulting in an excessive inflammatory reaction several studies analyzing cytokine profiles from covid-19 patients suggested that the cytokine storm correlated directly with lung injury multi-organ failure and unfavorable prognosis of severe covid-19 16 2024the immune system has an exquisite mechanism capable of responding to various pathogens normal anti-viral immune response requires the activation of the inflammatory pathways of the immune system however aberrant or exaggerated response of the hosts immune system can cause severe disease if remains uncontrolled 25 cytokines are an essential part of the inflammatory process cytokines are produced by several immune cells including the innate macrophages dendritic cells natural killer cells and the adaptive t and b lymphocytes during an innate immune response to a viral infection pattern recognition receptors prrs recognize different molecular structures that are characteristic to the invading virus these molecular structures are referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps binding of pamps to prrs triggers the start of the inflammatory response against the invading virus resulting in the activation of several signaling pathways and subsequently transcription factors which induce the expression of genes responsible for production of several products involved in the hosts immune response to the virus among which are the genes encoding several pro-inflammatory cytokines the major transcription factors that are activated by prrs are nuclear factor kb activation protein 1 interferon response factors three and seven these transcription factors induce the expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines chemokines and adhesion molecules this sequence of events results in recruitment of leukocytes and plasma proteins to site of infection where they perform various effector functions that serve to combat the triggering infection 26three of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines of the innate immune response are il-1 tnf-  and il-6 tissue macrophages mast cells endothelial and epithelial cells are the major source of these cytokines during innate immune response the cytokine storm results from a sudden acute increase in circulating levels of different pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-1 tnf-  and interferon this increase in cytokines results in influx of various immune cells such as macrophages neutrophils and t cells from the circulation into the site of infection with destructive effects on human tissue resulting from destabilization of endothelial cell to cell interactions damage of vascular barrier capillary damage diffuse alveolar damage multiorgan failure and ultimately death lung injury is one consequence of the cytokine storm that can progress into acute lung injury or its more severe form ards 27 ards leading to low oxygen saturation levels is a major cause of mortality in covid-19 although the exact mechanism of ards in covid-19 patients is not fully understood the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered to be one of the major contributing factors 1517accumulating evidence suggests that some patients with severe covid-19 suffer from a cytokine storm analysis of cytokine levels in plasma of 41 covid-19 confirmed cases in china revealed elevated levels of il-1 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fgf g-csf gm-csf ifn- ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a mip1-b pdgf tnf- and vegf in both patients admitted to the icu and non-icu patients compared to healthy adults all patients included in the study had pneumonia and 13 of the patients were admitted to icu and six of these patients died 16a multicenter retrospective study of 150 covid-19 patients in china evaluated predictors of mortality for covid-19 the study analyzed data from 82 cases who resolved from covid-19 and 68 cases who died from covid-19 and reported significantly higher levels of il-6 in mortality cases than resolving cases 20 another study analyzing data from 21 patients in china reported increased levels of il-10 il-6 and tnf- in severe cases n  11 patients compared to moderate cases n  10 patients 21 a similar study by gao et al assessed 43 patients in china and reported that levels of il-6 were significantly higher in severe cases n  15 than in mild cases n  28 22 similarly chen et al studied a total of 29 covid-19 patients divided into three groups according to relevant diagnostic criteria and found that il-6 was higher in critical cases n  5 patients than in severe cases n  9 patients and that il-6 was higher in severe cases than in mild cases n  15 cases 23no much data is available yet regarding severe pediatric covid-19 patients a study that evaluated eight critically ill chinese pediatric covid-19 patients treated in the icu with ages ranging from 2 months to 15 years reported increased levels of il-6 il-10 and ifn- among other laboratory findings 24cytokine storm cs is a critical life-threating condition requiring intensive care admission and having a quite high mortality cs is characterized by a clinical presentation of overwhelming systemic inflammation hyperferritinemia hemodynamic instability and multi-organ failure and if left untreated it leads to death the trigger for cs is an uncontrolled immune response resulting in continuous activation and expansion of immune cells lymphocytes and macrophages which produce immense amounts of cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm the cs clinical findings are attributed to the action of the proinflammatory cytokines like il-1 il-6 il-18 ifn- and tnf- 27cs has been reported in several viral infections including influenza h5n1 virus 28 29 influenza h1n1 virus 30 and the two coronaviruses highly related to covid-19 sars-cov and mers-cov 31 32 both pro-inflammatory cytokines eg il-1 il-6 and tnf- and anti-inflammatory cytokines eg il-10 and il-1 receptor antagonist are elevated in the serum of cs patients the main contributors to the interplay of the cytokine storm are il-6 and tnf- in the absence of an immediate and appropriate therapeutic intervention patients develop ards as a result of acute lung damage followed by multi-organ failure and resulting in death hence the cs should be treated immediately otherwise mortality can result 28 in addition to anti-viral therapies that can directly target the virus anti-inflammatory therapies that diminish the cytokine responses are suggested to decrease both the morbidity and mortality in covid-19 patientsthe early recognition of cs and the prompt treatment can lead to better outcome several biological agents targeting cytokines have been proposed for treating cs il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra which is used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was proven to be helpful in cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a disease associated with severe cs 33 tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized il-6 receptor antagonist that interferes with il-6 binding to its receptor and blocks signaling tocilizumab is used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis juvenile idiopathic arthritis giant cell arteritis and has proven valuable in treatment of cs triggered by car-t cell therapy for hematological malignancies 34 downstream inhibitors of cytokines eg jak inhibitors are also being explored in treating csas il-6 is the most frequently reported cytokine to be increased in covid-19 patients and as il-6 elevated levels have been associated to higher mortalities tocilizumab is a candidate drug to be used in managing the cytokine storm accompanying covid-19 encouraging results have been reported in china where tocilizumab was used in treatment of 21 patients with severe and critical covid-19 clinical data showed that the symptoms hypoxygenmia and ct opacity changes were improved immediately after the treatment with tocilizumab in most of the patients suggesting that tocilizumab could be an efficient therapeutic agent for treatment of the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 35 the us food and drug administration fda has approved roches phase iii clinical trial of the use of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia the trial is planned to include 330 patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia 36cytokine storm appears to be one of the common causes of mortality in the recently declared pandemic of covid-19 therapeutic approaches to manage the covid-19 cytokine storm might provide an avenue to decrease the covid-19 associated morbidity and mortality and is the focus of upcoming studiesall authors contributed to gathering of data writing editing and revising of the manuscriptthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestcovid-19 is a viral disease originated by a single-stranded rna virus of the coronaviridae family and is characterized by being highly contagious having a non-negligible morbidity rate and being a drain on health resources which is causing a blockage of almost the entire world health system most of the patients developed pneumonia with a serious inflammatory component the so-called cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm syndrome css which in some cases can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and death from respiratory failure according to chinese experience 81 of the clinical cases were mild in nature with an overall fatality rate of 23 while a small subgroup of 5 suffered respiratory failure septic shock and multiple organ failure leading to death in half of these cases suggesting that it is within this group that the opportunity to save lives exists if appropriate measures are taken 1 clinical observations suggest that when the immune response is unable to effectively control the virus as in older people with a weakened immune system the virus spreads more efficiently causing lung tissue damage which activates macrophages and granulocytes and leads to the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible of associated ards 2there appear to be two distinct but overlapping pathological subsets the first triggered by the virus itself and the second by the host response in the first stage patients will benefit from drug therapy directed against the virus and use of anti-inflammatory therapy might not be necessary and might even lead to viral replication although its usefulness in advanced stages might be questionable in the second stage of established lung disease viral multiplication and localized inflammation in the lung is the norm during this stage patients develop viral pneumonia with a cough fever and possibly hypoxia producing chest radiograph images or computed tomography with bilateral infiltrates or ground glass opacities blood tests reveal an increase in lymphopenia along with transaminitis markers of systemic inflammation might be somewhat elevated it is at this stage that the majority of covid-19 patients would need to be hospitalized for close observation and treatment if hypoxia occurs patients are likely to progress to requiring mechanical ventilation and in that situation the use of anti-inflammatory therapies such as corticosteroids might be helpful and might be used judiciously a minority of patients with covid-19 will progress to the third and most severe stage of the disease which manifests as a syndrome of extra-pulmonary systemic hyper-inflammation a css occurs involving a considerable release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin il -2 il-6 il-7 il-12 the stimulatory factor of granulocyte colonies macrophage inflammatory protein 1- tnf- ferritin and d-dimer are significantly elevated in those patients with a more severe disease 3 to date there has been no a standardized treatment for such a hyper-inflammatory state the only treatment options are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus such as inflammation and pulmonary ards suppression of the pro-inflammatory members of the il-1 and il-6 family has been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases including viral infections 3 4 corticosteroids are used because of their known ability to modulate a variety of involved cytokines and apparently being effective in reducing immune-pathological damage other treatments that have shown to be effective are the use of cytokine inhibitors such as the monoclonal anti-human interleukin il-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab il-6 inhibitor or anakinra il-1 receptor antagonist 4 5 the lack of a highly effective specific treatment together with the possible failure in the supply of commonly used drugs because of the great demand makes it necessary to investigate new anti-inflammatory therapiesld-rt has an anti-inflammatory effect which might be useful in the treatment of respiratory complications of covid-19 the anti-inflammatory efficacy of ld-rt has been proven in clinical studies and there have been several experimental models both in vitro and in vivo the radiobiological mechanisms that support this claim are becoming increasingly known unlike high-dose radiation therapy which induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune and endothelial cells ld-rt 0515 gy acts on cells involved in the inflammatory response producing anti-inflammatory effects these effects include the inhibition of interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells a decrease in the production of endothelial adhesion molecules a decrease in the mediators of inflammation and a lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as promoting the induction of macrophage and polymorphonuclear apoptosis low-dose irradiation also lowers the levels of no inos l and e selectins ros tnf-  or il-beta 1 secretion together with an increase in production and expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as anti-inflammatory cytokine tgf-1 and of apoptosis mediators such as nf-b this anti-inflammatory effect of ld-rt was greatest at 48 h after irradiation and was lost after 72 h 6 7 8 9 10 all of these changes result in a local anti-inflammatory environment that would explain the clinical effects of ld-rt by reducing inflammation and alleviating threatening-life symptoms and could be an option to consider for the symptomatic relief of covid-19 associated pneumonia 11 12 13 this type of treatment is non-invasive and therefore a priori and can be used for all types of patients with this objective we designed a pragmatic clinical protocol to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose lung irradiation as an adjunctive treatment in interstitial pneumonia in patients with covid-19bilateral low-dose lung irradiation with a low dose of 05 gy in a single fraction or 1 gy in 2 separate fractions 4872 h after the first depending on the response might interfere with the inflammatory cascade and reduce the severity of cytokine release improve patient oxygenation and decrease the risk of fatal evolution and death in patients with symptomatic covid-19 pneumoniaadult patients with covid-19 with at least moderate to severe pneumonia that warranted hospitalization will be considered for this protocol we propose to include those patients with moderate to severe dyspnoea respiratory frequency  30min oxygen saturation with supplemental o2 supply spo2  92 pao2fio2 ratio or pafio2 ratio the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen partial pressure of oxygen pao2 and the percentage of oxygen supplied fraction of inspired oxygen fio2  300 mmhg where cases are impossible to determine pafio2 sao2fio2 or safio2 percentage of oxyhaemoglobin saturation in capillary arterial blood  315 mmhg will be used instead we will also consider presence of lung infiltrates  50 within 24 to 48 h or patients with laboratory abnormalities such as c-reactive protein crp  100 mgl d-dimer  1500 ngml il-6  40 iu or suspected cytokine release syndrome all consistent with a more severe diseasethis prospective multicentre study was conceived in 2 phases an exploratory phase which will include 10 patients in order to assess the feasibility and efficacy of bilateral lung ld-rt bearing in mind that if there is no improvement in pafio2 safi02 in at least 30 of patients the study will not be continued and a second comparative phase in two groups a control group which will only receive pharmacological treatment and an experimental one receiving pulmonary ld-rt this second phase will include 96 patients the allocation will be 1 2 that is 32 in the control arm and 64 in the experimental arm this number has been calculated by accepting an alpha risk of 005 and a beta risk of a 02 in a two-sided test to find as statistically significant a proportional difference expected to be of 02 in the control group and 05 in the experimental group with a drop-out rate of 10the primary end-point will be to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose pulmonary irradiation as an adjunctive treatment in interstitial pneumonia in patients with covid-19 by improving the pafio2 by 20 measured 4872 h after treatment with respect to baseline pre-irradiation measurement the secondary objectives include assessing the safety of bilateral pulmonary ld-rt evaluating the improvement of the radiological image overall mortality rates at 15 and 30 days after irradiation and characterizing anti-inflammatory mechanisms of ld-rt by measuring level of expression of adhesion molecules anti-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress mediatorsall patients with moderate to severe covid-19 pneumonia will be evaluated by a multidisciplinary board including different specialties such as internal medicine pneumology infectious diseases geriatrics intensive care and radiation oncology to determine the benefit of their inclusion in the studyinclusion criteria table 1 are patients over 18 years old with moderate to severe covid-19 pneumonia as previously described with 8 days of symptom onset and

the preparation and administration of the irradiation all necessary measures will be followed to guarantee the safety of patients and staff regarding the risk of sars-cov-2 transmission following the regulations and instructions of each centre on the day of treatment two technicians with the appropriate personal protective equipment ppe will place the patient according to the protocol of the radiation oncology department in order to carry out the planned radiotherapy ct the radiation oncologist will verify the correct positioning using a planar or tomographic image and the treatment will be carried out from the ct console subsequently the lungs will be delimited a radiation oncologist will define the ptv and the dosimetry plan will be carried out meanwhile two radiotherapists wearing ppe will place the patient in the linear accelerator linac coach at the end of the treatment patients will be removed from the unit by radiotherapists again equipped with the appropriate ppe and will be returned to their room the treatment will be carried out on the same linac to a time schedule in order to avoid the risk of contagion to other patients after the completion of the treatment the treatment room and linac will be decontaminated according to the established protocolthrough descriptive statistics the normality of the distributions will be determined and the test will be chosen for comparisons between groups the prospective nature of these comparisons will be taken into account for the probability of mortality and toxicity calculations the kaplan-meier method will be used in

data protection rgpd the results of this study will be published regardless of whether they are positive negative or inconclusive the study has been approved by the institution research board of each centre and is registered in clinicaltrialsgov nct-04380818phase i of the study is currently ongoing and patients are being recruitedradiotherapy has been used for more than a century in the treatment of pneumonia especially interstitial and atypical in a review by calabrese et al ld-rt to the lungs has demonstrated good response rates and resolution of symptoms the authors reviewed 15 studies covering 863 cases of bacterial pneumonia lobular and bronchopneumonia interstitial and atypical pneumonia that were effectively treated with low-dose x-rays improving symptoms increasing cure rates and reducing mortality the mechanism by which x-ray treatment acts on pneumonia involves the induction of an anti-inflammatory phenotype that leads to a rapid reversal of clinical symptoms facilitating resolution of the disease treatment was most effective when irradiation was administered 6 to 14 days after the clinical onset of the disease after 14 days the successful response rate decreased by approximately 50 the authors conclusion is that ld-rt offers excellent potential as a treatment for interstitial pneumonia especially when used during the early stages of the disease 14 the group of calabrese et al reviewed the results published for 37000 patients treated in the first half of the 20th century with ld-rt between 03 and 15 gy total for different benign diseases characterized by inducing inflammatory states including both degenerative and infectious disorders the authors justify that the success of ld-rt is directly related to the hyper-inflammatory state and to the anti-inflammatory effect of radiation at low doses the authors conclude that a total dose in the range of 031 gy probably induces the expression of an anti-inflammatory phenotype that can reduce inflammation and pain and promote tissue recovery in most subjects although it should not be surprising that a percentage of patients did not respond equally well 15recently in a 2020 publication dhawan et al propose a total dose of 0305 gy in the thoracic region for patients with covid-19 in the acute phase of the disease when cytokines increase and for those who present a moderate or severe clinical situation cytokine storm according to those authors the theoretical basis that would justify the use of ld-rt in patients with covid-19 rests on the fact that inflammation mediators triggered by covid-19 initiate the cascade that leads to a hyper-inflammatory state the so-called cytokine storm ultimately responsible for the rapid and extensive damage to the lungs and other organs the well-known anti-inflammatory phenotype induced by ld-rt is expected to decrease the intensity and severity of covid-19 pneumonia 12as with any other clinical protocol both strengths and weaknesses can be found when considering the use of ld-rt for covid-19 pneumonia we are fully aware that the use of ld-rt does not replace any of the treatments currently in use and that it should not be recommended for all covid-19 patients but it could be considered for those patients in a more critical condition and when other treatment options have failed are not indicated or it is not possible to access them quickly and easily an additional advantage of this treatment would be that unlike vaccines and pharmacological treatments that depend on the stock radiotherapy devices are always available for the treatment of patients without being subject to fluctuations according to higher demand but on the other side one of the aspects that has sometimes prevented researchers from using ld-rt for the treatment of benign diseases has been the risk of late complications especially the development of secondary cancers studies into the safety of ld-rt for the treatment of benign non-tumour pathology have all concluded that the risk of presenting complications attributable to irradiation is extremely low at the doses suggested in the present study 16 17 18 19in conclusion there is a broad metabolic and immunological basis that would justify the use of ld-rt in covid-19 patients mainly in the most advanced stages of the disease when it could be effective by acting as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent against the cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and together with its low acute and late toxicity profile it is an option that could be considered for patients with covid-19 pneumoniathe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papersevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 is a recently discovered coronavirus capable of causing the 2019 to 2020 respiratory infection known as covid-19 symptoms range from fever and coughing to pneumonia or severe respiratory distress eg shortness of breath it is related to the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars from 2002 to 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers first reported in 2012 worldwide over 8400 people became sick with sars of whom over 800 died for mers close to 2500 cases have been detected with about 850 related deaths data from world health organization and national institutes of health websites covid-19 is widespread and in the midst of this global pandemic as of late april 2020 there were about three million confirmed infections and over 200000 deaths reported worldwide for updates see the johns hopkins university coronavirus covid-19 dashboard httpswwwarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlbda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 to date there have been no agents proven to be capable of countering the virus and vaccine candidates are in early clinical testing with availability to the general public at least a year awayfrom an immunological standpoint coronaviruses cause increases in the levels of t-helper 1 th1 cytokine interferon ifn gamma of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 and il-12 and of related cytokines and chemokines including il-8 chemokine c-c motif ligand 2 ccl2 protein also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or mcp-1 and c-x-c motif chemokine 10 cxcl10 protein also known as interferon gamma-induced protein 10 or ip-10 17 the cytokine storm mediated by these inflammatory and th1 cytokines activates monocytesmacrophages and neutrophils and is responsible for the immunopathological consequences of the infection it is recognized that hyperinflammatory immune responses can result in increased disease severity and mortality therefore inhibition of the hyperinflammatory response is a definitive drug therapy objective it has been proposed that certain biological response modifiers notably cytokines il-37 and il-38 have the potential to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines such as il-6 andor to induce an anti-inflammatory immune response or an immunomodulatory response that could counteract covid-19 patients hyperinflammatory responses 810 however the time it might take to develop such cytokine products for the treatment of covid-19 patients is unknown at this time there is an urgent need for substances that can potentially counter the effects of sars-cov-2 and alleviate the symptoms and severity of covid-19 in the current situation every avenue of health care that might be available to decrease morbidity and disease symptoms and severity and promote survival may be worthy of investigation accordingly it is suggested that clinical trials could be conducted on certain substances with immunomodulatory activity from the realm of complementary and alternative medicine these immunomodulatory agents while unconventional in nature offer potential treatment advantages and could augment or possibly be used in place of standard clinical treatments furthermore these potential immunomodulatory agents may be readily available for utilization in clinical trials sanctioned by the us food and drug administration fda or other government drug regulatory agencies this report discusses four such agents which were selected based on our prior research conducted both independently and collaboratively they are i low-dose oral interferon alpha ifn-alpha ii microdose dna iii low-dose thimerosal and iv oral or inhalable by inhaler not by combustion phytocannabinoidsifn-alpha is a cytokine that is a known inducer of antiviral immune responses there have been commercially available injectable versions of ifn-alpha eg ifn-alpha-2b roferon approved by the fda for use only in cases of chronic hepatitis c and certain forms of cancer ifn-alpha-2b is dosed at 3 to 9 million international units iu and has substantial side effects see httpswwwdrugscomproroferon-ahtml one other noteworthy use of ifn-alpha has been in the treatment of behcets disease an inflammatory blood vessel disease with a cytokine profile that has been characterized as th1-like in nature 11 in contrast to formulations such as ifn-alpha-2b oral oromucosal administration of human or bovine ifn-alpha at low doses of 50 to 200 units has been investigated as a potential antiviral strategy for several decades there have been substantial in vitro in vivo and human and veterinary clinical research studies involving the use of low-dose oral ifn-alpha against infections caused by herpes and influenza viruses foot and mouth disease virus and a variety of bovine respiratory viruses 1214 from a mechanistic standpoint low concentrations of ifn-alpha can regulate the expression of a variety of cytokine genes chemokine genes and related genes involved in antiviral immune responses in one such study involving peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from calves treated with 50 or 200 units of oral ifn-alpha the expression levels of 41 of 92 tested autoimmune and inflammatory response-associated genes were significantly upregulated or downregulated 15 using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg online database httpswwwgenomejpkegg 12 of these genes were identified as involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions what was particularly intriguing was that seven of these genes csf1 cxcl12 fas il2ra il6r tnfrsf1a and tnfsf13b were downregulated at the 50-u concentration whereas five of these genes ifnar2 il1a il1b il-10 and il10rb were upregulated at the 200-u concentration increased production of cytokine il-10 encoded by the il-10 gene mediated by ifn-alpha was a key finding in an in vitro study of pbmcs derived from behcets disease patients 16 the investigators related the effectiveness of administration of ifn-alpha in treatment of diseases such as behcets disease to changes in th1 and inflammatory cytokine levels these data suggest that low-dose oral ifn-alpha can regulate the expression of specific immune response genes and the production of specific cytokines or chemokines that may be relevant to the alleviation of covid-19 symptoms while the use of low-dose oral interferon as prophylaxis for influenza in a double-blind fda-authorized clinical trial did not prevent acute respiratory illness in treated relative to control individuals it did reduce symptom severity and was seen as beneficial to a subpopulation of patients 17 currently it is marketed as a nutraceutical under the trade name of paximune given the body of existing research and the unmet medical needs of covid-19 patients plus a favorable safety profile at these dose levels it is believed that an fda-authorized clinical trial of this substance specifically for reducing the symptoms and severity of respiratory symptoms in covid-19 patients could be conducted in relatively short ordercystic fibrosis cf is a genetic disease characterized by abnormal viscous mucus secretions the viscosity of these secretions results from the high concentration of exogenous dna that is released from necrotic neutrophils 18 this observation resulted in the development of the dna-degrading enzyme dnase dornase alfa pulmozyme as a treatment for cf symptoms 19 since the presence of excessive neutrophils in the sputum of cf patients suggested an aberrant compensatory immune response it was hypothesized that the use of exogenous sublingually administered dna can be applicable as a neutralization therapy this hypothesis was the basis for the development of a proprietary formulation of a low concentration of dna fragments derived from salmon sperm dna otherwise referred to as microdose dna 20 21 the term microdose was applied based on its oral sublingual administration in microgram-range doses 06 g per dose based on a 12 gml dna concentration and a drop volume of 50 l it was hoped that sublingual dosing with microdose dna would decrease neutrophil necrosis and dna release into the lungs thus decreasing sputum viscosity microdose dna was first utilized in evidence-based clinical testing of cf patients this sublingual therapeutic approach subsequently was extended to patients with other respiratory diseases and otitis media the specific mechanisms of action of microdose dna has not been elucidated at least five different hypotheses have been postulated among these hypotheses are those positing the generation of beneficial immune responses through increases in levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and immunomodulatory changes in t-helper 1t-helper 2 th1th2 cytokine ratios 21 there is some experimental evidence from in vivo studies of dogs with kennel cough indicating that microdose dna treatment increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-4 s w mamber unpublished data it has also been observed that the dna fragments might contain oligodeoxynucleotides odns with the cpg motif cpg odns which are known to stimulate an immune response to viral infections 22 under the clinical trial names hp-3 and ml-03 microdose dna was tested in three separate fda-approved placebo-controlled double-blind phase ii clinical trials one for the treatment of cf one for chronic bronchitis and one for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd there were only 17 treatment patients and 20 patients on placebo in the cf clinical trial although the trials were underpowered to achieve statistical significance a trend toward improvement was observed for three respiratory parameters in the chronic bronchitis trial 25 patients were administered microdose dna with 24 patients on placebo among other endpoints there was a statistically significant improvement p  0007 in forced expiratory volume fef2575 a measure of small-airway function finally in the copd clinical trial there were 23 patients randomized to receive microdose dna versus 25 on placebo there was a statistically significant outcome p  0019 in a key endpoint the 6-min walk test 21 all three clinical trials demonstrated the potential of microdose dna in improving respiratory function in patients with different lung diseases moreover there were no safety issues apparent in these trials though it was not developed further as a pharmaceutical agent for economic reasons the current dna-based therapeutic is being marketed as a nutraceutical and is being sold commercially as mucolyxir the combined evidence-based and clinical trial experiences with various respiratory ailments plus commercial availability make microdose dna a viable candidate to test in clinical trials for treatment of covid-19 respiratory symptomsthimerosal alternatively thiomersal is an organomercury compound that is commonly used as a vaccine preservative with a typical concentration of 001 a 05-ml dose of vaccine contains 50 g of thimerosal because of controversy surrounding the presence of thimerosal in vaccines and neurological diseases such as autism the use of thimerosal in vaccines has been curtailed over the past 20 years see httpswwwfdagovvaccines-blood-biologicssafety-availability-biologicsthimerosal-and-vaccines however some researchers have been intrigued by the possibility that very small doses of thimerosal 02 g or 1250 of the amount present in a typical vaccine dose can promote an antiviral immune response in that regard low-dose thimerosal might be considered to be a hormetic a substance that is beneficial at low concentrations but inhibitory or toxic at higher concentrations in terms of background in 1979 j b miller reported that influenza vaccine could also be used to treat herpesvirus infections 23 in studying the components of the influenza vaccine it was eventually determined that the antiherpes activity was not related to any influenza virus component of the vaccine rather it was the thimerosal that was responsible 24 further research indicated that low-dose thimerosal was not acting directly against herpes virus influenza virus or other viruses instead low-dose thimerosal might have been signaling an antiviral host response that is immunological in nature in separate studies thimerosal has been shown to induce the th2 immune response andor inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including ifn-gamma il-1 beta il-6 il-12p70 and mcp-1 25 26 furthermore in vitro gene expression profiling experiments with human diploid fibroblast cells indicated that thimerosal at low concentrations 16 to 40 ngml can regulate the expression of specific cytokine chemokine and related immune response genes capable of mediating host immune responses to viral infections mamber unpublished thimerosal can inhibit herpesvirus activity based on in vitro experiments showing viral plaque reduction in treated human keratinocytes but this is believed to result from innate cellular immune responses rather than from direct antiviral effects v gurel unpublished results low-dose thimerosal is currently not commercially available however it has been employed in two fda-approved randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy the first trial a phase lla study evaluated thimerosal for its ability to block progression to lesion in patients with recurrent oral herpes caused by dental trauma while the follow-up phase llb study evaluated the same indication in patients with herpes caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation while the individual clinical trials were underpowered and did not show statistically significant outcomes the outcome data pooled from the two studies that shared a common endpoint did achieve statistical significance beech tree labs unpublished data there has been little experience in employing low-dose thimerosal against coronaviruses to date however the favorable safety profile and the simple formulation and sublingual dosing of low-dose thimerosal make this an interesting candidate for a clinical trial to determine if it can effectively alleviate covid-19 symptoms and severity to further ensure safety in accordance with thimerosal-containing vaccine recommendations by the fda low-dose thimerosal should not be administered to children under 6 years of agephytocannabinoids derived from cannabis sativa such as cannabidiol cbd and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol thc have been shown to inhibit inflammatory and th1 cytokines andor promote anti-inflammatory and th2 immune responses both in vitro and in vivo 2729 as covid-19 represents a respiratory disease with a dominant th1 and inflammatory immune response profile it has been postulated that cannabinoids represent a class of compounds with the potential to alleviate covid-19 symptoms and severity by helping to decrease inflammation and restore a th1th2 balance in the immune system thc for example has been shown to shift the th1th2 cytokine balance in human t cells to one favoring th2 cytokines of particular interest was the inhibition of ifn-gamma production 27 cbd decreased inflammation in a mouse model of lung injury with decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il-6 28 in preliminary studies an oil extract from cannabis sativa containing both cbd and thc upregulated th2 and anti-inflammatory genes such as the il-4 gene encoding il-4 and the pparg gene encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in human small-airway epithelial cells in vitro there were also certain genes involved in mucus overproduction or hypersecretion that were downregulated these included the clca1 gene encoding chloride channel accessory 1 and the cma1 gene encoding mast cell chymase 1 29 preliminary in vivo testing in caribbean vervet monkeys chlorocebus aethiops
sabaeus indicated that the oil extract improved inspiratory lung functions j osborn university of kentucky unpublished data more research will be needed to determine which cannabinoid or cannabinoid mixture might be effective in treating covid-19 symptoms and at what concentrations the method of drug delivery is also a consideration the use of combustible products ie smoking is obviously contraindicated for patients with acute respiratory distress oral ingestion would be the logical delivery method however an oil-based product may be suitable as the active pharmaceutical ingredient api for direct inhalation therapy eg utilization in handheld aerosol inhalers or by nebulized vapor inhalation which may be augmented with oxygen api formulation incipient propellants often use natural oil components such a formulation would offer a convenient treatment method through delivery to the lungsthe four substances described here do not have or are not expected to have direct antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vivo pending further research phytocannabinoids may be an exception which actually would be a positive rather they appear to be acting as immunomodulatory agents modulation of the immune response may be achieved through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines restoring the th1th2 balance or otherwise signaling cells to produce therapeutically beneficial cytokines chemokines and related proteins accordingly such treatments may have the potential to alleviate the immunopathological symptoms caused by sars-cov-2 on the basis of existing in vivo and clinical experiences the optimal time for use of these potential immunomodulatory agents would be at the first signs of disease symptoms when there would be a better chance of reestablishing immune homeostasis one further consideration is the potential disease-modifying utility that these immunomodulators might have in patients with preexisting health conditions including chronic respiratory diseases such as copd such patients may be at the highest risk for severe morbidity and mortality from covid-19 if formal clinical trials are not feasible it is suggested that these substances be investigated in an observational manner under principles of informed consent and compassionate usecoronavirus disease 2019 covid19 which first appeared in wuhan china in december 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world

 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic on 11 march 2020 at the time of writing patients with covid19 had been identified in more than 200 countries worldwide up to 22 may 2020 the number of confirmed cases in china had reached 84 522 of which 4645 individuals had died and 79 738 had been cured in addition to china the number of confirmed cases in other countries had reached 5 146 723 with 330 959 individuals dyingcovid19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 and is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to arise following the sarscov and the middle east respiratory syndromecov in general covid19 is an acute resolved disease but it can also be deadly with a 23 case fatality rate
3
 currently the pathogenesis of covid19 is still poorly understood lung biopsy samples have shown evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which greatly resembles that seen in patients with sars and mers
5
 
6
 one of the main mechanisms for ards in sarscov and merscov infection is the cytokine storm a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune effector cells
7
 
8

10
 a cytokine storm triggers a violent attack by the immune system on the body causing ards and multiple organ failure and finally leading to death however the main cytokines and chemokines involved in sarscov and merscov infections differ

 in covid19 it has been reported that patients being treated on intensive care units icus have higher plasma levels of interleukin2 il2 il7 il10 granulocytecolony stimulating factor interferon inducible protein10 monocyte chemoattractant protein1 macrophage inflammatory protein1a and tumor necrosis factor tnf compared to nonicu patients
2
 regarding other inflammatory factors elevated il6 serum ferritin and creactive protein crp have been most commonly reported in patients with covid19
11

a cytokine storm is also associated with apoptosis of lymphocytes leading to severe and transient lymphopenia
12
 
13

 lymphopenia is a common feature in patients with covid19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality

with increasing evidence on the key pathophysiological role of inflammatory factors in patients with covid19 immunomodulatory agents including corticosteroids tocilizumab and lucitanib have been considered for use in clinics however more laboratory and clinical evidence for their use are neededin this study the characteristics of several inflammatory factors il1 il2 receptor il2r il6 il8 il10 tnf crp serum ferritin and procalcitonin pct and lymphocyte subsets of 27 patients with severe covid19 patients were examined we aimed to find appropriate targets for early intervention in patients with severe covid19 by comparing relevant laboratory indicators before and after treatment we found that levels of il2r il6 tnf and crp decreased significantly after corticosteroid therapy followed by il8 il10 and pct analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed that cd4 and particularly cd8 t lymphocytes increased significantly after treatment however b lymphocytes and natural killer nk cells showed no significant change after treatmentwe recruited 27 patients 14 male and 13 female age 3383 years and median age 60 years who were confirmed to have covid19 by realtime fluorescent rtpcr kit and who had been admitted to tongji hospital from 1 to 21 february 2020 according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol of new coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 from the national health commission of china

il1 and serum ferritin did not change significantly after treatment in fact as described above il1 levels were only elevated slightly in just three female patients serum ferritin however was elevated in all patients and did not decrease significantly after treatment it is likely that this inflammatory factor decreased slower than the otherslymphopenia is very common in covid19 and is associated with disease severity

 in this study lymphopenia occurs in 704 1927 of patients overall levels of white blood cells neutrophils and monocytes were not significantly different before and after treatment pretreatment lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in 21 patients 11 male and 10 female t lymphocytes normal range 9552860l were decreased in 762 1621 of patients and the minimum value was 210l b lymphocytes normal range 90560l were decreased by 238 521 of patients with a minimum was 45l cd4 t lymphocytes normal range 5501440l were decreased by 571 1221 of patients and the minimum was 147l cd8 t lymphocytes normal range 3201250l were decreased in 857 1821 of patients and the minimum was 54l nk cells normal range 1501100l were decreased by 571 1221 of patients and the minimum was 27l lymphopenia improved after treatment in these patients among the lymphocyte subsets the cd8 t lymphocytes showed the most significant improvement followed by cd4 t lymphocytes overall t lymphocytes and total lymphocytes levels improved significantly however the changes in b lymphocytes and nk cells were not significant table 2the covid19 outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians the disease pathogenesis remains to be fully characterized and no pharmacologic therapies of proven efficacy yet exist the immune responses plays important roles in controlling respiratory virus infections
18
 distinct patterns of circulating cytokines and acutephase responses have proven indispensable in guiding the diagnosis and management of respiratory virus infectious diseaseshigher levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with lung damage
19
 il6 il8 and il1 have been reported to contribute to ards
20
 il2r and il6 which appeared to significantly correlate with illness severity by complementing cd8 t cell function
18
 were presented at significantly higher serum levels in our patients with severe covid19 although some studies found that the proinflammatory il1 family including il1 played an important role in the pathogenesis of covid19
2
 
21
 
22
 
23
 the level of il1 was normal in most of our patients and in another study
24
 the level of il8 was increased in only five patients this may be related to the severity of the patients recruited in different study tnf orchestrates the release of chemokines and expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium promoting the rapid and efficient recruitment of leukocytes toward inflammatory foci
25
 
26
 sarscov infection of dendritic cells induces moderate upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf and il6
27
 in our patients with severe covid19 tnf level was increased in most of individuals but by not more than 25 fold of the normal range and decreased significantly after corticosteroid treatment il10 is the central antiinflammatory cytokine
28
 in our study il10 levels increased only in 10 patients and decreased significantly after corticosteroid treatmentcrp plays an important role in innate immunity as an early defense mechanism against infections another inflammatory plasma marker that is extensively used in clinical practice is the ferritin unlike many bacterial infections viral infections are commonly characterized by increased circulating ferritin concentrations
29
 
30
 
31
 
32
 
33
 in our study crp and serum ferritin were increased above normal levels in all patients with severe covid19 but only crp decreased significantly after treatment this is probably because serum ferritin levels decreased at a slower rate but confirmation of this is required pct is known for its sensitivity to bacterial infections
34
 in our investigation the pct level was only slightly increased in patients with severe covid19 with the highest level less than 05 ngml which does not support bacterial infection pct has been investigated for its ability to predict the development of inflammation however the clinical effectiveness of this parameter is controversial
35
 
36
 in our study pct levels decreased significantly after treatmentin our study cd4 and particularly cd8 t lymphocyte subtypes were reduced in patients with severe covid19 which is consistent with the general characteristics of viral pneumonia
37
 and reflects the deficiency of the adaptive immune response previous research on viral infections has indicated that adaptive t cells especially cd8 t cells provide broader and more lasting crossreactive cellular immunity with fewer limitations of strainspecific restriction
38
 histological examination of the lungs of patients who have died of covid19 has revealed interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates dominated by lymphocytes
4
 this finding has been correlated with lower cd4 and cd8 t cell counts in the peripheral blood samples of patients with severe covid19 in general a significantly negative correlation has been reported between the number and function of both cd4 and cd8 t cells
39
 we found that proinflammatory factors were increased significantly in patients with severe covid19 which may be related to the decrease in t lymphocytes after treatment the number of t lymphocytes recovered alongside the decrease in proinflammatory factors the dynamic changes of lymphocytes function in this process need further studyit had been reported that covid19 mostly affected men because immune genes are more expressed on the x chromosome female patients had lower level of inflammatory factors while cd4 t cells were higher with better immune response than in male patients with covid19
40
 but in our patients except tnf most of the level of inflammatory factors and the lymphocyte subsets were not significantly different between male and female patients the differences in the immune response to sarscov2 infection between men and women needs further studyalthough studies have provided evidence that cytokine storms and immunopathology can occur during pathogenic human coronaviruses infections

 we do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the specific factors responsible for exuberant inflammatory responses nonetheless therapeutic interventions targeting these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines could prove beneficial in ameliorating undesirable inflammatory responses corticosteroids are generally used to suppress inflammatory conditions highdose corticosteroids were the mainstay of immunomodulatory therapy during the sars and mers epidemics
45
 
46
 corticosteroid administration often leads to early improvements in terms of reduced fever resolution of radiographic lung infiltrates and better oxygenation
47
 
48
 
49
 however some studies have shown no beneficial effect of corticosteroids while others have demonstrated adverse outcomes following corticosteroid therapy some experts believed there is no clinical data to indicate that a net benefit is derived from corticosteroids in treating respiratory infection due to sarscov or merscov and so corticosteroid treatment should not be used for the treatment of covid19induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial
50
 despite this corticosteroids were used in patients with severe covid19 in china

 but the timing dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy may be critical in the patients included in our study corticosteroids were only used when the patient met the criteria for severe pneumonia including those whose pulmonary imaging progressed greater than 50 in 24 to 48 hours in the current diagnosis and treatment protocol the diagnosis of mild and severe patients with covid19 is mainly based on clinical symptoms signs and pulmonary imaging it had been reported that the difference of the level of inflammation factors particularly il2r il6 and tnf between patients with mild and severe covid19 was significant
24
 in our study the level of the cytokines above was also decreased significantly after the treatment with corticosteroid these findings suggested that the level of inflammatory factors may be a more objective indicator to distinguish mild and severe patients with covid19 and to determine the timing dosage and course of corticosteroid therapy however the cutoff value of these inflammatory factors needs further studysome limitations of this study should also be acknowledged this was a retrospective singlecenter observational study and unavoidable biases occurred when including participants furthermore the sample size was very small despite these limitations the study reflects the real life clinical situationin conclusion a proinflammatory response particularly the level of il2r il6 tnf and crp were associated with severe covid19 the sarscov2 infection affect primarily t lymphocyte particularly cd8 t cells the lymphocytes function in patients with severe covid19 need to be further clarifiedthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsmn researched literature and wrote the first draft of the manuscript fbt and ddx collected the patients clinical data by designed the investigation and reviewed and modified the manuscript all authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscriptthis study received ethical approval from the medical ethics committee of tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science and technology written informed consent for publication of these clinical details was obtained from each patient copies of the consent form are available for review by the editor of this journalafter december 2019 the ongoing death rate due to a novel flu-like coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic has suddenly spread aggressively and continues to increase exponentially the human to human covid-19 sars-cov2 is transmitted through the species barrier due to close contact causing symptoms including extreme fever cough pneumonia acute respiratory disorders multi-organ failure and eventually high mortality among infected patients 1 the symptoms appear between 5 and 15 days the hidden human carriers also risk the transmission of the virus between close contacts 2 nonetheless the exact mechanism of transmission still needs to be checked clinically covid-19 a highly contagious transmissible disease has proven to be resistant to the bodys own defense mechanism with corona cases increasing globally important biological and clinical trends among patients with special conditions are being reportedthe high mortality rate of covid-19 is being largely observed in patients with non-communicable diseases ncds including cardiovascular disease cvd long-term type-2 diabetes t2d and renal disease together along with the elderly population withwithout history of ncds 3 4 more findings are needed however to analyze why vulnerable populations are affected and to define clearly the connection between covid-19 and patients with ncds the covid-19 virus invades the respiratory tract cells and causes thick mucus formation leading to lung damage and the septic shock which was also observed in patients with vulnerability with acute respiratory distress symptoms ards 5 previous studies clinically consider a compromised immune system for ncd patients including smokers and non-smokers 6 7 the affected immune system has a significant effect on the cells metabolic activity and gene expression 8 just as ncds strike people with reduced resistance or impaired health condition the opportunistic covid-19 has mainly impacted patients with ncds with a compromised immune system 9because ncds are the worlds leading cause of death patients receive micronutrient therapy strategies to treat undernutrition improve immunity and prevent infection 10 11 at the un high-level meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases held in new york usa in september 2011 prevention strategies for ncds have already been addressed with a view to prenatal nourishment improving diet and nutrients and preventing undernutrition and infections since ncds are highly dependent on the individual lifestyle 12 dietary intake and environmental conditions and exposure often play a role in each persons personal response to a specific disease 13 the european non-communicable disease prevention and control office ncd office of the world health organization who in cooperation with the russian federation ministry of health has developed a plan to tackle the customized approach to prevention and control of ncds treatment of patients can be personalized to help develop a model that characterizes the phenotype and genotype of patients for a more targeted life-saving treatment due to specific medications and treatment it is noteworthy that this individualized approach has a potential of obtaining positive results for covid-19 patients if individuals are thoroughly tested and treated according to their unique metabolic functionfor covid-19 which largely is controlling the moleculargenetic immune system of the host its complete causal relationship has not been identified with the immune system however changes in covid-19 patients along with the physiological factors can be seen in affected body tissue particularly in the lungs that contribute towards lung injury and ultimately cardiac arrest 14 15 circulative factors such as interleukin factors il-4 il-6 il-10 and il-13 and interferons ifn- tumor necrosis factor tnf- nuclear factor-b nf-b cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ctla4 and toll-like receptors-4 tlr-4 are typically seen in patients with the majority of major ncds 1618 the infection may be targeting gene transcription and regulation of inflammatory markers and chromatin structure machinery of ncd patients 19in addition to the bodys vital functions vitamins have an important role to play in immunopathological and physiological response of the body studies have shown effective treatment for patients with the addition of vitamins and the reduction of inflammatory circulatory markers 20 the highly regulated machinery depends on these epigenetic modifiers obtained mainly from the diet 21 as gene regulation and suppression is evident in various vitamin-regulated mechanisms that control epigenetic changes such as dna methylation histone modification and post-translation modifications 22 23 inflammatory markers are widely known to be controlled by such micronutrients as well 2427 both fat- and water-soluble vitamins have proven to be crucial to epigenetic modification to strengthen the immune system and cell growth of an organism as important micronutrients for patients with ncds 28because there is currently no clinically approved covid-19 medication or vaccine available attempts to improve the immunity of ncd patients with covid-19 vitamin deficiencies should also be tested the tests would fulfill the requirement to track and regulate proper metabolic activity and immune reactions towards enhanced inflammatory markers clinical evidence also suggests that vitamin c is beneficial against sars coronavirus 29 and covid-19 is 82 comparable with sars-cov 30 31 there is also an urgent need to reduce high mortality rates due to covid-19 and concentrate on an innovative and individual patient strategy to boost therapy effectiveness the general associations and conclusions identified and reviewed suggest the value of micronutrients to public health experts and so it is strongly recommended that clinical professionals investigate the alternative treatment furthermultiple pathways are activated in ncds patients with ncds are more prone to infections which can be related with high mortality rates 32 as also observed in covid-19 patients mechanisms may be linked to vitamin deficiency and its effects that lead to impaired immune response therefore early intervention of both clinical and individual preventive and control strategies to help prevent the spread of the infection is important particularly in people with compromised immunity the widespread distribution of covid-19 has shown a high mortality rate in ncds and in people with low immunity a new holistic approach to providing people with the right vitamin doses can lead to more effective and individual centric therapy scientific and clinical data show that immune responses in cvd t2d ards cancer renal diseases and autoimmune disorders are strongly compromised genetic control of inflammatory markers should be considered as clinically relevant circulatory markers for covid-19 in individuals with the abovementioned ncds the fact that vitamins have been recognized as epigenetic modifications in gene expression in methylation citrullination acetylation and phosphorylation 33 can be clinically associated as can be seen in table 1 clinical evidence suggests that ncd patients are highly specific with immune sensitive molecules and are deficient in certain types of vitamins 52fatal outcomes have been found in covid-19 patients causing acute myocardial injury mi and chronic damage epidemiological data consistently show an increased risk of crp tlr4 and il-6 with subsequent cardiovascular events 3436 the cvd incidence history shows an altered polymorphism of the  174gc that suggests a possibility for cv event in patients along with the snp variant of the crp gene with higher plasma levels 37 on the other hand the circulating tlr-4 signal also promotes myocardial infarction active vitamin d metabolite signaling pathways control various interleukin factor including il-6 crp and tlr 53 the epigenetics of this clearly illustrates that vitamin d deficiency is observed in cvd patients 38 with other promoter elements also regulated by vitamins a e and b912 it is worth noting that covid-19 increases the risk of cvd among patients and may be causing over-expression of immune response factors that influence the risk of cv events for covid-19 patients due to vitamin deficiencies t2d individuals have significant levels of il-4 il-10 il-13 and ifn- and tnf- 54 individuals having a highly compromised immune system can be explained due to impaired insulin secretion over-stressed cell organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress and glucotoxicity 55 the cellular stress in t2d induces inflammatory response due to specific cytokines and chemokines 56 in addition to t2d patients being prone to infections the patients suffer from vitamins b9 folic acid b12 a c and e deficiencies 43 hence absence in maintenance of chromatin structure of cell genome increased apoptosis and absence of protein integrity overall there is complete absence of epigenetic control of cellular processes in t2d individuals making them susceptible to infectious diseasesscientific evidence shows ards patients to express nf-b and gr leading to dysregulated mechanisms which leads to up- or down-regulation of various pro-inflammatory mediators and increased oxidative stress 57 transcriptional mediators such as nf-b expressed in ards are attenuated by vitamin c however vitamin d and e deficiency in ards patients also indicate absence of epigenetic control on gene transcription due to possible absence of proper dna methylation and histone modification status in the cells 44 which may contribute towards dysregulated transcriptional mechanism patients with covid-19 tend to develop severe immune activation in lungs 14 and hence pneumonia the clinical link between active inflammatory pathways in ards and the vitamin deficiency clearly indicates why covid-19 causes high mortality in patients with chronic lung diseasesepidemiological data confirm higher prevalence of cancer patients with covid-19 cancer patients with history of immunosuppressants who are covid-19 positive are also facing worse outcomes 58 ctl4a and pd1 are two of the main immune adaptive response regulators that inhibit the normal t-regulatory cell in cancer-stricken patients inhibition of both tumor markers resulted in clinical trials to provide anti-ctl4a and anti-pd1 antibodies for cancer therapy which may be useful for regulating a t cell proliferation signaling pathway 59 60 the possible balance between controlling ctl4a and pd1 expression 48 as well as providing vitamin d supplements 61 has shown increased t-lymphocytic proliferation expressing high vdr in cancer patients triggering the t cell differentiation immune response the evidence clearly shows the degree of clinical infection manifestations in cancer patients with positive covid-19 testfatalities in kidney patients are also investigated provided that covid-19 patients with ongoing kidney and renal disease are controlled with a high degree of caution 62 63 signs of kidney dysfunction include elevated proteinuria urea and serum potassium hematuria and other clinical co-morbidity 64 patients with a history of failure of kidney disease develop inflammation which contributes to the activation of the adaptive immunity of increased th1th2 ratios and to t and b lymphocyte autoantibodies 51 infectious pathogens may easily enter the kidney patients this possibility should also be timely addressed in covid-19 patients to prevent end-stage renal diseases esrd in kidney patients vitamin d is discovered to be deficient putting them at risk of ckd and hyperparathyroidism the vitamin suppresses most of the adaptive immune system which can play an important role in protecting the host against first-line defense invasion of covid-19 in the covid-19 patients with kidney transplant 65 vitamin d may prove effective and this may also prevent graft rejection and regulate th1th2 ratiosmicronutrient therapy to be considered and given should be individual centric and based upon time and dose-response manner vitamin therapy seems feasible at this time due to absence of the vaccine or medication available for care to prevent multiple organ failure and immunologic deaths among covid-19-positive patients with ncd table 2 summarizes the vitamins that control the immunomodulatory elements and the mechanism of action if the population receives the right dose of vitamins specific to ncd and inflammatory factors expressed effects on respiratory health can be observed as dna methylation histone modification and enzyme control and the proper cell division of healthy cells can be regulated this personalized therapy recommends a medical model that should characterize the covid-19-positive individuals for diagnosis based on the type of ncdsbased on primary observation on previous evidences the types of vitamin combinations which can be given to patients are shown in table 3 based on clinical evidence the table combines the types of vitamins which can be selected to enhance the immunity of patients to reduce the inflammatory response in ncd patients there is strong need for personalized treatment for covid-19 patients suffering from ncd as an alternative therapy 88 the compilation of literature shown in table 3 citing clinical evidence for a potential vitamin link in the control of immune expression of inflammatory markers to treat an infectious pandemic 89 needs to be clinically validated as vitamins regulate the epigenetic machinery age sex smoking ethnicity and other environmentallifestyle factors are also affected by changes to immune response several ncds are driven by genomic instability hypermethylation and hypomethylation of promoter gene regions involved in immunological marker and element regulation treating vitamins as major epigenetic modifiers will prove to be an effective approach to customized treatment particularly for covid-19 patients with different background factors that could have contributed in the past to develop the specific ncd vitamin therapy can be an effective and safe treatment as a custom drug in covid-19 patients the storm of inflammatory or cytokine factors should be tested by assessing patients for different inflammatory markers and vitamin deficiency in order to provide a metabolism for an individual against vitamin deficiency all individuals should be screened for specific immune cell reactions and the factors represented by the specific ncd the combination will improve care and lead to a more personalized approach an exhaustive review is also needed for other factors such as pregnancy and other medical conditions this can be used as time progresses and new clinical data for covid-19 patients are availablethis study can serve as a primary link to open ways to look at important facts to cure people otherwise having compromised immune systems due to ncds this may include more studies and recommendation of personalized approach for patients to be treated the benefit is that vitamin therapy has no side effect and has proven to be effective the micronutrient combination is also recommended for the target population without ncd or help early in its prevention of infectious diseases for patients at risk for covid-19 other factors such as smoking and drinking should not be overlooked this will also extend guidelines and policy changes to undernutrition and infections in low- and middle-income countries therefore opportunistic infections can be better controlled in the future with low mortality rate and vitamins can serve as useful epigenetic modifiers to genetically target and modify transcriptional and translational control of various inflammatory markersthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 global epidemic progresses relentlessly 1 a range of clinical manifestations of covid-19 disease occurs from mild moderate severe to fulminant pulmonary disease have been described sars-cov-2 infection is associated with a 34 mortality rate the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection remains unknown whilst most patients develop mild disease fever runny nose malaise dry cough and fatigue with a good prognosis others develop a severe pneumonia characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure with high rate of intensive unit care admission icu 24 immunological studies of patients with two other lethal zoonotic coronavirus infections sars-cov and mers-cov suggest underlying immune-based pathogenic mechanisms with lymphopenia with exacerbated dysregulated inflammatory responses that correlate with disease severity 57 lymphopenia and increase in inflammatory mediators were reported in severe covid-19 disease 28 and a longitudinal study suggested that the neutrophillymphocyte ratio could be an important prognostic factor for early identification of severe covid-19

statistically significant statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism v80 graphpad software incwe performed the immunological profiling of 18 sars-cov-2-infected patients 9 with severe and 9 with mild diseases at admission the analysis of wbc count showed a significant lower lymphocytes count and frequency and a parallel higher neutrophil count and frequency in severe than in mild covid-19 patients fig 1a b nevertheless we performed a longitudinal analysis in four severe and in four mild patients in order to analyze the immunological changes during the course of the covid-19 the kinetic of leucocytes showed an increase in neutrophil count paralleled by an early and rapid decrease of lymphocytes during the course of severe diseases fig 1b a similar kinetic was also observed for the neutrophils and lymphocytes percentage fig 1c in contrast the patients with mild disease quickly exhibited a leucocyte count and frequency within the normal range fig 1b c flow cytometric analysis of t-cell subsets showed no major differences among patients with severe or mild symptoms fig 1dthe differentiation profile and activation markers in cd4 and cd8 t cells showed during the early phase of the disease a lower frequency of precursor cd4 t cells with a parallel higher frequency of effector memory em cd4 t cells in blood from patients with severe covid-19 infection fig 2a a lower frequency of precursor cd8 t cells was observed in patients with severe disease with a parallel higher frequency of em and terminally differentiated temra cd8 t cells fig 2bthe activation profile analysis of cd4 and cd8 t cells showed a high frequency of cd95 expressing cd4 and cd8 t cells in patients with severe covid-19 infection that persisted during the entire follow-up suggesting strong t-cell activation the patients with a mild disease showed a lower frequency of cd95-positive immune cells as compared with the four patients with severe clinical presentation in cd4 and in cd8 t cells fig 2c d the expression of cd38 on cd4 and cd8 did not revealed evident differences fig 2c d cytotoxicity was further evaluated due to the high frequency of temra t cells defined by perforin in innate nk and adaptive immune cells fig 3a blood from patients with severe disease exhibited a high frequency of perforin-expressing t cells at day 4 58 in patient 1 and 57 in patient 2 which decreased at day 13 133 and 141 respectively and day 18 68 and 81 respectively in contrast t cells from the patient with mild disease did not express perforin early after admission d1 both in severe and mild patients all nk cells persistently expressed perforin early after admission until the convalescent phasethe level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 was found to be high at the time of admission in two out of four patients followed by a rapid decrease at day 8 with a slight increase at days 1416 post admission in three out of four severe patients fig 3b a similar kinetic was observed also for il-8 il-1 and tnf- showing an increase at late stage of disease mild patients showed a persisting low level of all the inflammatory mediators during all the course of infectionthe level of tgf- was found to be higher in plasma from patients with severe disease which decreased over time in the early convalescent phases around day 14 after admission the levels of the inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-8 and tnf increased in parallel with a decrease in tgf- fig 3b in all three patientswe observed the presence of granulocytic cells after pbmc isolation by ficoll fig 4a since it has been clearly demonstrated the stratification of the pmn-mdsc subset in the ficoll mononuclear fraction we better characterize this cell population we found that indeed these cells were hla-dr lin cd33 cd11b as described for mdsc fig 4b moreover they expressed cd15 and not cd14 fig 4b indicating the presence of the pmn-mdsc subset we found a higher pmn-mdsc frequency in both covid-19 groups than hd and a higher frequency in severe than mild patients fig 4c mdsc are defined primarily by their immunosuppressive functions which was confirmed by ex vivo isolated mdscs that were able to inhibit strongly t-cell proliferation fig 5 pbmcs from patients with severe and mild covid-19 infection failed to proliferate reflecting an ex vivo suppressive environment as mdsc were depleted from the patients pbmcs immune cell proliferative capacity was restored particularly in the patients with severe clinical presentation from 02 to 506  after mdsc depletion when mdsc were added again t-cell proliferation was strongly reduced from 506 to 345 fig 5ac sebstimulation of immune cells showed that depletion of mdscs resulted in a strong increase of ifn- and tnf- production vice versa adding of mdsc decreased ifn- and tnf- fig 5bd confirming the biological activity of ex vivo isolated mdscs in patients with severe covid-19 infectionthe pmn-mdsc longitudinal analysis showed a substantial early increase in pmn-mdsc frequency in all patients with the severe covid-19 presentation up to 917 in patient 2 at day 5 after admission in contrast blood from all patients with mild covid-19 infection exhibited a lower increase of mdscs frequency ie lower as compared with patients with severe disease presentation fig 6 mdscs decreased over time yet were still found to be increased during the early convalescent phase as compared with the frequency of mdscs in blood from mild individuals whose mdsc frequency were stable over time day 18 fig 6most patients with covid-19 show mild disease whilst an estimated 20 progress to severe pneumonia respiratory failure and in 3 2 cases death 1 there are several findings from the current study first lymphopenia which has been found to be a common clinical feature in patients with covid-19 2 seen in our four cases with severe disease whilst lymphopenia may turn out to be a clinically relevant finding associated with disease severity and mortality 3 we did not identify any specific t-cell subsets to be preferentially affected second a massive expansion of functional mdscs reaching up to 90 of total pbmcs in severe covid-19 disease associated with a strong activation of the immune system third in the later convalescent phase of disease severe cases the reduction of mdsc frequency was associated with an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines along with reduction of tgf- indicating a relationship between mdsc expansion and reduction of inflammation mdsc expansion is a common response to most inflammatory processes and the functions of mdscs are highly dependent on the inflammatory environment fourth our findings of t-cell activation differentiation and cytotoxic profile indicates that hyperactivation of both the innate and adaptive immune arms of the immune system may be a hallmark of severe disease and play a role in covid-19 pathogenesis this is supported by findings seen in the four patients with severe disease 1 increased frequency of differentiated t cells both cd4 and cd8 t cells with a reduction in precursor t cells and a parallel increase of em cd4 and temra cd8 t cells 2 persistence of highly activated t cells 3 a very high frequency of cytotoxic t and nk cells and 4 a higher inflammatory response il-6the expansion of mdscs can be induced by several factors eg plasma elevation of prostaglandins m-csf g-csf gm-csf il-6 and vegf 10 it is therefore possible that mdsc expansion in patients with severe disease could be driven by hyperactivation of the immune system excessive inflammatory mediators and growth factors as recently described by huang et al in patients with covid-19 infection admitted to the icu 2 according to this model the patient with mild disease showed an undisturbed t-cell differentiation profile and lower frequencies of immune cells exhibiting an activationcytotoxic profile this was paralleled by lower frequencies of mdsc compared with patients with severe disease these mdscs appear to be highly functional irrespective of the disease severity mdscs both from patients with severe and mild symptoms strongly suppressed t-cell proliferation and cytokine production the fact that ex vivo mdsc depletion restored t-cell functions confirmed their potential suppression function in vivo accordingly high il-6 levels have been recently associated with fatal covid-19 infection 11 suggesting that immune suppression possibly mediated by expanded mdscs could be highly beneficial in reducing inflammation and lung damage induced by hyperactivated cytotoxic cells 12 on the other hand we could not rule out the possible detrimental role of expanded mdsc in inhibiting a protective cytotoxic immune responsethe suppressive functions of mdscs are mediated by several molecular pathways including inducible nitric oxide synthetase arginase-1 nadph oxidase and tgf- 10 mdscs can inhibit several immune cell functions such as t-cell proliferation and activation 1316 cytokine production by macrophages 17 and nk-cell function 18 they are also involved in the induction of t regulatory cells 19 playing a pivotal role in regulating immune response furthermore a correlation between th17 and mdsc has been described in several disease settings 20 21 high level of plasmatic il-17 has been reported during covid-19 22 however its correlation with mdsc remains to be elucidatedmdsc expansion is a response to most inflammatory processes in order to curb excessive and potentially harmful immune responses several conditions associated with excessive inflammation result in aberrant myelopoiesis characterized by accumulation of myeloid cells with regulatory functions mdsc are a heterogeneous cell population at different stages of differentiation comprising myeloid cell progenitors and mature cells 23 that expand under certain pathological conditions such as cancer inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disorders 1315 24 25 two major mdsc subsets have been identified in humans the monocytic-mdsc and pmn-mdsc subsets expressing low level of hla-dr myeloid markers as cd11b and cd33 and cd14 or cd15 respectively 13 patients experiencing viral infections other than covid-19 were found to have high levels of mdscs for example in patients with dengue infection the expansion of mdsc correlates with dengue virus viral load clinical severity score and a decrease in fever 26 in general mdsc may reduce immune activation in acute infection thus dampening immune pathogenesis as shown in a sepsis model 27 mdscs were first studied in patients with cancer yet were found to modulate immune responses in infectious diseases as well as in other inflammatory conditions 1315 24 25 although clinical treatments have been developed to downregulate mdscs in patients with cancer in order to restore productive anti-tumour immune responses 25 recent studies suggest that mdscs may even play a positive role in acute inflammatory processes by dampening potential harmful non-protective immune responses 27 28 for instance mdsc expansion during dengue infection downregulates the inflammatory response and subsequently immune-mediated pathology 26in sepsis mdsc seems to play a dual role depending on the disease progression they are beneficial by reducing inflammation during the early stages of sepsis thus protecting from early organ dysfunction at a later stage of the disease mdscs can be detrimental by amplifying long-term immunosuppression 2729 our data suggest a protective role of mdsc expanded early during the acute phase of the covid-19 reducing t-cell hyperactivation and inflammation but on the other hand they can dramatically dampen the protective immune response this finding is in line with previous observations in bacterial or fungal infections namely that a strong pro-inflammatory response is followed by a counter-regulatory process that has been coined as immune paralysis 30 this information is clinically meaningful since restoration of immune competence during immune paralysis has been achieved for example with ifn-gamma 31 or with il-7 32 and found to be associated with improved clinical outcomethe dynamic nature of the immune response during covid-19 infection described in this report underlines that longitudinal sampling is needed in order to define the best time point for therapeutic interventionsdepending on the status of the hyper-inflammatory or hypo-inflammatory disease process although including a limited number of patients this study shows a huge expansion of mdsc in severe covid-19 associated to a reduction of inflammatory mediators the protective role of mdsc needs to be further evaluated and confirmed in studies with larger cohorts of patients with severe covid-19 disease in order to tailor specific immune-mediated interventions andor define a possible role of mdscs as markers of disease activitycoronaviruses a genus of the coronaviridae family are enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand ribonucleic acid rna genome 1 the genomic rna is 2732 kb in size capped and polyadenylated coronaviruses were identified in several non-human species including rats mice chickens cattle turkeys swine cats dogs rabbits and horses in these species coronavirus infection often causes devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases several coronaviruses such as hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were identified since the mid-1960s prior to the sars-cov outbreak coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild self-limiting respiratory infections in humans commonly referred at as colds these viruses are endemic among the human populations causing 1530 of respiratory tract infections each year rarely these viruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections especially in neonates in the elderly and in individuals with underlying illnessessars-cov a novel coronavirus was identified in 2002 as the pathogenic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that occurred in in the guangdong province of china 2 so far sars is the most severe human disease caused by a coronavirus recent evidence confirmed that the sars-cov virus originated from a mutation occurring in a non-human host probably bats gains the ability to affect humans luckily the transmission of sars-cov was relatively inefficient since its spread occurred only through direct contact with infected individuals with negligible infectivity during incubation state the outbreak was largely contained within households and healthcare settingsa novel human coronavirus named middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov emerged in the middle east in 2012 as the causative agent of a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in saudi arabia and other countries in the middle east 3 in the early stages of the outbreak a high mortality rate of 50  was reported but the outbreak did not accelerate through 2013 and by the end of 2014 it was largely controlled also for this virus a zoonotic origin is suspected since dromedary camels may be its natural hostsin early december 2019 several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in wuhan china the pathogen was identified as a novel enveloped rna  coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 the virus showed phylogenetic similarities to both sars-cov and mers-cov viruses in view of its similarities to bat coronaviruses it was postulated that bats could have been the primary hosts of sars-cov-2 this hypothesis suggested that the infection originated via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the huanan seafood wholesale market on january 30th 2020 the world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and on march 11th who director general referred to covid-19 as a pandemic as of may 5th 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has exceeded 3 million worldwide with more than 250000 covid-19-related deaths the epidemic has put public health systems under severe strain both in western countries and in the developing world sars-cov-2 displays a more efficient transmission pattern when compared with sars-cov and mers-cov 5 retaining a high transmission rate also in the asymptomatic incubation period 6 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 syndrome varies remarkably going from asymptomatic forms to acute bilateral pneumonias requiring hospitalization common presenting symptoms include fever fatigue and dry cough while laboratory tests often show lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity a significant percentage of cases requires admission to intensive-care-units icu due to acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation support a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 can experience the so-called cytokine storm syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia associated with multi-organ failurethe term cytokine storm has become increasingly used not only by authors of scientific articles but also by popular media it is likely that the widespread use of this term is related with its rather immediate meaning which actually recalls the role of the immune system in producing an uncontrolled and generalized inflammatory response 7 it seems not casual that the term cytokine storm was first employed in describing the events modulating the onset of the graft-versus-host disease 8 a condition characterized by an impressively powerful activation of the immune system cytokine storms characterize a wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious diseases and since 2005 it was associated to the avian h5n1 influenza virus infection 9 apart from the immediate significance of the term cytokine storm the biological and clinical consequences of this immune system hyperactivity are by far less known making it worthwhile to be briefly overviewedthere are several similarities in the clinical features between covid-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections shared clinical findings include that most patients present with fever dry cough dyspnea and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest ct scans 10 however the physiopathology of the mechanisms through which sars-cov or mers-cov sustain high pathogenicity are yet to be completely unveiledsince the first reports on covid-19 disease it appeared clear that acute respiratory distress syndrome ards accounted for a significant number of deaths among infected patients and that ards should be regarded as the hallmark immune-mediated clinical consequence in sars-cov-2 similarly to what described for sars-cov and mers-cov infections11 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a devastating event with an estimated mortality of approximately 40 defined as the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and severe hypoxemia ards can occur in a variety of clinical situations including pneumonia sepsis pancreatitis blood transfusion ards pathogenesis involves inflammatory injury to the alveolocapillary membrane which results in increased lung permeability and the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid into the airspaces leading in the end to respiratory insufficiency 12as shown by previous data in the literature increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg interferon  interleukin il- 1b il-6 il-12 and chemokines cxcl10 and ccl2 are associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement in sars patients similarly to what happens in mers-cov infection 13 as far as covid 19 infection is concerned huang et al recently reported that infected patients also show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 4 the demonstration of increased levels of il-1b ifn cxcl10 and ccl2 strongly pointed toward an activation of t-helper-1 th1 cell function more importantly the so called cytokine storm emerged as a main factor driving a more severe clinical course this concept originated from the observation that covid-19 patients requiring icu admission displayed higher concentrations of cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf as compared to those in which the infection was less severe and did not require an icu admission to further complicate the issue it should be highlighted that in patients with sars-cov-2 infection at difference from sars-cov infection there is also an increased secretion th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 whose main effect is to suppress inflammation14taken together these data clearly indicate that in sars-cov infection ards is the ultimate result of a cytokine storm in this scenario the release by immune effector cells of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn ifn il-1 il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf tgf and chemokines cxcl10 cxcl8 cxcl9 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 precipitates and sustains the aberrant systemic inflammatory response 4131516 the cytokine storm is readily followed by the immune system attacking the body which in turn will cause ards and multiple organ failure the final result being death at least in the most severe cases of sars-cov-2 infection 11the cytokine storm and the consequent ards results from the effects of a combination of many immune-active molecules interferons interleukins chemokines colony-stimulating factors and tnf-alpha represent the main components involved in the development of the cytokine storm and will be briefly overviewed- interferons a family of cytokines with a central role in virus-directed innate immunity binds specific receptors and result in the expression of genes encoding protein with anti-viral or immunomodulatory properties this sequence of events supported the therapeutic use of ifns in some viral diseases such as chronic hepatitis but also in non-viral conditions including leukemia and lymphoma melanoma and multiple sclerosis 1718- tumor necrosis factor  tnf is a pyrogen cytokine released from immune cells in the acute phase of inflammation and infection it is a central cytokine in viral diseases and is associated with a number of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 19- colony-stimulating factors csf these proteins are associated with inflammatory conditions and are components of an amplification cascade which ultimately increases cytokine production by macrophages at sites of inflammation this effect perpetuates the inflammatory reaction 20- interleukins are a family of cytokines involved in immune cells differentiation and activation they mediate the traffic of immune cells to the site of the infection induce the increase of the acute phase signaling activate epithelial cells and mediate the production of secondary cytokines 21 among them interleukin-6 il-6 deserves a more extensive discussion in view of its involvement in the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm il-6 is crucially involved in acute inflammation due to its role in regulating the acute phase response 21 it is produced by almost all stromal cells and b lymphocytes t lymphocytes macrophages monocytes dendritic cells mast cells and other non-lymphocytic cells such as fibroblasts endothelial cells keratinocytes glomerular mesangial cells and tumor cells 22 the production of this cytokine is increased by il-1 and tumor necrosis factor tnf- 23 il-6 may also be responsible for the activation of t helper 17 th17 cells in the dendritic cell-t cell interaction 24 in covid-19 affected patients a high th17 cells activation could result from a virus-driven increased production of il-6 by the immune system il-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm owing to its pleiotropic properties several studies showed that the serum levels of il-6 are increased in covid-19 patients and that its circulating levels are positively related to disease severity 142526 for this reason high serum il-6 levels were suggested as predictors for disease severity 2728 indeed in animal models of sars-cov infection the inhibition of the transcription factor of il-6 and in turn of its production was associated with reduced mortality 29during the present covid-19 pandemic the use of tocilizumab as a therapeutic agent was proposed tocilizumab is a humanized anti-il-6 receptor igg1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases 14 by blocking the il-6-receptor interaction tocilizumab inhibits the il-6-mediated signal transduction although clinical data on the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 patients derive from small series some authors recommend its use in critically ill covid-19 patients with significantly elevated il-6 levels 14
-chemokines are a large family of cytokines characterized by a powerful chemotactic effect chemokinesact as chemo-attractants in the migration of the immune system cells but they are also involved in several other processes including the development and function of innate and adaptive immune system embryogenesis and cancer metastasis 3031 they are promptly secreted by a variety of cells in response to viral or microbial infections 32chemokines act as powerful chemoattractants which recruit inflammatory cells to migrate from the intravascular space across the endothelium and epithelium into the inflammation site according to a chemokine gradient33 the role of one specific chemokine cxcl10 previously referred to as interferon- inducible protein of 10 kda or ip-10 has been highlighted in ards in both experimental models and in patientsindeed in a mouse model of il-2 induced ards an up-regulation of the mouse cxcl10 analogue mob-1 mrna was observed at initiation of lung injury 34 several studies also showed that the intratracheal injection of mob-1 in mice induced pulmonary migration of leukocytes in the alveolar space with massive recruitment of neutrophils especially monocytes this event was rapidly followed by microvascular injury and pulmonary edema typical of ards 3536 cxcl10 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the onset of ards as shown in mice models of ards induced by either acid aspiration or by viral infection with influenza h5n1 virus briefly ichikawa et al demonstrated that wild-type mice developing ards had increased levels of cxcl10 mainly due to an increased secretion by infiltrating neutrophils which induced an autocrine loop mechanism on the chemotaxis of inflamed neutrophils leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation on the contrary cxcl10 andor its receptor cxcr3 knock-out mice showed decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to both viral and non-viral lung injury 37 moreover cxcl10 expression in the lung was significantly up-regulated after induction of ards with lipopolysaccharide lps in a mouse model of lung injury and the neutralization of cxcl10 with anti-cxcl10 antibody lead to amelioration of lung injury38cxcl8 also referred at as il-8 is another chemokine considered as a potential prognostic bio-marker for ards clinical course 39 indeed cxcl8 levels were found to be elevated both in plasma 40 41 42 43 and in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid 44 45 46 of patients with ards a direct role of cxcl8 in the progression of ards was proven in rabbit with acid-induced ards lead to a 10-fold increase in cxcl8 levels in the alveolar fluids of note pre-treatment with an anti-cxcl8 antibody prevented the development of the typical acute lung injury47although chemokines are crucially involved in the regulation and maintenance of immune responses their role in the onset of the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm is still poorly investigatedbefore addressing the specific relationship between chemokines and coronavirus infections it is mandatory to briefly overview the general role of chemokines in viral infections and how viruses contrast the actions of chemokinesviruses are infectious agents of small size and simple composition that can multiply only in living cells of animals plants or bacteria all viruses contain a nucleic acid either -dna deoxyribonucleic acid or -rna ribonucleic acid and several proteins viruses should not even be considered organisms since they are not free-living ie they require a host cell thus viruses need to elude the host immune defense to infect its cells in order to reproduce and survive 54the chemokinechemokine receptor-related immune defenses are the main obstacles to be by-passed by viruses some chemokines play a direct anti-viral effect by inducing an array of phenomena that lead cells to determine an anti-viral state these phenomena include activation of apoptosis or direct killing of infected cells by activated immune cells chemokines also recruit immune cells to the site of infection which will fight against the intruder 55 viral infections are associated with enhanced expression of several chemokines in particular the interferons-inducible ones interferons which can be produced by any mammalian cell are involved in the rapid and efficient host innate response against viruses a powerful ifn response triggered by the first contact with a virus can slow down viral multiplication and buy time for the organism to establish a more efficient adaptive immune response 56 ifns can stimulate surrounding cells to express potent antiviral proteins including enzymes transcription factors cell surface glycoproteins cytokines and chemokines 5758 moreover they can inhibit cell proliferation regulate apoptosis and modulate the immune response 59 among interferons-induced molecules the chemokine cxcl10 is currently regarded as a main player in the organism anti-viral response 60 and particularly in respiratory tract infections several studies demonstrated that cxcl10 levels as evaluated in serum bronchial-alveolar washing fluid or nasal secretions consistently correlate with the severity and duration of acute respiratory tract infection due to viral infections 60 61 62also the chemokine cxcl8 is involved in inflammation and immune cell trafficking in the context of viral infections cxcl8 plays a major role in the initial control of respiratory tract infection due to its chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes 63 cxcl8 levels in the nasal washing fluid correlate with symptoms severity during acute respiratory tract infections 64 although in the majority of cases a strong chemokine action can efficiently contrast viral infections some viruses acquire the capacity of escaping this surveillance system furthermore viruses can use the chemokine system network for their own favor by several strategies-some viruses mimic the components of the chemokine system by producing molecules that are very similar to chemokines and can interact with their receptor these molecules generate an incongruous signal leading to a disorganized immune response to viruses 65-inhibition of the interferon-induced anti-viral response several viruses do impair the intracellular receptors devoted to pathogen recognition such as toll like receptors and intracellular rna sensors 66
taken together the above data indicate that viruses can interfere with the chemokinechemokine-receptors system using their own properties to modify intracellular signaling with the final result to further disseminate the infectionsince the first reports of sars it seemed clear that the severe clinical manifestations of the disease could not be ascribed only to the viral activity per se but that an immune-mediated mechanism rather than a direct virus-induced damage would drive the clinical progression 67 indeed from the physio-pathology point of view the most interesting observation was the demonstration that viral titers seemed to paradoxically diminish during the most severe phase of the disease both in humans and in several animal models 1 data coming from patients series described during the 2003-2004 epidemics clearly suggested that complex alterations in the chemokine system were related to the outcome of sars-cov infection fig 1

in vivo studies showed that several circulating chemokines cxcl8 ccl2 and cxcl10 and inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 were elevated in patients with sars-cov 6869 cxcl10 was also considered an excellent prognostic marker for sars disease progression 7071 in particular jiang et al showed that cxcl 10 serum levels were significantly increased during the early stage of sars and remained elevated until resolution moreover persistently elevated cxcl10 serum levels during follow-up were predictive of a worse outcome of the infection 71these findings prompted further in vitro studies aimed at investigating the relationship between sars and the chemokine system spiegel et al demonstrated that in addition to its direct effect on epithelial lung cells sars-cov could also enter macrophages and dendritic cells 72 this appeared crucial as viral entrance in these cells lead to an abortive infection eg the virus enters the host-cell but cannot successfully complete replication yet the virus elicited the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by dendritic and macrophages cells 73 this finding was confirmed in vivo because the serum levels of a wide spectrum of cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and macrophages were elevated in sars-cov infected patients 74 furthermore the infection with sars-cov of human primary myeloid-derived dendritic cells was followed by an impaired defensive ifn response which was paralleled by a moderate up-regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 and a much more significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines such as cxcl10 ccl3 ccl5 and ccl2 75 the authors suggested that the lack of response to antiviral interferons in the presence of chemokine up-regulation could represent a further mechanism of immune evasion by sars-cov 73 in line with this hypothesis the direct exposure of lung epithelial cells 76 or peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs 75 coming from sars infected patients to viral proteins such as s-protein and n-protein induced a prompt release of several chemokines including cxcl8 and cxcl10 in vitro gene-expression studies also reported that pbmc from normal healthy donors inoculated with sars-cov showed an early enhancement in the expression of several chemokines belonging both to the cc family ccl4 ccl20 ccl22 ccl25 ccl27 and their receptors ccr4 ccr7 and of the cxcl family cxcl8 and il-17 77 additional data came from animal models of sars-cov infection in mice infected with sars-cov the clinical features of the syndrome showed an age-dependent increase in severity similarly to what observed in humans which was related to an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines paralleled by a reduction in t-cell responses 78 another study showed that in mice infected with sars-cov robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type i interferon secretion caused a rapidly fatal pneumonia this delayed type i-interferon signaling promoted the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages with resulting increase in cytokine il-6 and chemokine ccl2 lung levels vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific t cell responses 79these data suggest that coronaviruses and in particular sars-cov have a peculiar ability to counteract the antiviral ifn response pointing toward the fact that the severity of disease might be due to immune dysregulation rather than to the level of viremia this dysregulation would be characterized by an insufficient type i interferon response too little and too late paralleled by an aberrant pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion by alveolar macrophages dendritic cells and pneumocytes 6680
in vitro data suggest that this class of viruses and in particular sars-cov uses several strategies to avoid type i ifn response both passive and active 5659-passive mechanisms include the induction of double membrane vesicles dmv at perinuclear sites within the cytoplasm where rna synthesis takes place this strategy may help to hide and protect rna replication intermediates from being sensed by intracellular rna-sensors thus avoiding the activation of the ifn cascade 8182-active mechanisms include a direct action of viral proteins on transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules that regulate the ifn cascade in particular the sars-cov protein orf6 is able to inhibit the action of interferon regulatory transcription factor-3 irf-3 a transcription factor of the ifn genes 8384
the fact that sars-cov infection would upregulate the transcription of cxcl10 while significantly down-regulating ifns signaling could seem paradoxical however transcriptional enhancement of cxcl10 could be due to a direct effect on the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-kb 85 triggered by sars-cov86 even if other authors did not confirm this early observation 87 similarly the up-regulation of the cxcl8 gene expression could be due to a direct effect of the virus at the cellular level indeed intestinal and lung cells lines infected by sars-cov promptly increase their secretion of cxcl8 88 this observation would fit with the notion that the expression of cxcl8 is dependent on the transcription factor activator protein 1 ap-1 which was shown to be strongly up-regulated by sars-cov 8689during the mers-cov epidemics several studies were aimed at understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severe and often fatal pneumonia were performed available data suggest that mers-cov infection shares some immunological aspects of sars-cov infection in terms of involvement of the chemokine system first an increase in the serum levels of cxcl10 when compared to controls was observed also in mers-cov patients more importantly a persistent cxcl10 increase was associated with disease severity 90in this regard the case of two paradigmatic patients diagnosed with mers-cov is worth noting one had a fatal outcome and experienced an impaired ifn response together with a relevant increase in serum cxcl10 levels the other one with a favorable outcome displayed an up-regulation of ifns and irf3 and a less pronounced increase of serum cxcl10 levels 91
in vitro studies also support the relevance of chemokines in mers-cov patients a 2013 study evaluated the expression of several chemokines and cytokines in cell lysates of polarized airway epithelial cells infected with mers-cov or sars-cov the results showed that cxcl8 was up-regulated to a greater extent by mers-cov infection as compared with sars-cov at difference ccl2 and cxcl10 were more strongly up-regulated by sars-cov than mers-cov 92 in addition in dendritic cells infected with mers-cov a significant down-regulation of ifn response paralleled by a striking elevation of cxcl10 was observed 93 a strong induction of cxcl10 secretion was observed also in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with mers-cov 9495 interesting data come also from an experimental mouse model of mers-cov infection in which a significant increase in cxcl8 expression was observed in lung and brain tissue after infection with mers-cov 96data regarding the relationship between covid-19 and chemokine dysregulation are still scanty but are increasingly being reported although preliminary the available data provided by both clinical and in vitro studies suggest possible similarities between what was observed after sars-cov and mers-cov infection overall an increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokines mainly cxcl10 and cxcl8 seems to characterize also covid-19 infectionthere are few in vitro studies regarding sars-cov-2 infection published so far the results of a study comparing sars-cov-2 and sars-cov viruses behavior in the lung tissue should be overviewed briefly the inoculation of the two viruses in ex vivo human lung tissue explants showed that sars-cov-2 was more capable as compared with sars-cov in both infecting and replicating in human lung furthermore sars-cov-2 infection was less able to trigger the expression of any ifns suggesting that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might differ in their ability to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as an example it could be worth highlighting that sars-cov infection upregulated 11 out of the 13 pro-inflammatory factors evaluated while sars-cov-2 upregulated only five of them namely cxcl10 il6 ccl2 cxcl1 cxcl5 interestingly cxcl8 transcription was up-regulated only by sars-cov but not sars-cov-2 infection while the opposite was observed for cxcl10 97the potential involvement of the chemokine system during sars-cov-2 infection was already evident from the first covid-19 series described by chinese physicians in early january 2020 it was reported that several pro-inflammatory cytochines and chemokines including cxcl10 cxcl8 ccl2 tnf and ifn were higher in the plasma of covid-19 patients as compared to healthy controls more importantly among infected patients cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf circulating concentrations but not those of ifn were found to be significantly higher in patients requiring admission to intensive care units as compared to patients experiencing a less severe clinical course 4chen et al recently characterized the immunological features of covid-19 patients with different severity of the disease briefly the 11 patients with severe disease displayed significantly higher serum levels of il-6 il-10 and tnf- and lower absolute numbers of t lymphocytes cd4  t cells and cd8  t cells as compared with the 10 patients with moderate disease of note severe cases were characterized by a lower expression of ifn- by cd4  t cells as compared with moderate cases 98xiong et al performed a transcriptome sequencing analysis of several pro-inflammatory genes in both pmcs and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of patients with covid-19 compared with samples form healthy donors the authors reported that covid-19 patients showed up-regulation of genes encoding for several immune-regulatory molecules in particular cxcl10 in pbmcs whereas no up-regulation of cxcl10 gene was observed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid moreover an up-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis and p53 signaling pathways in pbmc was observed leading to the hypothesis that this process could be the underlying cause of lymphopenia commonly observed in covid-19 patients 99 another study by wang et al including 65 sars-cov-2-positive patients showed that the absolute numbers of cd4  t cells cd8  t cells and b cells progressively decreased in relation with increasing severity of illness 100 in this view the findings recently reported by yang et al appear of potential clinical relevance indeed several cytokinechemokine levels were measured and found to be elevated in patients with different clinical severity of the covid-19 among them cxcl10 ccl7 and il-1 receptor antagonist were the ones significantly related to disease severity and even more importantly cxcl10 levels were the only one to be positively and significantly correlated with the viral load yang et al 2020sars-cov-2 and its related syndrome covid-19 have been known to the scientific community since less than 5 months clearly much is yet to be understood and the challenge for the next future will be to increase our understanding the physiopathology of this novel infectious disease hopefully the advances in our comprehension of the mechanisms sustaining the clinical course and patients-related factors driving the final outcome will be helpful in developing effective preventive strategies andor therapeutical options based on current knowledge the cytokine storm appears as one of the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening event related to covid-19 sustaining its major clinical consequences the immune mediated events related to the response to sars-cov-2 infection and the role of the chemokinechemokine receptor system will be further and more extensively characterized with the final goal to identify targeted therapeutic strategies although lessons from the previous sars and mers epidemics can be drawn there is still much to do in order to conclude whether sars-cov-2 virus behaves in the same way of its predecessors or if it is characterized by peculiar specificities clearly the hide-and-seek challenge between the virus and our immune defenses will also help us understanding the extremely variable spectrum of clinical manifestations of covid-19 which appears to range between asymptomatic cases to possibly lethal bilateral pneumonia with multi-organ failurenonethis paper was not supported by any grant or funding

editing mario rotondi conceptualization writing- reviewing and editing supervisionas of 28 april 2020 worldwide there were more than 29 million confirmed cases of covid-19 with a mortality of about 203000 in the usa there were more than 968000 confirmed cases of covid-19 and more than 54000 deaths 3 the complete clinical manifestation is not clear yet as the reported symptoms range from mild-to-severe and may result in the mortality just indicated 4 fever cough myalgia or fatigue pneumonia and complicated dyspnea are the most commonly reported symptoms headache diarrhea hemoptysis runny nose and phlegm-producing cough are less commonly reported 4 patients with mild symptoms were reported to recover after 1 week while severe cases were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus which may lead to death 4 cases resulting in death were primarily middle-aged and elderly patients with pre-existing diseases chronic respiratory disease cancer tumor surgery cirrhosis hypertension coronary heart disease diabetes and parkinsons disease 4 risk factors include being elderly having poor immune function having chronic co-morbidities long-term usage of immunosuppressive agents and having a prior history of surgery before admission 4 case definition guidelines mention the following symptoms fever decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotics treatment 4 our understanding of co-morbidities and risk factors is evolving as clinical data emerges a recent study in the journal of the american medical association considered the characteristics clinical presentation and outcomes of patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the usa and found that of 5700 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the new york city area the most common co-morbidities were hypertension obesity and diabetes among patients who were discharged or died n  2634 142 were treated in the intensive care unit 122 received invasive mechanical ventilation 32 were treated with kidney replacement therapy and 21 died 5additionally heart damage neurologic symptoms kidney damage and blood clots have been observed in covid-19 patients 6 one review found about 40 of seriously ill covid-19 patients in china experienced arrhythmias and 20 experienced other cardiac injuries a separate study of 416 hospitalized covid-19 patients in china found that 19 showed signs of heart damage and those patients were more likely to die 7 according to the study 51 of patients with heart damage died compared with 45 of patients who showed no signs of cardiac injury 7 a group of chinese doctors in another study published found that more than a third of 214 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan had neurologic symptoms the most common of which were dizziness headaches impaired consciousness loss of taste and smell and skeletal-muscle injuries 8 more serious but less commonly reported symptoms included seizures and stroke according to the study 8 the findings have prompted doctors to begin performing simple neurological exams on covid-19 patients 6 also early data showed 1430 of icu covid-19 patients in new york and wuhan lost kidney function and later required dialysis 6 similarly a study found that nine of 26 people who died of covid-19 in wuhan had acute kidney injuries and seven had units of the new coronavirus in their kidneys 9 the new coronavirus also appears to produce blood clots that can travel from patients veins to their lungs causing a pulmonary embolism and other organs 6 chinese researchers in one report said they found small blood clots in about 70 of the patients who died of covid-19 and were included in the study in comparison the researchers found similar blood clots in fewer than one in 100 patients who survived the disease 6 in a separate peer-reviewed study of 81 patients in wuhan researchers wrote that 20 patients experienced pulmonary embolism and eight died from the condition 10 clinicians and researchers have yet to determine whether the new coronavirus is directly attacking those organs or whether the injuries are caused by the patients immune responses to infection 6 additionally there is variation in recovery in patients and evidence of long-term persistence of the virus that may be etiology of lung inflammation and pneumonitis and instances of hypoxia patients may be predisposed to cancer as a result of the organ damage the virus is associated withas shown in figure 1 sars-cov-2 covs are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses with a nucleocapsid for addressing pathogenetic mechanisms of sars-cov-2 its viral structure and genome must be considered 2 in covs the genomic structure is organized in a ssrna of approximately 30 kb in length  the largest known rna viruses  and with a 5-cap structure and 3-poly-a tail figure 2 2 the virus goes from producing its rna to the creation of the of polyprotein 1a1ab pp1app1ab in the host 2 figure 3 shows how the viral replication-transcription complex is the product of the transcription apparatus which is housed in double-membrane vesicles formed from subgenomic rnas 2 open reading frames serve as templates for the production of the subgenomic mrnas in between these open reading frames transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences 2 at least six open reading frames are present including a frameshift able to block host innate immune response the viral envelope a structural protein confers viral pathogenicity since it promotes viral assembly and release however many of these features eg those of nonstructural protein 2 and 11 have not yet been described 2the spike glycoproteins of cov are composed of two subunits s1 and s2 the s2 protein is highly conserved and contains a fusion peptide a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain 2 the s subunits consists of homotrimers that compose the spikes on the viral surface which can transduce through host receptors thus it could be a target for antiviral anti-s2 compounds on the contrary the spike receptor-binding domain presents only a 40 amino acid identity with other sars-covs 2 other structural elements on which research must necessarily focus are the orf3b that has no homology with that of sars-covs and a secreted protein encoded by orf8 which is structurally different from those of sars-covmutations and strain recognitions can be determined from the sars-cov-2 gene sequences that were recently published a spike mutation which may have occurred in late 2019 triggered jumping to humans in particular sars-cov-2 gene sequence was compared with that of sars-cov they analyzed the transmembrane helical segments in the orf1ab encoded 2 nsp2 and nsp3 and found that position 723 presents a serine instead of a glycine residue while the position 1010 is occupied by proline instead of isoleucine 2 the matter of viral mutations is key for explaining potential disease relapsesthe current understanding of how a dysregulated immune response that causes lung immunopathology would lead to deleterious clinical manifestations after pathogenic hcov infections was reported in prior studies as early as 2017 channappanavar and perlman declared that recent identification of sars-like coronaviruses in bats and mers-cov in domesticated camels makes it likely that these viruses will continue to cross species barriers and cause additional outbreaks in human populations 11 these highly pathogenic hcovs cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans with a large fraction of patients developing short period of moderate clinical illness and a small but a substantial number of patients experiencing severe disease characterized by acute lung inflammation and acute respiratory disease 11there are certain inflammatory responses that may be conducive to cancer ifn- or inflammatory monocyte-macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines sensitized t cells to undergo apoptosis further impeding virus clearance 11 the loss of tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing ifn- trif an adapter molecule for tlr-3 and tlr-4 signaling resulted in a distinct inflammatory signature characterized by neutrophil and other inflammatory cell infiltration 11 a dysregulated immune response to sars-cov in trif-deficient mice was associated with aberrant antiviral ifn ifn- and ifn- pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine il-6 tnf ifn- and monocyte chemoattractant ccl5 and interferon-stimulated gene rsad2 ifit1 and cxcl10 responses another possible indicator of cancer risk 11multiple structural and nonstructural proteins of sars-cov antagonize interferon responses 5 very early after infection hcov reach high titers and sequester multiple proteins that inhibit the interferon response suggesting that immune response delay or evasion may be the result of early antagonism of the interferon 11 a dysfunctionally regulated inflammatory response and t-cell apoptotic sensitization is also further orchestrated by the delayed interferon signaling 11some consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage suboptimal t-cell response in other words cov-specific t cells are crucial for virus clearance and limit further damage to the host additionally t-cell responses also dampen overactive innate immune responses 11 exuberant inflammatory responses caused by pathogenic hcov diminish the t-cell response in the case of sars cov infection via tnf-mediated t-cell apoptosis thus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory response accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages and altered tissue homeostasis and acute respiratory distress syndrome 11figure 4 demonstrates the enormous immune response against the novel coronavirus 12 the innate immune response and adaptive immunity have distinct responses to coronaviruses infection 12 the sars-cov-2 cov infects macrophages and then macrophages present cov antigens to t cells and this process leads to t-cell activation and differentiation including the production of cytokines associated with the different t-cell subsets ie t helper cells followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification 12 the continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on natural killer cells and cd8 t-cell activation and cd8 t cells produce very effective mediators to clear cov 6the attachment of cov to dpp4r on the host cell through s protein leads to the appearance of genomic rna in the cytoplasm an immune response to dsrna that results can be partially generated during cov replication tlr-3 sensitized by dsrna leads to cascades of signaling pathways irfs and nf-b activation respectively which are activated to produce type i interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines 12 the production of type i interferons is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells sometimes accessory proteins of cov can interfere with tlr-3 signaling and bind the dsrna of cov during replication to prevent tlr-3 activation and evade the immune response 12tlr-4 might recognize s protein and lead to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the myd88-dependent signaling pathway viruscell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators 6 the secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 is promoted in infected cells in response to cov infection these chemokines and cytokines in turn recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection 12the host innate immune system detects viral infections by using prrs to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps at present the known prrs mainly include tlr rig-i-like receptor nod-like receptor c-type lectin-like receptors and free-molecule receptors in the cytoplasm such as cgas ifi16 sting and dai 12pamps recognized by tlrs include lipids lipoproteins proteins and nucleic acids of the bacterial viral parasite and fungal origins 12 the recognition of pamps by tlrs also occurs in cell membranes endosomes lysosomes and endocyte-lysosomes and other locations in cells 12 different tlrs can induce different biological responses via subsequent activation of varied adapter proteins such as myd88 tirap trip and tram but these adapter proteins all share the tir structure 12viral infection plays a key role in signaling factor activation that may have relevance for the initiation of cancer myd88 is the first identified tir family member which acts as an adapter protein it mainly activates the transcription factors nf-b and mapks pathways to induce inflammatory factors expression 12 additionally after a tlr is activated by the corresponding pamp myd88 recruits the receptor-related kinases irak4 iraki irak2 and irak-m irak4 plays an important role in activating nf-b and mapks downstream of myd88 irak interacts with traf6 which causes its k-63 ubiquitination and facilitates nemo ubiquitination to activate nf-b which may have implications for aberrant cell growth trif-dependent pathways activate irf3 and nf-b the function of tram and tirap is to recruit trif molecules to the tlr4 receptor and myd88 to the tlr2 and tlr4 receptors promoting cellular growth 12other signaling pathways are activated depletion of cd4 t cells is associated with reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes and neutralizing antibody and cytokine production resulting in a strong immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of sars-cov from lungs 12 additionally t helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines via the nf-b signaling pathway il-17 cytokines recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection with inflammation and activate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades such as il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 12there may be a distinct association between novel coronavirus infection and the onset of cancer through the activation of the mapk and jakstat signaling pathways and the nf-b transcription factor the mapk signaling pathway activated upon covid-19 infection is involved in the tumorigenesis of a number of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma adrenocortical cancer endometrial cancer colorectal cancer and pituitary adenomas the rasmapk pathway is activated in 50100 of human hepatocellular carcinomas and is correlated with a poor prognosis 13 the mapk signaling pathway is also implicated in pituitary adenomas and because of the important roles of mapk signaling pathways in tumorigenesis the use of the mapk signaling pathways as therapeutic targets has continuously been considered as a promising strategy for pituitary adenoma therapy 14 in the context of the role of two of the mapk signaling pathways erks 12 and p38 data suggest that mek-mapk-erk signaling has a role in adrenocortical tumorigenesis that could be potentially used as a diagnostic marker for malignancy and targeted treatment in adrenocortical carcinoma 15 cholesterol in the form of ldl enhances intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer progression via activation of reactive oxygen species ros and signaling pathways including the mapk pathway 16 and the estrogen receptor- activates mapk signaling pathway to promote the development of endometrial cancer 17 the oncologic sequelae of covid-19 may include these cancers upon viral activation of the mapk signaling pathway these tumorigenic pathways may play a role in cancer initiation and progression in covid-19 infectionthe jakstat signaling pathway is also activated by type i interferon synthesis promoted by irf3 and irf7 activation this has been through prrs that recognize viral rna the activation jakstat signaling pathway has shown to be involved in tumorigenesis including t-cell lymphoma lung cancer and breast cancer gene expression profiling has implicated several intracellular signaling cascades including the jakstat pathway in the pathogenesis of particular subtypes of lymphoma 18 jakstat signaling pathways are mutationally activated in many extranodal t-cell lymphomas such as natural killert-cell and hepatosplenic t-cell lymphomas 19 since the jakstat pathway is considered to be a central player in inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis the implication of jakstat signaling and the therapeutic potential of jak12 inhibition was investigated in k-ras-driven lung adenocarcinoma and data showed that jak1 and jak2 are activated in human lung adenocarcinoma and that increased activation of jakstat signaling correlated with disease progression and k-ras activity in human lung adenocarcinoma 20 dysregulated jakstat signaling has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis which is associated with high relapse risks which may be mediated through gram1b 21nf-b and trif-dependent pathways are also activated and irf3 and ifn- are activated in turn 12 transcription factors irf3 and nf-b induce the gene expression of type i interferon through their activation by adaptor protein trif of tlrs tlrs classify these types of signaling pathways induced by viral infection the tlr signaling pathways are classified as the myd88-dependent pathway which functions to activate immune inflammatory factors and the trif-dependent pathway which then in turn functions to activate the type i interferons and inflammatory factors 12 nf-b-driven gene products include cytokineschemokines growth factors anti-apoptotic factors angiogenesis regulators and metalloproteinases and drive oncogenesis for instance many of the genes transcribed by nf-b promote gastric carcinogenesis since it has been shown that chemotherapy-caused cellular stress could elicit activation of the survival factor nf-b which leads to acquisition of chemoresistance the nf-b system is recommended for therapeutic targeting 22 prosaposin a neurotrophic factor promotes the proliferation and tumorigenesis of glioma through tlr4-mediated nf-b signaling pathways 23dendritic cells dcs also respond to the virus and their differentiation from precursor cells to mature cells may be inhibited as is the case with hiv-1 if their maturation is blocked by perhaps the lack of gm-csf il-4 and tnf- the adaptive immune response which plays a key role in the cancer-immunity cycle may be inhibited figure 5 dcs are the major antigen-presenting cells in the organism and contribute both types of immunity by activating t cells and b cells immature dcs have strong migration ability and mature dcs can effectively activate t cells in the central link of start-up regulation and maintenance of immune responses 6 thus if the maturation process of dcs is blocked it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune responses that may need to be mobilized in attacking cancerother types of viruses have ostensible effects on adaptive immunity in the case of hiv-1 dc precursor cells cannot differentiate into dcs if transfected with hiv-1 nef protein in the presence of the inducers indicating that nef blocks the differentiation of dc precursor cells into mature dcs 12 additionally both the core protein and ns3 protein of hcv inhibits the expression of cd1a cd1b and dc-sign molecules on human peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells which play an important role in the development of peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells to dcs 12 in addition hiv-1 attenuates the mhc i on the surface of dcs thereby reducing the ability of dcs to present the viral antigens hiv-1 infection enhances the expression of dc-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrity dc-sign thus inhibiting cc chemokine receptor 7 and mhc-ii which are important receptors of dc homing 12 these results indicate that virus infection interferes with the differentiation and function of dcs hinders the subsequent adaptive immune response mediated by dcs and makes the virus evade the adaptive immune response of the host successfully 6 if these dc events are occurring cancer may co-opt normal cellular function and evade immune responses in a viral infection such as covid-19a cytokine storm an excessive immune reaction in the host also results from viral mechanisms that results in extensive tissue damage mediated by il-produced by activated leukocytes b lymphocyte differentiation cell growth stimulation and pathogenesis of some types for cancer may result these effects are linked to the function of structural and nonstructural proteins of the virus 2 cytokine release syndrome an immune-related adverse effect of chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapies is also implicated in the potential emergence of cancer additionally as tissue damage envelopes the bodys physiological functioning and cellular resources are increasingly devoted to compensating for it cancer may emerge as a risk factor lung tissue damage a prevalent and major consequence of infection may be particularly at risk for developing into lung cancer and patients who experience these symptoms may need to be monitored for these sequelaein the cancer-immunity cycle figure 5 the cancer presents antigens which antigen-presenting cells present to mhc to activate cytotoxic cd8 t cells to ultimately destroy cancer cells in a cyclic process 24 in cancer the cancer-immunity cycle is dysfunctional with the accumulation of inhibitors of t-cell response and promoters of cancer cell growth in sars-cov infection cytotoxic t cells play a significant role and combat the pathogen by killing viral-infected cells and promoting the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating t-dependent b cells the inflammation observed in the pulmonary environment upon viral infection is due to this large role played by cd8 t cells which lead to immune injury immunosuppression a risk factor for novel coronavirus may emerge conversely as a risk for cancer in the context of viral infectionfrom an understanding of the cancer-immunity cycle are there are any elements of novel coronavirus infection that would make the cycle vulnerable to cancer at any point and prevent the generation of immunity to cancer the presence of checkpoint inhibitors to immune responses such as cytotoxic t-lymphocyte associated protein-4 programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand-1 may inure the development of cancer with viral infection in a depleted t-cell environment postinfection the broad t-cell response to cancer may be undermined this inflammatory response concomitant with immune cell depletion whether temporary or not may lead to oncologic sequelae if accompanied by a superimposed mutagenic andor carcinogenic event potentially occurring in a time-adjacent manner figure 6 displays the tumor microenvironment in the context of breast cancer and illustrates major inflammation and cytokine release marks of viral infection which may predispose to cancerthe implications for novel coronavirus infection on genomic variability are unknown at this point if the virus through its replicative 26 and recombination capabilities 27 leads to genetic alterations that may predispose to cancer another risk factor may be revealedthe administration of antiviral agents and other proposed treatments such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine may induce drug resistance to cancer therapies such as targeted agents and immunotherapies even further the status of targeted therapies may be jeopardized by the infection of the virus since many personalized agents target growth factors that are possibly affected by viral transduction however this remains to be investigatedit is generally known that viruses can cause cancer by integration of the genomes into host cell chromosomes and the expression of oncoproteins while both of these mechanisms are not implicated in sars-cov-2 these are not exclusive mechanisms the turning on of oncogenic signaling pathways and the acute inflammatory response that results upon coronavirus infection can be hypothesized as being cancer inducing or leading to the risk of developing cancer especially if the patient has a superimposed mutagenic or carcinogenic event occurring concomitantly even if the virus does not cause a chronic infection like viruses such as hcv hcv and ebv additionally there exist limited resources and research as a result of the pandemic that may damage the prognosis of cancer patients novel coronavirus can destroy t cells but unlike hiv does not lead to persistent infection of t cells data suggest however that there is a general depletion of t cells in the covid-19 infection environment and this may affect the healthy progression of the cancer-immunity cycle also there exist gaps in current knowledge on the novel coronavirus impact on the immune system during co-infection by other viruses such as hcv hiv and ebv finally the overwhelming organ dysfunction that novel coronaviruses results in some cases should be further investigated and as possibly having an association with cancer these should remain areas of research for future studyas the population infected with the novel coronavirus grows and the infection spreads its clinical sequelae may pose an issue of concern for physicians and oncologists in particular future studies should focus on the predisposition of these recovering patients for cancer and if these patients need to be monitored for the disease it is the cumulative effect of many distinguishable aspects of coronavirus infection that leads to the increased predisposition to cancer which then warrants closer follow-up in the future the organ damage inflammatory response and signaling pathways activation that occur upon viral infection may sum to significantly increase patients predisposition to cancer and this may be compounded by a superimposed mutagenic or carcinogenic event the oncology field may evolve by investigating the potential tumor microenvironment in the context of sars-cov-2 infection and if the virus can be considered an etiological agent in the development of cancer clinical sequelae may involve physicians needing to refer covid-19 cases to oncologists for the confirmation of cancer either benign and malignant cases the caveat must be mentioned however that knowledge surrounding coronavirus is constantly being updated and this review must be interpreted in light of any recently updated knowledgesevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 recently emerged in wuhan hubei-china as responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and then spread rapidly worldwide it was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 1 2while most individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms up to 1520 require hospitalization and less than 5 develop a critical illness characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple-organ failure mof that usually need intensive-care support and often yield a poor prognosis 3 in most cases patients presenting to the emergency room have not undergone prehospital ambulatory testing or as a consequence any ongoing treatment intended to reduce the severity of disease 4 5 the pathophysiology of covid-19 is far from being completely understood and the lack of effective treatments has led to a sense of urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies based on pathophysiological assumptions the sars-cov2 spike protein initiates cellular infection by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme ace-2 on human cells 6 cellular infection and viral replication cause activation of the inflammasome in the host cell leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and cell death by pyroptosis with ensuing release of a damage-associated molecular pattern further amplifying the inflammatory response 7 8 9 the exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection a condition known as cytokine release syndrome crs fig 1 or cytokine storm is emerging as one of the mechanisms leading to ards and mof in covid-19 7 in line with this recent studies have shown that patients with covid-19 have high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-1 il-2 il-6 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 il-18 tumor necrosis factor tnf- granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor fibroblast growth factor macrophage inflammatory protein 1 compared to healthy individuals 10 circulating levels of il-6 il-10 and tnf- also correlated with illness severity as they were significantly higher in intensive care unit icu patients compared to mildmoderate cases in particular il-6 may suppress normal t-cell activation 11 and tnf- can promote t-cell apoptosis via interacting with its receptor tnf receptor 1 12 and their upregulation may in part contribute to lymphocytopenia a feature often encountered in covid-19 with a more pronounced decline in severe cases 13 as such a recent study found that in icu patients due to covid-19 tnf- and il-6 concentrations negatively correlated with total t-cell cd4 and cd8 counts 14 furthermore ace-2 consumption by viral entry interrupts angiotensin ii angii metabolism resulting in an initial increase in local angii concentrations that may enhance proinflammatory cytokine release and foster diffuse microvascular dysfunction and a prothrombotic milieu 15 16antiviral treatment may play a role in the management of covid-19 but especially in more severe forms immunomodulatory treatments blunting cytokine release may turn out to be beneficial if appropriately timedthe objective of this article is to explore and comment on the potential role of the promising immunomodulatory therapies using pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to overcome the dysregulated proinflammatory response in covid-19 fig 1despite being extensively used empirically in the treatment of severe forms of ards the role of systemic corticosteroids cs remains controversial 17 cs are the cornerstone of treatments for cytokine storms and macrophage activation syndrome in autoimmuneautoinflammatory diseases 18 in the covid-19 scenario they may be useful in the more severe forms of crs to curb the systemic inflammatory response and prevent the occurrence of ards if appropriately timed 10 19 20 on the other hand the early use of cs seems to be outweighed by their adverse effects such as impaired virus clearance and an increased rate of secondary bacterial or fungal infections 21 in fact a recent systematic review and meta-analysis in adult patients with influenza pneumonia demonstrated that cs increase not only mortality but also the rate of secondary infections and prolong the icu length of stay 22 for these reasons the who does not recommend routine administration of cs in covid-19 patients outside of clinical trials their adjunctive use may be indicated on an individual basis or unless indicated for other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma and septic shock 23the antimalaria drugs chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq have been proven to interfere with the viral entry process through alteration of ph-dependent endosome-mediated viral endocytosis and could inhibit sars-cov entry through change of the glycosylation of the ace2 receptor and spike protein hcq is less toxic than cq and can be used for long periods of time 24 moreover both cq and hcq have been proven to have immunomodulatory activities by interfering with toll-like receptor signaling pathways reducing cytokine production and inhibiting mhc class ii expression antigen presentation and immune activation through the reduction of cd154 expression in t cells 25 26 27 the ability of cqhcq to inhibit certain coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 has led to inclusion of the use of cqhcq for the treatment of covid-19 high-quality studies are however urgently needed to provide information on its effectiveness address the optimal dose and duration of treatment and explore its side effects and long-term outcomes since the earliest phases of the pandemic cq and hcq have been empirically used alone or in combination with macrolides for the treatment of covid-19 with the intent of reducing hospitalizations and deaths although several multicenter randomized controlled trials are underway a recently published large observational multinational registry showed a decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with covid-19 requiring hospitalization treated with cqhcq alone or in combination with a macrolide however these data do not apply to the use of cqhcq in the ambulatory and outpatient settings and due to the observational study design the possibility of unmeasured confounding biases cannot be excluded on the basis of this study at present the use of cq and hcq is not recommended in hospitalized patients other than in the context of randomized trialsanakinra an il-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the biologic activity of il-1 is a promising agent in this setting since it has already been shown to be effective in severe sepsis complicated by crs macrophage activation syndrome 29 30 recently monteagudo et al 31 reported 5 cases of a cytokine storm 2 with an identified viral trigger in which continuous intravenous anakinra infusion resulted in prompt improvement in laboratory and clinical parameters there are limited data with specific il-1 blockers in patients with covid-19 cavalli et al 32 reported on 29 patients with covid-19 and ards managed with noninvasive ventilation outside of the icu treated with high-dose anakinra the treatment was shown to be safe and it was associated with clinical improvement in 72 of the patients 32 in a recently published cohort study by huet et al 33 including 52 patients in the anakinra group who were prospectively enrolled and 44 patients in the control group who were retrospectively selected subcutaneous anakinra 100 mg twice a day for 72 h and then 100 mg daily for 7 days reduced both the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in the icu and mortality among patients with severe forms of covid-19 without serious side effects 33 obviously despite the promising results of these studies controlled trials are required in order to obtain confirmation of efficacy swedish orphan biovitrum the manufacturer of anakinra announced upcoming trials of anakinra in covid-19 in a recent press release 34 a small retrospective analysis of 10 patients treated with canakinumab an il-1 antibody novartis 10 patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation showed rapid improvement of the inflammatory response and resolution of the hypoxemia 35 supporting the central role of il-1 and the inflammasome in covid-19 a phase 3 clinical trial with canakinumab in severe covid-19 disease is ongoing nct04362813anti-il-6 agents are a class of drugs with anti-inflammatory properties that act by targeting either the il6 receptor or il-6 itself studies have shown that tocilizumab an il-6 receptor antibody could reverse crs in the setting of chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapy for cancer 36 because of the greatly elevated serum levels of il-6 in patients with covid-19 3 its off-label used in the early stage of the diseases suggests a favorable impact on the course of covid-19 37 moreover in 2 small retrospective studies of covid-19 patients in china suffering from severe lung injury it was observed that the use of this agent could provide significant clinical improvement without important side effects 38 39 a press release from a network of hospitals in france announced that the corimuno-toci nct04331808 trial of tocilizumab versus placebo in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia not requiring mechanical ventilation met the primary endpoint of reduction in the proportion of deaths or the need for mechanical ventilation at 14 days 40another ongoing clinical trial nct04327388 aims to assess the efficacy of sarilumab another il-6 receptor inhibitor in adult patients hospitalized with severe or critical covid-19 a press release from regeneron announced the results of the phase 2 study and the decision to proceed with enrollment in phase 3 only in patients defined as critical ie those requiring high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation the press release showed encouraging data for sarilumab 400 mg versus placebo in the reduction of death or the need for ventilator on day 29 with intermediate results for the 200-mg arm hence the decision to continue with only the 400-mg arm in phase 3 41furthermore an ongoing clinical trial nct04380961 is evaluating the response to sirukumab an antibody targeting il-6 administered as a single intravenous dose compared to placebo in severe or critical covid-19 on top of standard of carea clinical trial nct04330638 is also testing whether combined il-1 and il-6 blockade using anakinra tocilizumab and siltuximab another antibody that binds to il-6 alone or in different combinations may produce additional clinical benefits in terms of death days hospitalized icu days etc compared to standard-of-care or single anticytokine therapytocilizumab is now already included in many practice guidelines for covid-19 management especially for the treatment of critically ill patients with severe refractory hypoxemia in a later stage after the high-viral-load initial phase all over the world while we wait for more definite data from multiple ongoing clinical trials 42the viral spike protein of sars-cov2 seems to induce a tnf--converting enzyme tace-dependent alteration of ace-2 which allows virus penetration into host cells and the more tnf- levels are increased the more this pathway is facilitated 43 tnf antagonism in high cytokine states is a relatively unexplored field with a case report suggesting a potential benefit in macrophage activation syndrome caused by herpes virus simplex infection 44 a clinical trial evaluating the effects of the tnf- blocker adalimumab in covid-19 infection is currently ongoing chictr2000030089the janus kinase jak family and in particular the adaptor-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 plays a role in viral particles endocytosis aak1 inhibitors have been suggested as possible candidates for the treatment of covid-19 barcitinib a jak inhibitor with a high affinity for aak1-binding has been the first to be considered due to its relative safety 45 however there is the risk that jak inhibitors could affect the activity of a variety of inflammatory cytokines including inf- a potent mediator of the antiviral response at present there are 2 clinical trials chictr2000030170 and chictr2000029580 the results of which will hopefully provide further insights into jak and aak1 inhibition effects in covid-19 patientsc-c chemokine receptor type 5 ccr5 is expressed on the surface of white blood cells especially t-cd4 cells and mediates macrophage migration into areas of inflammation favoring the release of inflammatory cytokines and amplification of the immune response 46 a phase 2 trial is currently evaluating leronlimab a humanized monoclonal antibody inhibiting ccr5 which is already under study in hiv infection 46 to determine whether blockage of this pathway is able to reduce mortality at 28 days in severe forms of covid-19 nct04347239mesenchymal stem cells msc possess potent immunomodulatory activities 47 several in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have proven that msc can prevent lung injury reduce inflammation regulate immune responses and foster alveolar fluid clearance 47 moreover msc secrete antimicrobial and painkiller molecules 47 the in vivo safety of in vivo local and intravenous administration of msc has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials including studies of ards 47 on the basis of these positive results msc use has been proposed to treat lung injury due to covid-19 and a recent pilot trial by leng et al 48 including 7 patients showed that intravenous transplantation of ace-2 msc is safe and effective for the treatment of sars-cov2-related pneumonia especially in patients in critically severe condition at present there are several ongoing clinical trials testing the application of mesenchymal stromal stem cells sc nct04361942 and nct04345601 adipose-tissue-derived sc nct04366323 human dental pulp sc nct04336254 and bone marrow-derived sc in covid-19 patients which hopefully will provide further insight into the potential beneficialharmful roles of mscintravenous immunoglobulin ivig has already been proven to be beneficial in patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases 49 50 a new perspective is the use of ivig-containing polyclonal immunoglobulin g igg isolated and pooled from healthy donors to provide short- and medium-term therapies to covid-19 patients 51 ivig may exert many anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects which could accelerate virus clearance and prevent entry into target cells in a small chinese case series from jin yintan hospital wuhan china a high dose of ivig administered within the first few days of clinical deterioration proved to be a valuable option to block covid-19 cascade progression thus obtaining significant improvements in terms of clinical outcomes and recovery rates the timing however was found to be crucial as no beneficial effects were observed if lung injury and systemic damage had already occurred 52 despite it being promising ivig use in covid-19 requires evaluation in dedicated prospective and randomized clinical trialsconvalescent plasma therapy cpt is based on the transfusion of plasma collected from patients who have recovered from sars-cov2 infection and developed antibodies to susceptible individuals in order to confer them immediate immunity plasma from healthy donors provides neutralizing antibodies limiting viral amplification and immunomodulatory effects via the infusion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies that block complement inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies 53 cpt has already been proven to be beneficial both as postexposure prophylaxis andor treatment for different infectious diseases including in the context of sars-1 and mers outbreaks 54 recently in a case series of 5 critically ill patients with covid-19-related ards convalescent plasma transfusion with a sars-cov-2-specific antibody igg 52 led to improvement in patients clinical status moreover a systematic review by rajendran et al 55 including 5 studies on the use of cpt in covid-19 individuals showed that this therapy may reduce mortality in critically ill patients increase neutralizing antibody titers allow the disappearance of sars-cov-2 rna in a large number patients and lead to significant symptom relief of note the cpt benefit is greater when it is used in a timely manner in the early viremic phase as its prevalent action is through direct neutralization of the virus whereas the use of ivig administration may be useful even in a more tardive phase as its principal mechanism is to counteract the deleterious effects of the dysregulated immune response on the basis of these encouraging results there are several ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of cpt in covid-19 patients and their results may provide further insights into the proper timing and modality of use of this promising therapya nonpharmacological option for covid-19 to counteract the dysregulated proinflammatory response could be represented by blood purification techniques 56 57 nevertheless the application of these techniques in covid-19 patients is still not widespread and further investigation is needed to confirm their beneficial effectstherapeutic plasma exchange is an extracorporeal treatment performed by filtrating a volume of plasma equivalent to the estimated plasma volume that selectively removes circulating pathogenetic substances such as auto-reactive antibodies immune complexes paraproteins lipoproteins and inammatory mediators like cytokines therapeutic plasma exchange was proven to be effective as rescue therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm in a small case series of patients suffering from ph1n1 inuenza a-associated respiratory failure and hemodynamic shock reducing the need for vasopressors and improving the pao2fio2 ratio 58hemadsorption is performed using dedicated blood adsorber devices with a highly porous biocompatible polymer able to bind hydrophobic compounds with a molecular weight between 10 and 55 kda a range where most cytokines reside in europe cytosorb cartridges cytosorbents corporation usa are among the most diffused extracorporeal therapies with the aim of obtaining cytokine blood purification and it has been proven to be beneficial in controlling the dysregulated inflammatory response in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or are critically ill 59 in a case series of septic patients requiring renal replacement therapy an adjunctive hemoadsorption strategy resulted in rapid hemodynamic stabilization and a sensible decrease in blood lactate with a reduction of the mortality rate compared to the mortality rate predicted by acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii score especially when started within 24 h of a sepsis diagnosis 60 this approach provides a nonspecific cytokine removal thus leading to the assumption that the possible underlying mechanism explaining its efficacy lies in the fact that cytokines that are more concentrated and therefore more likely to be harmful are eliminated to a greater extent 59 moreover according to the cytogenetic model clearance of circulating cytokines could allow redirection of the host immune response to the source or sites of inflammation 61 nevertheless at present cytokine hemoadsorption therapy is not a standardized strategy and there is still a lack of control trials proving its real effectiveness in clinical outcome improvement and short- and long-term survival in humans further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of action indications and clinical benefits of this therapy 19 62 however in the absence of resolutive options for covid-19 treatment the use of hemoadsorption therapies in critical cases has recently been proposed as it could help to contain the inflammatory response responsible for crs in these patientsanother adjunctive potential of extracorporeal therapy includes plasmapheresis using high-affinity matrixes of lectin for coronavirus trapping thus leading to a viremia reduction 63in patients who fail other treatments extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo remains the last resource 64 an ongoing trial nct04324528 is currently testing whether veno-venous vv ecmo in combination with a cytokine adsorption cytosorb adsorber device versus vv-ecmo alone may blunt inflammation parameters and improve patient survival in those with severe covid-19 infectionrecently a small case series of covid-19 patients treated with blood purification therapies showed a reduction of inflammatory markers and 2 out of 3 patients survived with no early complications 65 nevertheless the high cost and relatively low availability represent a significant limitation for the use of this option for a pandemic viral disease highlighting the need to accurately select the target patientsin the covid-19 pandemic the timing and patient selection will be crucial issues to handle limited and often expensive resources and an integrated multimodality approach of clinical laboratory and imaging parameters may help to guide the management of these patients identification of patients with a hyperinflammatory response through cytokine profiling could direct the choice of a specific anticytokine drug or even combinedsequential regimens if these prove ineffective in improving the clinical status implementation of broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory therapies such as ivig and blood purification could be considered however before starting therapeutic regimens including immunosuppressive drugs it is of paramount importance to take into account the risk of previous viral infection ie hbv hcv ebv and vzv tuberculosis and histoplamosis reactivation and accordingly to consider concomitant antiviralantifungal prophylaxisin the quest for more effective covid-19 therapeutic strategies accumulating evidence suggests the role of immune system dysregulation leading to an inappropriate crs in the pathogenesis of progressive hypoxia in patients with covid-19 while the initial results with immune modulators are promising the results of ongoing clinical trials will clarify the efficacy safety and role of the different treatments according to

declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11th at present in may 2020 there are more than 3000000 infected people around the world of all infected only a small percentage induces critical state considering the presence of any comorbidity or condition which can be diabetes hypertension obesity asthma pregnancy lung diseases liver diseases oral dysbiosis aging and gender 12 15 16this work proposes to evaluate if pd could be a risk factor for developing severe of covid -19 illness because of shared risk factorshypothesispd could be associated with severe covid-19 illness oral medical history of pd could be a characteristic to identify a risk group to severe covid-19 the suggested relationship between pd and severe covid-19 illness could be connected to closely shared risk factors among these affections most comorbidities and risk factors reported in patients with severe covid-19 also aggravate the development of pd until now information on oral health history including periodontal status in patients with severe covid-19 illness has not been reported
agingaging is considered a process that causes degenerative changes at the cellular level and sometimes leads to various diseases that can be autoimmune infectious or inflammatory including pd 17 18 according to the who pd affects elderly adults who are among the main target groups because it is common that they have the following additional risk factors poor oral hygiene habits presence of chronic diseases use of medications smoking or lack of timely dental treatment which can alter gingival microbiota and allow the development of pd and even respiratory infections 19 20 21people over 65 years are the highest risk group by severe covid-19 illness mainly for the multimorbidity which is a common factor in this group that allows the rapid attack of the virus and increase mortality 22 another critical factor for the disease to be severe is the immune response which is not as strong compared to young people 18therefore it is clear that aging is a determining risk factor in linking pd and severe covid-19 since they share the associated risk factors that can lead to complications thus allows to identify risk groups to severe covid-19genderdifferent studies have suggested that men are more prone to severe forms of pd than women 23 24 25 26 it was proposed that differences in immune function could be involved moreover probably behavioral and environmental factors could have an important role to explain differences in gender however this has not been well determined 26in similar way it was suggested that men are more prone to become seriously ill by covid-19 than women 27 28 29 recently it was proposed that differences of immune response to sars-cov-2 between men and women could explain this variance 28 thus pd could show the risk of covid-19 illness considering its association with gender and possible immunologic factorsdiabetes mellitusdiabetes mellitus dm is a chronic disease determined by loss of control of glucose homeostasis that can affect the organs of the body who this disease is associated in a bilateral way with pd that is the pd can be a complication of diabetes by out of control the level of glycemia and having diabetes increases the possibility of developing pd 30 31 32 the proposed mechanisms to understanding this association include alterations in vascular cellular and host repair processes 33increasing evidence supports an association between severe covid-19 and dm this is supported by chest tomography and other clinical parameters that state alterations in patients with diabetes 34 35 several studies show patients with severe covid-19 may have affected expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 in the lungs this receptor is greater in diabetic than in no diabetic patients due to treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers arbs 36 37 in both periodontal disease and covid-19 the response immune is affected by host factors external and internal 37 38diabetes is a significant predictor of severe covid-19 and periodontal disease so that the latter could be useful to identify risk groups of covid-19hypertension and cardiovascular diseasehypertension is a health disorder that affects a large part of the population worldwide high blood pressure bp is considered the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease cvd 39 epidemiological studies have shown an association between hypertension cvd and pd 40 the latter is currently considered a risk factor in hypertension and cvd 41 42 43in pd the accumulation of various bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm induces a chronic inflammatory response by inducing the production of cytokines il-1 il-6 il-8 and tnf-a 44 which regulate and increase levels of c-reactive protein crp detection of high-density crp has been considered a marker in cvd and hypertension in pd presence of crp is the link between these diseases 41 45 46hypertension is among the main comorbidities in covid-19 infection 47 treatment of hypertension with arbs increases expression of ace-2 48 another study in ep showed that the activity of ace and ace-2 was increased in this disease 49 hao xu analyzed seqrna profile data and demonstrated that ace-2 could be expressed in oral mucosal epithelial cells 50 therefore the expression of ace-2 in hypertension and periodontitis may represent a major risk factor for severe covid-19obesityin industrialized countries about 50 of the population is overweight or obese with prevalence increasing annually after smoking obesity is the highest risk factor to develop pd and its relationship has been studied since 1977 by perslein and bissada studying obese rats 51 52 different mechanisms linking pd and obesity have been suggested obesity can alter the periodontal microbial composition and is associated with an increase in periodontal pathogens 53 the main consequence of obesity is a systemic inflammation state 51 adipose tissue typically secretes low levels of proinflammatory cytokines il-6 il-8 tnf- adipokines like leptin and adiponectin 54 these cytokines may contribute to the development of pd altering the response to bacteria in gingival tissue 53 additionally the production of reactive oxygen species that generate oxidative stress is increased in obesity 55 this is important since oxidative stress is increased in pd and it could contribute to its progression 56 if pd is established in individuals with obesity there is an induction of an increased inflammatory systemic state triggered by the dissemination of bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines 53obesity and their complications increase the risk to develop severe covid-19 illness 57 58 59 factors implicated in this association could be decreased expiratory reserve volume functional capacity and respiratory system compliance additionally augmented inflammatory factors reported in obesity could contribute to amplify the response of the patient and develop severe covid-19 58 59pd could contribute to the amplification of a systemic inflammatory response by dissemination of bacterial products and as a source of inflammatory cytokines in patients with covid-19 therefore aggravating the disease moreover it is possible that individuals with obesity and pd have an increased risk of developing severe covid-19pregnancypregnancy allows various physiological changes 60 and suppresses the mothers immune system to allow gestational development over the last few years some epidemiological studies have suggested the vulnerability of pregnant women to pd due to an affected inflammatory response 61 62 furthermore it has been established that increased progesterone levels trigger the gingival response causing dysbiosis in this way high periodontopathogens growth occurs 63 64 causing clinical manifestations in the supporting and protective tissues of the teeth although the link between pd and pregnancy is controversial some risk has been suggested among pregnant women and pd as they may have complications during pregnancy 65 or premature deliveryas long as the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is spreading worldwide some cases of covid-19 have confirmed in pregnant women although immunosuppression high progesterone and estrogen levels and the physiological adaptive changes predispose pregnant women to respiratory infections diseases 66 67 less than 10 developed severe covid-19 disease 68 69 70 however this infection could complicate perinatal events such as preeclampsia premature rupture of the membrane low birth weight even death 67 71 vertical transmission cases of covid-19 are not fully confirmed 66 67despite the fact that the association between pregnancy and pd is not clear coinfection of sars-cov-2 in pregnant women with pd and other comorbidities could complicate pregnancieschronic obstructive pulmonary disease copdcopd is a chronic inflammatory lung disease caused by important exposure to noxious particles or gases being smoking a main risk factor in developed countries 72 different studies have associated copd and pd 73 74 75 however this link could be confounding by different factors like age or smoking recently it was suggested that the severity of pd increases the risk for copd mortality in older patients 75 though causality or involved molecular mechanisms have not been reportedit was suggested that patients with covid-19 have an increased risk of aggravation when they present copd 76 and patients with pre-existing copd have a 4-fold increased risk to develop severe covid-19 illness 77 it was proposed that the increased risk could partly be because copd patients present increased expression of ace-2 in airways 78 thus the association of pd with copd could be helpful to identify risk groups to develop severe covid-19 since copd increased importantly the risk of this affectionsmokingsmoking is a major risk factor to develop pd and it affects the progression severity and response to treatments of this condition different molecular mechanisms have been suggested to explain the contribution of smoking to progression of pd smoking promotes dysbiosis in periodontal tissue improving the virulence factors of key periodontal pathogens favors the microenvironment to these pathogens and impairs the immune response of the host 79on the other hand smoking is a risk factor of covid-19 progression being 14 times more probable to have severe covid-19 symptoms 80 additionally as copd smoking could increase the expression of ace-2 78 it was proposed that smoking cessation could decrease the risk of developing severe covid 19 complications 81 however relationship between smoking and severity of covid-19 illness is not completely clear since a meta-analysis suggested not association of active smoking to severity of covid-19 82 it is possible that discrepancies could be due to absence of information as smoking duration or current and ex-smokers in all the analyzed reports 77 thus more deep studies are necessary to determinate the real risk of smokers and progression of covid-19since it is well established that smoking history is association to pd and it could be associated to severe covid-19 77 probably pd in smokers and comorbidities like copd could identify a risk group to severe covid-19asthmaasthma is characterized by chronic inflammation of airways and diverse studies have positively associated asthma and pd 83 84 85 86 it was suggested that asthma could be a risk indicator for periodontal disease in adults even though it not has been established causal relation or a molecular mechanism to explain this association it was proposed that inflammatory factors and genetics 86 or dysbiosis could be involved moreover it is possible that this association is related to a comorbidity or result of medication used for treatment 84it was proposed that asthma could be a risk factor for severe covid-19 illness 87
 however asthma had lower prevalence than that expected in covid 19 patients 88 moreover decreased expression of ace-2 the cellular entry receptor used by sars-cov-2 was reported in patients with asthma 89 it was speculated that lower prevalence might be due to underdiagnosis or lack of recognition of asthma in patients with covid-19 87 88 furthermore asthma patients with dm presented increased expression of ace-2 and tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 and in addition to ace-2 receptor used by sars-cov-2 the entry to cells is dependent on the priming of the spike s protein of this virus by proteases of host as tmprss2 thus increased expression of ace-2 and tmprss2 in these patients could indicate increased susceptibility for sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 morbidity 90 together these observations could suggest that pd could indicate a potential risk of developing severe covid-19 since it has been closely associated with comorbidities like diabetes and asthmahiv human immunodeficiency viruspatients with hiv or a compromised immune function represent a group at higher risk of systemic and oral manifestations 91 92 pd associated with hiv has been studied by several researchers 93 94 95 this possible association has been considered since pd is a source of chronic inflammation 96 some authors suggest that hiv is a contributing factor in the prevalence of pd however results have been inconclusive and the issue is currently controversial 96 97 98on the other hand hiv has been considered a risk factor for covid-19 infection 99 early reports suggest that hiv patients are no more at risk than a non-hiv patient 100 there are not enough studies yet but it is believed that the degree of immunosuppression may contribute to a higher susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection 101cancercancer is a malignant neoplasms disease driven by mutations that cause changes in the genome of normal cells these mutations are consequence by exposition to chemical physical or environmental agents 102 103 104 in recent years pd has been identified as a risk factor that increases the development of cancer 105 this fact has provided valuable information in researches on head and neck cancer 106 prostate cancer 107 breast cancer 108 109 lung cancer 110 111 and hematological cancer 112there is no enough evidence about specific mechanisms of interaction among cancer and pd in this respect several studies have already shown how dysbiosis induces inflammation systemic translocation of periodontal pathogens through the weakened periodontal epithelium systemic immune dysregulation and the increase in circulating cytokines and chemokines 113 114 115 116 according to several studies inflammation can be promoted by microorganisms that increase the risk of developing cancer 117 118patients with cancer are more susceptible to developing severe covid-19 illness in large part owing to the presence of another comorbidity or risk factor 119 120 121therefore their immune response is suppressed by treatments and nutritional deterioration which in turn induces dysbiosis breakdown and increases the possibility of respiratory infections 122 patients with lung cancer are more likely to develop complicating covid-19 123 thus identifying cancer patients with pd could represent a group at risk for severe covid-19oral dysbiosisoral dysbiosis is the loss of the homeostatic balance of the oral microbial communities with the host and it has associated with oral diseases like as pd 21 30 38 the main pathogens associated with pd are porphyromonas gingivalis tanerella forsythia and treponema denticola red-complex but there more pathogenic bacteria including species of the genera prevotella desulfobulbus and selenomona as well as aggregatibacter and others 30 38 124 host factors such as diet and immune system are determinant by the emergence and persistence of dysbiosis that allows the growth of pathobionts and their virulence factors in pd 38 microbial communities execute a mechanism named polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis that allows interaction between bacteria to become a dysbiotic community where pathobionts grow and stimulate inflammation and tissue damage successfully these pathobionts escape from epithelial barriers and an immune over-response of the host through mechanisms such as manipulation of neutrophils inhibition of macrophage response or subversion of complement 19on the other hand in severe covid-19 illness was reported that hospitalized patients with intubation or some life-saving invasive mechanism impaired their oral health also there are other risk factors like the use of drugs routinely or experimentally to attack the sars-cov-2 virus lack of oral hygiene and other comorbidities that can produce dysbiosis of the oral microbiota that could trigger oral diseases like periodontal disease 15 20 125 within a metagenomic analysis of patients with severe covid-19 illness has reported the emergence of genre prevotella fusobacterium veillonella which are associated with periodontal disease 20 additionally some researches suggesting that the virus recognizes the ace-2 receptor which is localized in the nasopharynx but in oral mucosa too 50 therefore the entry of the virus can subvert the immune system and oral microbiota of host triggering a dysbiosis that allows a superinfection understanding of the association of the pd with severe covid-19liver diseasesassociation has been found between pd and liver diseases ld as they are liver cirrhosis lc hepatocellular carcinoma hcc and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld with a prevalence of 20-30 around the world even liver transplantation lt is associated with pd since to avoid sepsis by periodontopathogens the patient has to be examined by an oral professional before lt 126 127 128 129 structural components and products of subgingival microbiome stimulate inflammation of periodontal tissues generating cytokines il-1 il-6 il-10 il-12 and tnf- and inf- 130 that are involved in the progression of liver diseases also the lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis induces liver inflammation 131liver injury by sars-cov-2 is associated at the time of infection occurs and post treatment 132 although it is considered that pre-existing ld patients would be more vulnerable to severe covid-19 because the novel coronavirus bins hepatocytes and cholangiocytes using the ace-2 receptor 133 thus patients with liver diseases and pd could help to identify a group at risk for severe covid-19rheumatoid arthritisaccording to who rheumatoid arthritis ra is a chronic inflammation and disabling disease that affects the joints and connective tissues among other tissues the prevalence ranges from 03-1 several studies reveal that relation between ra and pd exists 134 135 meta-analysis studies show that people with ra get worse when they have pd 136 the molecular mechanism is not entirely clear however a member of the red complex porphyromonas gingivalis is known to produce an enzyme that causes citrullination 135 and periodontal bacteria have been isolated from synovial fluid 134 137nowadays the main concern of rheumatologists in front of covid-19 pandemic is the vulnerability 138 to sars-cov-2 of their patients with ra which is an inflammatory disease because it has been reported that patients with ra have twice the risk of infectious diseases and it also increases mortality when there is bronchopulmonary infection 139 on the other hand they are calm and have had experience in the management of certain medications such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that they are using as a potential treatment for covid-19 140 141 closely association between pd and ra and possible inflammatory and bacterial underlying mechanisms could affect the outcome in patients with covid-19there is enough evidence to propose that pd acts as a risk factor for covid-19 pd has been widely associated with several disorders such as diabetes hta obesity among others thus pd could be indicative of systemic health furthermore these comorbidities and additional factors are common risk factors in patients with severe covid-19 illness since periodontal health status has not been assessed in patients with covid-19 illness it is difficult to determine this association however it is possible that inflammatory microbial and environmental factors could be implicated it has been suggested that inflammatory factors could play important roles in the association of pd with comorbidities in this sense dysregulated inflammatory response also has been observed in severe covid-19 illness contributing to its progressionalterations in oral microbial communities can affect the microenvironment with increases in pathogens and over-stimulation of the immune system 38 co-infection of pathobionts and the sars-cov-2 virus with established risk factors and comorbidities may play a role in increased inflammatory response and cytokine storm 142 on the other hand researchers suggest that exists a close relationship between lung microbiota and admission to intensive care patients have required ventilators for complications associated with bacteria belonging to gut microbiota not commonly found in the lung ecological niche therefore there is a proposal to identify patients with initial gastrointestinal symptoms since that could help predict patient outcomes and help to improve decision making relating preventive measurements and appropriate treatment consequently it would be useful to characterize the microbiome in pd patients with covid-19even though some of the reported risk factors have not been strongly associated with pd or their causal relationships are not completely established it is convincing to propose an association between pd and covid-19 where the latter could be affected by the intervention of periodontopathogenic bacteria outside its ecological niche and cause chronic inflammation additionally it is possible that the association between pd and severe covid-19 illness could be non-causal suggesting that prevention or treatment of pd does not prevent a worse progression and outcome of covid-19 future studies on the periodontal status of patients with covid-19 including from mild to severe forms could allow the opportune identification of people in risk of severe illness and generation of relevant recommendationsthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestcoronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single stranded rna viruses that are distributed broadly among humans which cause respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic diseases1 sars-cov-2 is the agent responsible for the covid-19 it is a beta coronavirus of group 2b with over 70 similarity in genetic sequence to sars-cov-1 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is not an uncommon complication when disease cant be controlled3 the percentage of patients requiring ards treatment is about 10 for those who are actively infected total white blood count lymphocytes and platelets are lower than the average with extended activated thromboplastin time increased c-reactive protein and muscle enzyme level lymphocytes decrease with diseases progression secretion of cytokine such as il1b il1ra il6 il7 il8 known as cytokine storm is associated with disease severity3 4fig 1
therapeutic choices once disease has progressed will be discussed heresars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 show a relatively higher mortality rates then other coronaviruses all of which are associated with the presence of a cytokine storm this might suggest that inflammatory responses play a role in the pathogenesis if that is the case targeting the coronavirus alone with antiviral therapy might not be sufficient to reverse highly pathogenic infections5 these observations led to explore the usage of therapies that included interferons type i and ii interferon beta displayed the best efficacy in reducing mers-cov replication in tissue culture6 7 a randomized control trial is ongoing in south arabia miracle trial to determine whether the combination of antivirals used in hiv infection such as lopinavirritonavir and interferon beta could improve clinical outcomes in mers-cov infections 8 in a humanized transgenic mouse mers-cov infection model remdesivir a drug already being used against sars-cov-2 in patients with severe and moderate disease gs-us-540-57734 studies showed more activity and efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic use then the combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon beta9 this points towards the necessity to explore other options regarding immune system modulation and how control of viraemia is also essentialthe use of immunosuppressants like corticosteroids is quite controversial for some it may be reasonable to counteract the effect of cytokine storm induced by the sars-cov-2 although the recent open label study from wu and colleagues showed a benefit for corticosteroids for now clinical evidence does not support corticosteroid treatment for sars-cov-1 lung injury as it could result in delayed viral clearance10 11il-6 can be produced by almost all stromal cells and by immune system cells such as b lymphocytes t lymphocytes macrophages dendritic cells monocytes mast cells and many non-lymphocytes such as fibroblast and endothelial cells12 main activators of the interleuking-6 il-6 expression are il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor tnf-alfa but many other factors can contribute to its secretion such as toll-like receptors tlrs prostaglandins adipokines stress response and other cytokines13 in the early stage of the infectious inflammation il-6 is produced by monocytes and macrophages stimulated by the tlrs14il-6 plays a crucial role in infectious diseases such as influenza where it has been shown how in a il6-- mice influenza specific cd4 t cell response is impaired15 loss of il-6 results also in persistence of the influenza virus in the lung leading to extreme lung damage and death16 this shows how il-6 limits influenza-induced inflammation and protects against lung damage17 by promoting neutrophil survival in the lung 16 il-6 crucial role is not limited to influenza but also in other infections such as herpes simplex virus-1 hsv-1 infection where il-6 deficient mice shows an increase in infection susceptibility18 in other scenarios such as respiratory syncytial virus rsv infections in mice early depletion of il-6 but not late resulted in significant increase of the disease with an associated influx of cytotoxic cd8 t cells19high levels of interleukin 6 il-6 and interleukin 8 il 8 were found in the acute stage associated with lung lesions in sars-cov-1 patients especially il-6 can induce the hyper-innate inflammatory response due to the sars-cov-1 invasion of the respiratory tract20 interestingly in human epithelial cells sars-cov-1 was able to induce greater il-6 when compared to influenza a virus21 although in some murine viral infections il-6 plays a protective and essential role in the resolution process in others like in sars-cov-1 high levels of il-6 were associated with severe inflammation and correlated with mortality in the mice22 23 this happens also with sars-cov-2 in covid-19 patients some retrospective and meta-analysis studies show how elevated il-6 and c-reactive protein crp correlate with mortality and severe disease in comparison to moderate disease24 25 26 27 more evidence suggests that critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure and sars-cov-2 have either immune dysregulation or macrophage-activation syndrome both of which are characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines the immune dysregulation in particular is driven by the interleukin-6 il-6 and not by interleukin-1beta il-1beta27 two key features of this immune dysregulation are over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and lymphocyte dysregulation with cd4 lymphopenia27a relevant study shows how il-6 plays a major role in acute lung injury ali proof of that was obtained in a murine model where loss of il-6 showed to alleviate the severity of ali in response to acid respiration moreover it was shown how sars-cov-1 has the ability of inducing production of compounds like oxidized phospholipid oxpl both in humans and animals oxpls in turn induce cytokine production and acute lung injury via toll like receptor 4 tlr428 this is evidence of sars-cov-1 ability to indirectly induce acute lung injury and cytokine production like that of il-628 29 tlr4 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the pattern recognition receptor family prr family it recognizes molecules like lipopolysaccharide lps thanks to an accessory protein known as md-230 tlrs activate transcription factors like nfkb ap-1 and irf inducing proinflammatory cytokines expressions and interferon 131 32 33 tlr4 is associated not only with infections but also with tissue damage and this damage-dependent pathway may be amplified in the acute stages of the infection of note tlr4-null mice are highly resistant to infection by the mouse adapted influenza a virus34 protection against influenza infections in mouse models was shown to be achieved by targeting tlr4 with antagonists or with specific anti-receptor antibodies35 another option in targeting host inflammatory response could then be targeting the cellular toll-like-receptor 4 tlr4 furthermore tlr4 seems to regulate il-6 secretion through the nfkb pathway36 this again points towards excessive activation of the innate immune response another proof of that is the damage shown to the pulmonary interstitial arteriolar walls that is more associated with the inflammatory response rather than the pathogenic effect of coronaviruses37an interesting fact is that sars-cov-1 can directly promote il-6 secretion this of course is not the only way it happens since il-6 can be induced by so many types of cells and cytokines as mentioned above among all sars-cov-1 structural proteins nucleocapsid n spike s envelop e and membrane m only the nucleocapsid protein n significantly induced the activation of il-6 promoter in human airway epithelial cell cultures38 il-6 gene expression is activated by the n protein which binds to the nf-kb regulatory element on il-6 promoter and facilitates its translocation from cytosol to nucleus the n protein is essential for il-6 secretion to happen since deletion of the c-terminus of the n protein resulted in the loss of function in the activation of il-638more evidence is emerging of many similarities between macrophage activation syndrome mas disease and covid-19 pneumonia similarities include pathological findings and a second wave of cytokine secretion the loss of front line anti-viral defence mechanism may be responsible for this second wave activation thus prolonging il-6 secretion39 sustained il-6 secretion has also been correlated to serum viral rna load40 in critically ill patients and viral rna load is in turn correlated to ards severity41 all evidence pointing to a possibly detrimental role of il-6 in sars-cov-2 infectionsince high levels of il-6 are associated with sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 infections as shown above and since high serum levels of il-6 have been associated with lung lesions in sars-cov-2 patients in the acute and later stages20 24 25 26 27 42 a valid option could be targeting the expression of il-6 with tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 receptor this option is currently being used in some patients in italy with important lung injuries tocivid-19 study tocilizumab is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases43 this option should be approached only when there are radiological and clinical signs of progression of the lung lesions time decision as when to start clinical administration of anti-il-6 drugs is maybe the most important decision in this scenario since as mentioned before in murine models il-6 is essential in the early stages of other infections to control disease progression19the inclusion criteria for tocilizumab administration for the tocivid trial in italy and for trials in other countries are summarized in table1
here instead are the recommendation criteria used to decide when a patient should be given tociluzumab written by the italian society of infectious and tropical diseases simit societ italiana di malattie infettive e tropicali last update to 13 march 2020end of the initial phase of high viral load of covid-19 patient with no fever for more than 72 hours andor more than 7 days from the symptoms onsetworsening of the respiratory condition requiring invasive or non invasive ventilation supportelevated levels of il-6 more than 40 pgml or high levels of d-dimer andor pcr andor ferritin andor progressive increasingly level of fibrinogen
the signal transduction of il-6 is induced by binding of il-6 to its alpha receptor interleukin-6 receptor il-6r the complex formed by il-6 and its receptor in turn activates a homodimer of the signal transduction beta-receptor gp130 with high affinity44 the gp130 receptor thereupon dimerizes and initiates intracellular signal transduction by activating the jakstat and rasmap kinase pathways45 gp130 is expressed on all cells of the human body il-6 receptor instead is mainly found on hepatocytes some leukocytes and epithelial cells46 the il-6 receptor il-6r protein is subjected to limited proteolysis by a metalloprotease activity which gives rises to a soluble form of il-6r sil-6r47 the majority of the soluble il-6r found in the circulation is proteolytically cleaved from cells by the protease adam1748 49 a minor portion of the sil-6r is generated from an alternatively spliced mrna50 but limited proteolysis remains the major mechanism by which the sil-6r is generated51for signal transduction the il-6r can either be membrane bound classic pathway or soluble trans-signaling pathway51 those two different pathways of signal transduction seem to have different and divergent functionsin the trans signaling the complex of sil-6r and il-6 binds to and activates gp130 even on cells that do not express il-6r52 this is an important mechanism since only a few cells in the human body express il-6r whereas the majority of cells do not show il-6r expression53 54 since all cells express gp130 all of them are in theory possible target cells of il-6 trans signaling52trans-signaling is believed to be involved in chronic inflammation and cancer development55 some animal models showed that when il-6 was acting via the membrane bound il-6r classic signaling it did so in a protective way they also showed that inhibiting trans-signaling was superior to global blockade of il-6 activity by neutralizing antibodies56 this was done using the il-6 trans-signaling inhibitor sgp130fc which is a fusion protein of the gp130 with the fc portion of a human immunoglobulin antibody57 58 in a murine polymicrobial sepsis model selective blockade of il-6 trans-signaling with sgp130fc improved survival up to 100 interestingly treating these mice with anti-il-6r antibodies did not prevent death of the mice56 this is a first hint of how targeting only the il-6r with drugs like tocilizumab might not be enough in a sepsis infectious model furthermore it all points to the trans-signaling transduction being the harmful one pro-inflammatory response and the classic signaling transduction being the protective one anti-inflammatory response59 more evidence of that in some studies showing that elevated serum levels of il-6 which are a marker of disease severity in the inflammatory acute lung injury during acute pancreatitis were mediated by the trans-signaling transduction way as sgp130fc blocked the pancreatitis induced acute lung injury60 moreover in a mouse model of atherosclerosis sgp130fc showed to reduce disease and showed significant regression of the atherosclerotic plaques thus underlying the pro-inflammatory role of the trans-signaling pathway once more61 the sgp130fc protein was shown not to interfere with il-6 signaling via the membrane-bound il-6r mil6-r in contrast il-6 trans-signaling is completely blocked both in vitro and in vivo by the sgp130fc protein46 higher levels of the soluble il-6 receptorsil-6r are usually found in chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer55 in multiple myeloma for example high sil-6r levels were correlated with poor survival62 sil6r levels are also higher in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas63 locally increased sil-6r concentrations were also found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal of asthmatics64 and in malignant ascites from ovarian cancer patients where it was associated with poor prognosis65since sgp130 is expressed in all cells of the human body under normal circumstances it is in molar excess over sil-6r therefore the concentration of the sil-6r limits the capacity of the sil-6rsgp130 complex in the blood during infections and inflammatory states the concentration of sgp130 does not change but the concentration of the sil-6r increases up to 5 fold66 as a consequence il-6 and sil-6r trans-signaling pathway stimulate all cells  which normally are not il-6 target cells like endothelial cells and smooth muscles cells67recent studies about polymorphism within the il-6r genes showed how some il-6 receptor variants could be a much better substrate for the shedding protease adam17 resulting in a reduced response to inflammation and infectious states in terms of sil-6r increase68 those individuals are also protected from many chronic inflammatory diseases69 this is another evidence of the pro-inflammatory role of the trans-signaling pathway and it could also be the explanation as to why some patients show a higher inflammatory response mediated by il-6 similarly to what is happening with sars-cov-2 infectionthe essential role of il-6 in fighting and clearing influenza infection has already been discussed above19 this protective role could be mediated by il-6 classic signaling this also happens for other infections like listeria and mycobacteria infections where il-6 classic signaling via the membrane bound il-6r is responsible for the defense of the body against these pathogens furthermore this defense is not affected by the selective blockade of il-6 trans-signaling70 71 in the animal model of listeriosis global blockade of il-6 led to a dramatic increase in bacterial titers in spleen and liver in contrast selective blockade of il-6 trans-signaling with the sgp130fc protein did not result in increased bacterial titers and thus was concluded that the classic signaling was involved in the protection of the body from bacterial infection71this shows the possibility to use the sgp130fc protein as a potential inhibitor of the il-6 pathway in covid-19 patients since it could preserve the regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties of the il-6 classic pathway and block the pro-inflammatory actions mediated by trans-signaling pathway46 it has been shown that the blockade of il-6 trans-signaling using sgp130fc was as efficient as the global blockade of il-6 classic and trans-signaling using specific monoclonal antibodies72 sgp130fc is mainly used in chronic inflammatory diseases such as intestinal inflammation rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosus neuroinflammation and cancer51 but it has shown its efficacy also in acute inflammation57 and sepsis73 where selective blockade of interleukin-6 trans-signaling improved survival in a murine polymicrobial sepsis model56 an infection where the inhibition of il-6 trans-signaling has shown its efficacy is malaria another infection during which il-6 levels correlate with the severity of the disease in a murine model of il-6r deficient mice the infection showed an increase in survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria inducing il-6 trans-signaling by injection of mouse recombinant soluble il-6r in deficient mice restores the lethal outcome in contrast inhibition of il-6 trans-signaling via injection of sgp130fc protein in wild type mice results in 40 survival rate this demonstrate that trans-signaling rather than classic signaling contributes to malaria lethality in mice74il-6 trans-signaling is also involved in the infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages during the late phase of an acute inflammation and this happens when the trans-signaling triggers the secretion of chemokine mcp-1 in endothelial cells57 as most cells endothelial cells lack the expression of membrane-bound il-6r mil6-r and are then unresponsive to il-6 classic-signaling75 the infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages has been described as the possible cause of tissue damage in the acute lung injury which is a severe complication of severe acute pancreatitis60from these data can be concluded that il-6 classic signaling via the membrane bound il-6r is anti-inflammatory and protective mainly via stimulation of intestinal regeneration inhibition of epithelial cell apoptosis and defense against infections46in contrast trans-signaling via the sil6-r is believed to act in a rather pro-inflammatory way via recruitment of mononuclear cells inhibition of t-cell apoptosis and inhibition of regulatory t-cells differentiation46 interestingly clinical pathological analysis of covid-19 biopsy samples confirmed interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in lung tissues the same type of cells promoted by il-6 trans-signaling76 therefore suggesting a possible involvement of trans-signaling pathway of il-6 in covid-19 patients with ards moreover il-6 production sustained by circulating monocytes in covid-19 is a different pathway from the one found in influenza infection proof of that is tocilizumab partially rescuing the immune dysregulation drive by sars-cov-227to the authors knowledge sgp130fc has not been tested in covid-19 patients yet thus the author suggests its possible use against sars-cov-2 in severe cases of covid-19 patients adopting the same criteria of tocilizumab as to when to start the treatment this option would provide the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory trans-signaling pathway of il-6 instead of targeting them both which is something that happens with tocilizumab51both the trans-signaling and the classic-signaling pathways of il-6 converge in the activation of the jakstat pathway and the mapk cascade77 the next step after binding of il-6 to il-6r and sgp130 is then to initiate intracellular signal transduction the signal transfer is performed by the janus-kinasesignal transducer and activator of transcription jakstat-mainly stat1 stat3 isoforms78 79 80 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk- and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase pi3k-pathway44 77 another possible way of counteracting il-6 action is then to inhibit its intracellular transduction pathway though in doing so the benefit of specifically targeting the pro-inflammatory trans-signaling pathway is lostthis can be done by inhibiting the jak 12 pathway with drugs like ruxolitinib ruxolitinib is a small drug belonging to the class of janus kinase jak inhibitors and currently clinically used in the treatment of jak2 mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms including myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera81 82 it shows activity against the jak2 isoform and also the jak1 isoform which plays a major role in the signaling pathway of inflammatory cytokines83 jak3 seems to be less sensitive to ruxolitinib84 it also shows anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in its clinical use85 it is also implicated in the suppression of the harmful consequences of macrophage activation hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis86 which is an under-recognized hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multi organ failure87 it has been proven that the expression of major inflammatory cytokines such as tnf alfa and il6 was highly reduced in inflammatory human macrophages exposed to ruxolitinib85 it has also been shown through an analysis of mrna expression of cytokines by pcr array that the major inflammatory cytokines  il-6 and tnf alfa were highly reduced and down-regulated by ruxolitinib at both protein and mrna level88 all these results point towards a possible use of ruxolitinib as an il-6 inhibitor like tocilizumab in the advanced stages of covid-19 this drug is currently being tested in some patients in italy cinc424 ruxolitinibbaricitinib has been suggested to be of therapeutic use against sars-cov-2 by artificial intelligence algorithms89 it is a selective and powerful jak-stat signaling inhibitor thus being effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines not only being able of lowering il-6 levels90 but it also has the potential to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells it targets members of the numb-associated kinase nak family aak1 and gak the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro91 it can be administered orally and has acceptable side effect profile besides having little interaction with cyp enzymes and drug transporters89 this makes baricinitib a valid option in every phase of the viral infection the early stages to reduce viral entry in the cells and later stages for its anti-inflammatory propertiesother monoclonal antibodies against il-6 are sirukumab cnto136 olokizumab cp6038 pf-423691 elsilimomab be-8 clazakizumab bms945429 which are in different phases of clinical trials to establish their efficacy and safety in varied disease states92 93 94 95 96 97 sarilumab another monoclonal antibody against il-6 is being tested in a clinical trial against covid-19 sarilimumab covid-19 another drug that showed potential inhibition of il-6 related jakstat pathway is glatiramer acetate which showed potential to downregulate both il-17 and il-6 in the central nervous system in an autoimmune encephalitis98here the author showed the viable options against the cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 showing that besides tocilizumab other options must be taken into account and that inhibiting il-6 is not a simple thing to do since it has at least two different and divergent pathways thus suggesting to inhibit only the pro-inflammatory response the trans-signaling transduction with sgp130fc which seems a more reasonable choice then inhibiting both pathways here also other possible choices in counteracting il-6 mediated activities are shown like ruxolitinib and baricitnib in the hope to find new possible strategies and discovering new properties of the drugs already available since this would mean accelerating clinical trials as their side effects and tolerability in humans are already knownthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperin the past decades two known pathogenic human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov have been reported to damage the respiratory tract and cause high morbidity and mortality 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered coronavirus was reported at december 2019 2019-ncov in the city wuhan hubei province china 2 up to 21th of march 2020 81416 cases have been reported with 3261 fatal cases according to the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc meanwhile 190000 cases have been reported with 7992 fatal cases in other countries except china in italy to date there are about 47021 infected and 4032 deaths 3 a global outbreak of the sars-cov-2 caused corona virus disease covid-19 seems inevitable among these covid-19 patients most of them have the common symptoms including fever cough and myalgia or fatigue at onset the majority of patients can recover however about 25 of patients will progress into severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which may worsen rapidly into respiratory failure need an intensive care unit icu and even cause multiple organ failure 4 5 therefore the exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe covid-19 is crucially important at the momentalthough virus-induced cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to be important in disease severity studies from humans who died of sars and mers suggested that an aberrant host immune response resulting in an inflammatory cytokine storm and lethal disease 1 similar to the inflammatory cytokines in sars and mers patients with covid-19 also have increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor  tnf-interleukins il 2 7 and 10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha and interferon--inducible protein 10 especially in icu patients which implied a cytokine storm occurred 4moreover covid-19 patients have decreased lymphocytes in peripheral blood and characteristic pulmonary ground glass changes on imaging 4 5 most importantly in the biopsy samples at autopsy from patients who died from covid-19 histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage including edema proteinaceous exudate focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration and multinucleated giant cells 6 7 it also has been recovered from autopsy examination that type ii alveolar epithelial cells proliferate markedly with some cells exfoliated the alveolar septum is hyperemic edematous with clear intravascular thrombosis focal monocytes lymphocytes and plasma cells are infiltrating into pulmonary interstitium immunohistochemistry results showed positive for immunity cells including cd3 cd4 cd8 cd20 cd79a cd5 cd38 and cd68 8 these phenomena further suggest severe pulmonary inflammatory immune cells exist in sars-cov-2 infection therefore increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe covid-19 patientsinflammatory storm refers to an excessive inflammatory response flaring out of control and the immune system gone awry to identify which kind of immune cells are involved in and which inflammatory cytokine is the critical target in these severe covid-19 patients we analyzed peripheral blood samples from patients with severe or critical covid-19 from the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china and observed monocytes and t cells from severe or critical covid-19 patients decreased significantly compared to normal controls these aberrant pathogenic t cells from critical icu care covid-19 patients showed activated characteristic accompanied with co-expressing ifn- and gm-csf this phenomenon aroused our alarm for gm-csf has the capability to control diverse pathogenic capabilities of inflammatory myeloid cells especially monocytes 9 as expected inflammatory monocyte with cd14cd16 phenotype exists in peripheral blood of covid-19 patients and has larger population in critical covid-19 patients from icu note that without any re-stimulation with pma or incubation with monensin large amount of il-6 could be tested from these inflammatory monocytes especially in icu patients therefore these pathogenic th1 cells gm-csfifn- and inflammatory monocytes cd14cd16 with high expression of il-6 exist especially in critical icu covid-19 patients 10 given that large amount of mononuclear inflammatory lymphocytes have been observed in the biopsy samples at autopsy from covid-19 patients we believe that these pathogenic t cells and inflammatory monocytes may enter the pulmonary circulation in large numbers and incite inflammatory storm in severe or critical covid-19 patients fig 1tocilizumab is the first marketed il-6 blocking antibody through targeting il-6 receptors and has proved its safety and effectiveness in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis fig 2 in order to verify whether targeted il-6 may potentially be the effective and safe way to reduce mortality of covid-19 21 patients diagnosed as severe or critical covid-19 from the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china and anhui fuyang second peoples hospital were recruited and given tocilizumab therapy table 1 patients received standard treatment according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19 7th edition including lopinavir methylprednisolone other symptom relievers and oxygen therapy the results of tocilizumab treatment are inspiring the temperature of all the patients returned to normal very quickly the respiratory function and all other symptoms improved remarkably among these 21 patients 20 patients have been recovered and discharged within 2 weeks after the tocilizumab therapy one left patient is recovering and out of icu care no adverse drug reactions were reported during the treatment with tocilizumab 11 with these promising preliminary clinical results we further launched the multicenter large-scale clinical trials chictr2000029765 and have already about 500 severe or critical patients treated this waythe immunotherapy strategy about tocilizumab treatment has been formally included in the diagnosis and treatment program of covid-19 7th edition of the national health commission of china since 3th march 2020 as following tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive bilateral lung lesions opacity or in severe or critical patients who have elevated laboratory detected il-6 levels the first dose is 48 mgkg the recommended dose is 400 mg diluted to 100 ml with 09 normal saline and the infusion time is more than 1 h for patients with poor initial efficacy an additional application can be made after 12 h the dose is the same as before the maximum number of times of administration is two and the maximum dose of a single dose should not exceed 800 mg note that patients with allergic reactions such as tuberculosis and other active infection are contraindicated we suggest that il-6 concentrations can be detected if fever persists for more than 3 days by chemiluminescence detection if serum il-6 content is over 20 pgml tocilizumab can be used the il-6 will be temporarily increased in serum in the next few days for its receptors have been blocked by tocilizumab together tocilizumab treatment is recommended to reduce the mortality of severe covid-19all three coronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 induce aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with severe lung pathology the new sars-cov-2 additionally causes serious alveolar mucus infiltration and multiple organ failure as the sars-cov-2 continues to spread the numbers of fatal cases rise exponentially in many countries advancing novel therapeutic development becomes crucial to minimize the number of deaths from covid-19 in the absence of specific antiviral drugs existing host-directed therapies could potentially be repurposed to treat covid-19 chinas plan of tocilizumab treatment has shown its remarkable effectiveness and safety in clinical practice over the past 2 months hoping it will benefit other countries fighting the pandemic and reduce the mortality of severe covid-19 as well
on 7 january 2020 after a cluster of cases with pneumonia of unknown origin in wuhan hubei china researchers isolated a novel coronavirus then called sars-cov-2 1 and covid-19 the induced diseasesars-cov-2 is believed to have zoonotic origins probably from the huanan seafood market in wuhan and has close genetic similarity 96 to a bat coronavirus suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus 2 an intermediate animal reservoir such as the pangolin is also thought to be involved in its introduction to humans but efforts to identify intermediate hosts seem to have been unsuccessful 34 since the outbreak thanks to its contagiousnessvirulence characteristics and boosted by globalization sars-cov-2 moved around the world faster than a virus has ever done beforeafter three months since its appearance it reached 15  106 infected patients with 35  105 recovered patients and 100000 deaths across the world 4 due to a number of unfortunate variables northern italy was the first country outside of asia affected by the rapid spreading of sars-cov-2 which led at the end of march to the highest number of deaths worldwide 4 typical clinical manifestations of the disease generally begin after less than 57 days of incubation and consist of fever cough fatigue and mild dyspneahowever data from china reported that about 1520 of patients have severe disease with interstitial pneumonia which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 56 pneumonia includes decreased oxygen saturation with severe bilateral ground glass abnormalities patchy consolidation and alveolar exudates 56 in patients with ards the virus can induce an excessive and aberrant host immune response characterized by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines resembling the clinical and serological features of cytokine release syndrome crs crs is a life-threatening emergency associated with high mortality thus an early identification is essential at the moment there are no specific antiviral treatments recommended for sars-cov-2 and no vaccine is currently available a growing awareness of sars-cov-2 infection and crs has led to exploring the use of immunomodulatory drugs as a potential treatment for the management of these patientshere the complex relationship between infections and autoimmunity in the emergency scenario of the sars-cov-2 pandemic is discussed we critically review the rationale for the adoption of immunosuppressive agents commonly used in autoimmune diseases in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection and report current knowledge of ongoing studiescrs is a systemic inflammatory life-threatening condition typically associated with biological drug products but also occurring during the response to some infections 7 initially described as a reaction to the use of the anti-cd3 okt3 monoclonal antibody mab 8 this syndrome is the result of a cytokine storm crs has been under tight evaluation since it caused the admission to the intensive care unit of six healthy individuals enrolled in the phase i trial for the anti-cd28 mab tgn1412a in 2006 9 crs has been also observed in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or t cell therapy car t cells 10 it is noteworthy that the cytokine storm due to massive t cell stimulation is also considered a relevant mechanism to the h5n1 influenza pathogenesis 11 crs and sepsis share several symptoms and patients with crs are at a high risk of infections not only for the immunosuppressive treatments but likely also for the crs-associated immune dysregulation and tissue damages especially at the mucosa barrier indeed in crs patients infections principally involve the respiratory tractthe exacerbated reaction to infections or to biological therapy is caused by the rapid recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and alter the fragile balance between a controlled immune response and a host-damaging reaction damaged tissues release molecules normally not present outside the cells including high-mobility group box 1 hmgb1 atp uric acid and dna further amplifying inflammatory responses all these molecules are part of the so-called damage-associated molecular patterns damps it is noteworthy that pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps and damps are recognized by the same group of innate immunity receptors namely the pathogen recognition receptors prrs which include toll-like receptors tlrs highly expressed in neutrophils and macrophages engagement of tlrs and other prrs leads to further activation of nf-b and the release of cytokines il-6 tnf il-1 etc and other mediators of inflammationa relevant biological role has also been proposed for ferritin in crs-related conditions as well as in autoimmune disease has been proposed the presence of hyperferritinemia indeed is a well-known feature in patients with different autoimmune conditions such as ra systemic lupus erythematosus sle and anti-phospholipid syndrome 12 it has been supposed that several mechanisms involving the inhibition the h-ferritin-mediated suppression of immune cells may favor the loss of tolerance and the onset of autoimmunity 13 ferritin can be also a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule and hyperferritinemia has been associated with different crs-related conditions such as macrophage activation syndrome mas and septic shock 14ferritin could exert a pathogenic role in these diseases rather than being just the result of hyperinflammation in fact ferritin synthesis is mediated not only by iron availability but also by il-1 il-6 and tnf 1516 which are overexpressed during crs on the other hand it can induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines thus becoming part of a vicious loop 17 in particular it has been hypothesized that during an ongoing infection the signaling mediated by bacterialviral cpg dna and tlr9 could activate the inflammasome leading to il-1 and il-18 production 181920 through damp signaling infection could also increase the production of hemoglobin 21 and activate macrophages which are prominent producers of ferritin 2223 amplifying the inflammatory loop 23 moreover a correlation between the serum levels of cd163 a marker of macrophage activation 24 and ferritin in patients with mas has been reported 25 different therapeutic approaches could be useful in blocking this pathway at different levels such as plasma exchange intravenous immunoglobulins or mabs against il-1 and il-18 18in patients affected by 20022003 sars-cov immune dysregulation induced an abnormal inflammatory cytokine production by alveolar macrophages with a concomitant t cell dysfunction involving both cd4 and cd8 t cells 26 sars patients with a more severe disease displayed higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn- il-1 il-6 and chemokines including il-8 27 in crs ifn- further activates immune cells especially macrophages which are induced to produce more inflammatory cytokines and upregulate costimulatory ligands feeding the harmful positive loop of inflammation it is important to remember that type i interferons ifns play a critical role in the normalphysiologic immune response to viruses by enhancing the toxic effects of cd8 t cells 28 activating nk cells and restricting viral pathogenicity to the lung microenvironment ifnr-deficient mice infected with the h5n1 or the 1918 influenza virus show indeed higher mortality than wild-type mice which display systemic dissemination of the virus 29 it is noteworthy that some studies showed that coronaviruses in particular mers-cov can suppress the expression of both type i and type iii ifns evading innate immune response and contributing to its pathogenicity 30 in in vitro models ifn- showed effects against 20022003 sars-cov and mers-cov suggesting a possible use to control viral infections by coronavirus interestingly the expression of the type iii ifn receptors is more restricted to specific cell types neutrophils and b cells compared with type i ifn receptors a feature that could restrain inflammatory response to the initial site of infection in an animal model treatment with ifn-2il-28a reversed the development of collagen-induced arthritis also indicating an anti-inflammatory role in autoimmune responses 31 however in the contest of crs associated with covid-19 it cannot be excluded that type iii ifn receptors are upregulated also in other cell types and that these cytokines could also contribute to the complex pathogenic process 32in sars-cov-2 patients with a worse prognosis il-6 il-10 and tnf- quickly rise and reach high levels conversely in patients with milder symptoms these cytokines reach lower levels with their expression rising and declining during the illness and recovery phase respectively 33 the production of il-10 an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the context of crs is often associated with the downregulation of neutrophil and monocyte function a phenomenon termed immunoparalysis 34 although conceptually beneficial the persistent downregulation of hla-dr on monocytes after sepsis as well as after crs leads to higher mortality rates suggesting that the recovery from immunoparalysis is critical for patient survival 35 as above mentioned systemic cytokines are considered to be massively produced by macrophages in sars-cov-2 patients 36 however also endothelial cells play a relevant role in crs not only as cells that are damaged by pathogens and inflammatory responses but also as co-culprits endothelial cells indeed produce inflammatory cytokines including il-6 and upregulate adhesion molecules further promoting leukocytes recruitment and capillary leakage 37 in line with lymphocyte recruitment into the place of infectioninflammation two recent studies showed that in patients with severe covid-19 t cell lymphopenia is accompanied by an alteration in the distribution of circulating t cell subpopulations patients indeed have increased frequencies of naive helper t cells and a reduction in memory helper t cells 3839 the cytokine unbalance associated with the response to sars-cov-2 could also affect the effectiveness of the immune response both in terms of viral clearance and future immune protection for some of the recovered patients protective antibodies have been described they are mainly directed towards the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and most likely they interfere with viral entry 40 even if the majority of patients recover some of them after discharge from the hospital asymptomatic and negative rt-pcr viral rna tests remainreturn positive or even relapse 41 due to the limited number of described cases incomplete virus clearance rather than lack of protection cannot be ruled out noteworthy previous studies on 20022003 sars-cov showed heterogeneous results on b and t cell memory 424344 information on the long-term quality of immune response t and b cell immunological memory and long- versus short-lived plasma cells towards sars-cov-2 is not available yetaltogether these recent findings point to a major role of the host immune response particularly of crs as a determining co-factor in the severe life-threating form of covid-19 why some patients develop an effective immune response which is protective and not pathogenic and why others have a non-protective life-threatening immune response is a key question it is likely that genetic background which is also involved in inflammatory responses immune-mediated diseases including autoimmunity and co-morbidities may not only weaken the host but also may share common pathways in inflammatory damaging responsestreatment of crs involves the use of both antiviral agents to control the underlying infection and immunosuppressants to lower the aberrant pro-inflammatory response of the hostfor a better understanding it is essential to remind about the natural course of sars-cov-2 infectionafter the incubation period indeed the virus induces flu-like symptoms typical of mild disease in some patients the infection can progress to interstitial pneumonia moderate disease or severe pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy severe disease through to ards with respiratory failure 45 this is probably the moment at which the shift from a controlled immune response to a host-damaging reaction begins to manifest clinically then sars-cov-2 does not directly induce tissue damage whereas the hyperinflammatory immune activation of the host becomes the effective protagonist of the disease the early identification of this specific moment of transition is of key importance to allow timely immunomodulatory intervention thus achieving a tailored approach and the best therapeutic effects figure 1to that end several serologic markers have been proposed such as the presence of thrombocytopenia lymphopenia and increased levels of d-dimer and ferritin 46some authors have also reported a role for il-6 and il-10 in monitoring covid-19 patients in particular significantly higher levels of il-6 and il-10 have been identified in severe covid-19 patients than in the milder forms thus suggesting that these cytokines can be used to predict the transition from mild to severe infection 47hydroxychloroquine hiq is an orally administered and low-cost drug widely used as a monotherapy in clinical rheumatological practice mainly to treat the mild form of rheumatoid arthritis ra sle and sjogrens syndrome patients as well as in combination therapy with conventional immunosuppressants in more severe patients hiq has a pleiotropic activity ranging from immunomodulatory effects to anti-thrombotic action and antiviral properties the immunomodulatory activity of hiq has been demonstrated in vitro to be exerted by several mechanismshiq interferes with lysosomal activity impairing lysosomal and autophagosome functions and subsequently immune activation 48 it can inhibit tlr-7 and tlr9 49 signaling pathways and decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 tnf- il-1 ifn- 50 the anti-thrombotic mechanism is still poorly clarified anyway it has been reported that it can reverse platelet activation and reduce anti-phospholipid apl antibody titers in apl patients 51 it can also improve endothelial dysfunction and reduce the expression of adhesion molecules such as vcam-1 and e-selectin 52 mechanisms that could be relevant in severe covid-19regarding the antiviral effects it is known that hiq is able to block the infection of different viruses including sars-cov-1 by increasing endosomal ph and by interfering with the glycosylation of the cellular receptor 5354 several in vitro studies have been conducted to explore its efficacy in blocking sars-cov-2 infection chloroquine was found to inhibit the virus at a low micromolar concentration with a half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 113 m and a half cytotoxic concentration cc50 greater than 100 m which can be achievable with the standard dosing regimen 55 in a recent study hiq was found to have a higher antiviral effect than chloroquine with a lower ec50 56 as a consequence of these encouraging results at least 23 clinical trials are being carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chloroquine or hiq in the treatment of sars-cov-2 patients 57 by now the results have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings and promoting a virus-negative conversion without serious adverse events 58 a guideline document promoted by the italian society of infectious and tropical disease recommends the use of chloroquine 300 mg  2day or hiq 200 mg x 2day in patients presenting with mild respiratory symptoms and comorbidities as well as in patients with severe respiratory failure 59il-6 is a pleotropic cytokine with several immunological activities it plays a role in the differentiation of mature b cells into plasma cells and combined with tgf- it induces the differentiation of naive cd4 positive t cells into th17-cells and induces the production of acute-phase proteins such as crp fibrinogen serum amyloid a and hepcidin 6061 in bone marrow il-6 induces the maturation of megakaryocytes into platelets and the activation of hematopoietic stem cells 6061tocilizumab and sarilumab are a humanized and human mab respectively recognizing the soluble and membrane-bound forms of the il-6 receptor they are part of the first line biological therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ra and juvenile idiopathic arthritis more recently tocilizumab has been scheduled also for giant cell arteritis patients 61 it is of note that il-6 in combination with tgf-  is also produced by fibroblasts and activated macrophages exerting a pro-fibrotic effect at different sites such as lungs skin and liver 61 in a recent work we proposed tocilizumab as a valid therapeutic strategy in patients with interstitial pneumonitis associated with ra because it might contrast the pro-fibrotic effects of il-6 ameliorating both the articular and lung involvement 62 this observation was recently confirmed by other authors 63 as reported above in some patients sars-cov-2 infection can induce an uncontrolled and aberrant host hyperimmune response that is associated with lung damage and fibrosis leading to life-threatening multi-organ failure serologically an increase in the serum concentrations of il-1 il-6 il-2 il-7 il-10 tnf- granulocyte colony-stimulating factor interferon--inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1- has been found 646566 furthermore different chinese authors reported that a lower lymphocyte count and elevated crp ferritin d-dimer and il-6 were poor prognostic factors in sars-cov-2 patients 67the efficacy of tocilizumab in resolving life-threatening crs during car t cell therapies was assessed in small patient cohorts 7 however the striking positive results led to its rapid approval for the treatment of crs by the fda in 2017 followed by ema in 2018 6869 based on these data small retrospective studies on patients affected by severe covid-19 demonstrated that tocilizumab improved ct scan ground glass lesions and oxygen saturation normalized crp levels and lymphocyte count in a significant percentage of patients 7071il-6 inhibitors should be initiated at the early stages of hyperinflammation after discussion between critical care medicine and hematologyrheumatology and infection specialists one additional dose may be considered if clinical deterioration persists max two doses per course in severe sars-cov-2 7273 a multicenter randomized clinical trial rct of tocilizumab has been approved in china and is currently ongoing in patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia and elevated il-6 levels chictr2000029765several clinical trials on the use of tocilizumab in patients with covid-19 are already posted on clinicaltrialsgov these trials are enrolling different sets of the covid-19 population ranging from patients with recent onset pneumonia to life-threatening-associated crsthere is also heterogenicity among the primary outcomes but those mainly used are the proportion of subjects with normalization of fever and oxygen saturation at 14 days the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu admission and the one-month mortality rate the increase in lymphocyte count decrease in crp and amelioration of ct lung opacity are frequently reported secondary endpoints nct04317092another five trials have been posted on clinicaltrialsgov on the use of sarilumab in covid-19 patients three of which have started recruitment two studies are enrolling hospitalized covid-19 patients aiming at evaluating the safety and effectiveness of low or high dose iv sarilumab nct04315298 nct04327388 the other study is recruiting patients with moderatesevere pneumonia associated with sars-cov-2 and the primary endpoint is the survival without the need for ventilator utilization at day 14 nct04324073in addition to il-6 also il-1 plays an important role in crs 7475 il-1 and il-1 increase acute-phase signaling homing of immune cells to the site of primary infection and epithelial cell activation both inducing the production of many other cytokines 7576 il-1 can also drive proinflammatory activity in the respiratory tract as shown by its presence in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with lung injury 76anakinra is a 17 kd recombinant non-glycosylated human il-1ra that blocks il-1 and il-1 it was approved for treating ra cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and stills disease 77 it has been reported to be safe and effective in the management of sepsis-associated mas in particular those with increased liver enzymes hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia 78 conversely the other anti-il1 inhibitor canakinumab has not been demonstrated to be beneficial in mas 79 as of now four clinical trials are recruiting patients with covid-19 severe acute respiratory failure and crs aiming at evaluating the safety and effectiveness of anakinra alone or in combination with anti-il-6 agents nct04330638 nct0432402 nct04357366 nct04339712janus kinase inhibitors also known as jak inhibitors are a class of orally administered targeted synthetic immunosuppressants that act by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the jak family members jak1 jak2 jak3 tyk2 thereby interfering with the jak-stat signaling pathway several inflammatory cytokines involved in autoimmunity diseases by binding to their receptors initiate a jak dependent phosphorylation cascade constituting the signaling pathway of gene transcription hence drugs that inhibit the activity of jak block cytokine signalingthese inhibitors have therapeutic application in the treatment of cancer ra psoriasis psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases 80 by now three jak inhibitors are approved for the treatment of rheumatic conditions tofacitinib baricitinib and upadacitinib tofacitinib is a specific inhibitor of jak3 and to a lesser extent jak1 and jak2 baricitinib reversibly inhibits jak1 and jak2 with moderate activity against tyk2 and significantly less against jak3 whereas upadacitinib is a selective inhibitor of jak1 81 pharmacology studies in vitro demonstrated that all three anti-jak antibodies can inhibit jak12-dependent cytokines il-6 and ifn- and the jak1tyk2-dependent cytokines il-10 and ifn- whereas tofacitinib and upadacitinib are the most potent inhibitors of the jak13-dependent cytokines il-2 il-4 il-15 and il-21 81 considering the above data the adoption of these drugs for crs management could be useful indeed preclinical studies on murine models of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh and mas showed the efficacy of jak inhibition 8283jak inhibitors have also gained the attention of researchers in the scenario of sars-cov-2 infection for their demonstrated antiviral properties most viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis one of the known regulators of endocytosis is the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 thus aak1 inhibitors can interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and can be helpful in preventing virus infections 84 among aak1 inhibitors baricitinib has shown the highest affinity being able to inhibit aak1 at the standard therapeutic dosage for ra 85 furthermore the use of baricitinib appears to be particularly safe also in combination with antiviral drugs considering its minimal interaction with the cyp drug-metabolizing enzymes 86 tofacitinib showed no detectable inhibition of aak1 whereas no data are yet available on the effect of upadacitinib on aak1 87currently an italian trial is recruiting patients with mild to moderate sars-cov-2 infection nct04320277 patients will be treated with a combination of baricitinib and antiviral therapy with ritonavir the primary endpoint of the trial is the percentage of patients requiring transfer to icu as compared with the rate of transfers observed in controls another european trial is starting recruitment of patients with moderate to severe sars-cov-2 infection baricitinib will be used in monotherapy compared to lopinavirritonavir hiq and il-6 inhibitor nct04321993 all administered alonetnf- belongs to a large family of cytokines known as the tnf superfamily it is produced mainly by activated macrophages nk t and b cells and exerts its action through two receptors called tnfr1 and tnfr2 after binding to its receptors tnf- leads to a myriad and often conflicting effects reflecting complex cross-talk mechanisms 88 it can mediate both apoptosis and cell activation proliferation of b cells and enhancement of cytotoxic activity of nk cells the nf-b activation pathway following tnf- binding also induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 il-6 and il-8 leading to extensive tissue damage such as vascular leakage and lung injury seen in many chronic inflammatory diseases 8990 as for il-6 tnf- is responsible for systemic inflammatory manifestations such as fever and cachexia and has been shown to be a central cytokine in the activation and maintenance of crs 75 tnf- is a potent antiviral cytokine that acts directly by killing the virus-infected cells prior to maximal virus replication however it is known that the viral spike protein of sars-cov-2 is able to induce a tnf--converting enzyme tace-dependent shedding of the ace2 ectodomain which is coupled to tnf- production and is crucial for the penetration of the virus into the cell 9091 based on these observations tnf- appeared to be an attractive therapeutic target treatment of mas patients with etanercept a fusion protein made from the combination of two soluble human 75k tnf-r linked to an fc portion of an igg1 has already been described but data are scarce and contradictory 9293 a trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of adalimumab human mab directed against tnf- in sars-cov-2 patients with severe respiratory failure and crs has recently been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry chictr2000030089rituximab rtx is a chimeric anti-cd20 mab approved for the treatment of b cell malignancies ra and anca-associated vasculitis 949596b cell ablation with rituximab has been observed to have efficacy in macrophage activation syndrome in patients with underlying epstein-barr virus ebv 97 the proposed mechanism is the reduction of viral load via destruction of the reservoir of ebv-infected cells unfortunately rtx therapy has been shown to induce crs probably caused by the rapid destruction of tumor cells and consequent changes of serum cytokine levels 98 it seems that crs is a side effect of rtx therapy considering that it occurs mainly in patients with a very high tumor burden thus its use appears not to be indicated in crs secondary to sars-cov-2 infection crs occurring during sars-cov-2 infection has a clinical and serological profile resembling that of secondary hlh given the central role of cd8 t cells in secondary hlh non-ablative inhibitors of t cell function are also attractive therapeutic choices 74 cyclosporine cys is a cyclic undecapeptide that binds intracellularly to cyclophilin and suppresses calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin pathway activation functional consequences are the block of t cell survival and activation and inhibition of il-2 production 99100 it is used for the prevention of transplant rejection as well as in different autoimmune conditions such as ra psoriasis and glomerulonephritis 101 it has already been adopted as part of the standard protocol in familiar hlh patients 102 it could also be relevant to underline that cys is able to inhibit in vitro the function of a transmembrane protein called p-glycoprotein that pumps out of the cell several drugs including amprenavir indinavir nelfinavir ritonavir and saquinavir thus being crucial in the development of drug resistance to anti-retroviral therapy cys has also been demonstrated to revert in vivo drug resistance to methotrexate in ra and psoriatic arthritis psa patients 103104on the basis of the anti-inflammatory activity and its ability to improve the effectiveness of antiviral therapy low dose cys in combination with antiviral drugs might be rational in selected patients without severe renal involvement abatacept is a dimeric fusion protein composed of the human ctla-4 extracellular domain and a human fcigg1 that binds with high-affinity cd80cd86 molecules thus impairing t cell activation and t-b cell cross-talk during the immune response 103105 it is scheduled for use in ra and more recently psa patients abatacept has been proposed as a valid option for interstitial lung disease associated with ra in several case series 106 and has already been proven in a few cases of mas refractory to standard intervention demonstrating mild effectiveness and safety 107 the main data on the use of anti-rheumatic drugs currently tested in clinical trials of covid-19 patients are resumed in table 1as previously stated sars-cov-2 infection represents an emergency scenario of an old challenge which is the complex and interwoven link between infections and autoimmunity this complex link has implications at the biological level in terms of individual susceptibilityresistance as well as in the delicate balance to be reached with therapeutic options polymorphisms in the hla locus have been shown to affect individual susceptibility with variants that confer resistance to some viral infections and predispose to autoimmune diseases and others that show more complex associations increasing the risks for both autoimmunity and infections 108 susceptibility to several infectious diseases including hiv hepatitis b and influenza is associated with specific hla haplotypes for instance hla-a11 hla-b35 and hla-drb110 have been shown to correlate with susceptibility to influenza a h1n1 infection it would be important therefore to understand if specific hla loci are associated with susceptibility to sars-cov-2 or to the development of a protective immune response while it is still early to have information on sars-cov-2 and hla studies on 20022003 sars-cov did not show associations with hla-a hla-b and hla-drb1 allele frequencies 109 whereas some variants of hla-drb1 seem to correlate with susceptibility to mers 110 noteworthy some hla-drb1 amino acid variants are associated with ra conferring either susceptibility or resistance to this disease 108patients with autoimmune diseases are indeed at high risk of infections due to endogenous dysfunctional immune system and external factors ie immunosuppressants in ra patients the risk for infections is about double with respect to healthy individuals and they are mainly located at the bone and joints skin soft tissues and respiratory levels 111 in ra patient data on infection risk generally show that methotrexate the gold standard immunosuppressants for inflammatory arthritis and hiq are the therapies impacting the least in the increased susceptibility to infection both being considered relatively safe 112113 the risk of infections observed in ra patients treated with biologic drugs is generally reported to be higher compared with patients receiving conventional immunosuppressants 114115 in a retrospective observational cohort-study our group evaluated the role of methotrexate corticosteroids and tnf- antagonists alone or in combined therapy on non-serious and serious infections in ra and spondyloarthritis spa patients we identified an incidence ratio100 patient-years of 363 for all infections being 349 for non-serious and 14 for serious infections 116 these results are similar to those reported from the corrona register on a larger ra us patient population 117 as confirmed by other authors we also found that the combination of anti-tnf- with corticosteroids was the most pro-infective treatment whereas methotrexate alone was relatively safe 116117118119the corticosteroidsanti-tnf- combination can indeed synergize in lowering tnf- levels through different and independent mechanisms with the consequent increase of the anti-inflammatory effect but at the expense of a rise in the risk of infection 118119 as reported by metanalyses and real-life studies among biological agents abatacept seems to be the safest in terms of infectious risk 120121 autoimmune diseases and infections are already linked with alteration in disease activity in autoimmune patients indeed infections may induce disease flare-up that may be followed by a severe clinical course representing a frequent cause of death 2055 122 on the other hand it is known that a higher disease activity is associated with a higher probability of developing infections 117 in fact high disease activity is the result of chronic inflammation against self which can exhaust the immune resources and deviate the immune response from the danger signals delivered by pathogens 123 conversely infections may stimulate the immune system thus leading to a reactivation of the underlying autoimmune disease in view of the above it is not surprising that although autoimmune patients under immunosuppressive agents could be prone to sars-cov-2 infections suspension of the ongoing conventional and biological therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares with a consequent increased risk of infection 124it could be hypothesized that the impairment of immune response caused by the ongoing therapy could be a double-edged sword on the one hand indeed immunosuppression increases the risk and consequently the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infections in autoimmune patients but on the other hand it could decrease the risk of the aberrant hyperinflammatory response seen in patients with sars-cov-2 a registry of covid-19 in autoimmune patients has been created by the italian society of rheumatology this registry could give useful information to clarify the above hypothesis and be of crucial help for therapeutic decision-making in this particular group of patients whatever these results will show one should keep in mind that co-infection can often be lethal and thus the use of anti-influenza and anti-pneumococcal vaccinations already recommended in these patients 125 assumes even more importance in this new scenario of the covid-19 pandemicseveral trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressants commonly used in autoimmune patients are ongoing in patients with covid-19 and crs some of which are achieving promising results however such a use should follow a multidisciplinary specialist approach be accompanied by close monitoring be tailored to patients clinical and serological features and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results it is also important to take into account that these drugs pivotal in the treatment of many autoimmune patients are already running out in fact shortages are being reported from several european countries ie iv tocilizumab and hiq autoimmune patients under immunosuppressive drugs could be prone to sars-cov-2 infection however suspension of the ongoing conventional and biological therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares and the consequent increase in the infection riskin late 2019 a novel corona virus sars-cov-2 caused an outbreak of a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan china the new 2019 coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 has continued to spread rapidly around the world and has since become a global health emergency although control and quarantine measures have been applied to prevent a global spread the infection has gradually increased resulting in a pandemic 1 as of april 22 2020 a total of 2528330 covid-19 cases and 177198 fatal cases were reported worldwide with 84287 cases and 4642 deaths reported in china alone moreover the number of people infected with covid-19 in the united states accounts for about one-third of the world with a 55 mortality ratesars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family along with sars-cov and mers-cov but its transmission speed and infectivity are stronger than both 2 3 sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through the respiratory tract mainly causing respiratory infections and developing severe pneumonia respiratory failure and even death in infected patients 4 5 although the current situation is very grim there is no specific medicine available for sars-cov-2 a recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the covid-19-related mortality rate varies widely among epicenters and counties even at the global level 6 in addition researchers have identified several clinical characteristics associated with an increased risk of developing severe covid-19 such as hypertension cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease and diabetes 6 considering that infections might progress rapidly in some patients and timely clinical decisions are required identifying patients who are at risk of developing a serious disease is particularly important for healthcare workerssince the pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for sars-cov-2 has not been completely explained information about inflammation and the immune response of patients with different severity of covid-19 remains insufficient inflammation accompanied by an immune response often occurs in viral respiratory infections and increasing evidence supports its important role in the progression of covid-19 7 moreover a previous retrospective study reported that a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 could have a dysregulation of the immune response that allows the development of viral hyperinflammation 8 in view of the fact that inflammation or immune indicators are very common and easily obtained identifying risk factors in blood associated with disease severity among sars-cov-2-infected patients is vital for early intervention to improve mortalityhowever to date no systematic review has been reported concerning the putative association between various inflammation indicators and the progression of covid-19 therefore in the current study a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the difference of several inflammation indicators between severe and non-severe covid-19 patients and identify the relevant risk factors correlated with the progression of covid-19the pubmed web of science embase and china national knowledge internet cnki databases were searched for eligible publications from december 2019 to april 2020 the search strategy was based on combination of following terms covid-19 or novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia or 2019 novel coronavirus or ncp or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 the search items in each database are also available in supplementary material references cited in the retrieved articles were also scanned for relevant studies two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract of each study articles deemed potentially eligible were retrieved for a full-text reviewthis systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the prisma guidelines studies included in the meta-analysis had to satisfy the following criteria 1 the study was a clinical observation in humans 2 the study included clinical signs of a covid-19 patient and 3 the study included baseline information regarding inflammation indicators such as white blood cells neutrophils lymphocytes c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin pct all articles of any design randomized controlled trials non-randomized controlled trials case-control studies and cross-sectional studies were included except for narrative review comment opinion piece methodological report or conference abstractdata were extracted separately by two reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by consensus the following data of each study were extracted from included articles name of first author publication date study location sample size patients age gender study design covid-19 severity and inflammation indicators the quality of the included studies was assessed using the minors 9 by two independent reviewers minors is a valid instrument designed to assess the methodological quality of non-randomized surgical studies whether comparative or non-comparative the global ideal score is 16 for non-comparative studies and 24 for comparative studiesmeta-analyses were conducted in order to evaluate the association between inflammation indicators and the risk of developing severe covid-19 10 for studies that presented continuous data as medians and inter-quartile ranges the estimate of the means and standard deviations was performed according to the method described by wan et al 11 the mean difference mdwmd or the standardized mean difference smd and their related 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated to evaluate the discrepancy of indicators between the non-severe and severe covid-19 groups for the pooled analysis of the relationship between indicators and the severity of covid-19 odds ratio or and related 95 ci were pooled to calculate the effective valuethe review manager version 53 and stata software version 120 were used for data analysis the heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the chi-squared and i-squared tests with values of 025 25175 and 751100 indicating a low moderate and high degree of heterogeneity respectively if i2  50 a random-effect model was used to calculate the effect value otherwise a fixed-effect model was performed all p-values were two-tailed with a significant level at 005 publication bias number of studies 10 was evaluated using beggs funnel plots and beggs rank correlation test and the significance was set to p  005in the initial search 10456 potentially relevant records were found in the pubmed web of science embase and cnki databases figure 1 all papers were screened by reading their titles and 1704 of them were excluded due to being duplicates found in different databases after evaluating the abstracts 8441 studies were eliminated due to presenting data that were irrelevant to our aim after carefully reading the full text of the remaining 311 studies 282 papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria were further excluded finally 29 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in qualitative synthesis but some indicators were not described in all articlesa total of 29 studies 8 1138 published between feb 2020 and apr 2020 were identified and all these studies were retrospective cohort studies of a design with 4911 patients enrolled in this meta-analysis the main characteristics of the included studies are summarized and presented in table 1 eleven studies were conducted in wuhan city the epicenter of covid-19 outbreak only one study was national it was the largest and included 1099 covid-19 patients the other 17 studies were accomplished in several cities of china outside wuhan all patients in selected studies were diagnosis and confirmed as covid-19 sample sizes of all studies ranged from 41 to 1099 the extracted inflammation or immune indicator comprises white blood cell neutrophil lymphocyte monocyte t cell helper t cell cytotoxic t cell erythrocyte sedimentation rate interleukin-6 neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio c-reactive protein and procalcitonin in addition none of the studies were considered to be seriously flawed according to the minors assessment the 29 included studies scored between 18 and 21there is little information about the underlying mechanisms of severe covid-19 development and further investigations are urgently needed qin et al 8 previously suggested that covid-19 might damage lymphocytes especially t lymphocytes and the immune system was impaired during the period of disease also several studies discovered an increased level of neutrophils along with a decrease in lymphocyte numbers in patients with covid-19 13 16 29 these findings indicated that neutrophils or lymphocytes could be a potential risk factor for the progression of sars-cov-2-infected patients to test this we conducted a meta-analysis in order to investigate whether lymphocytes or other immune cells were significantly associated with increased disease severity of covid-19 table 2information on white blood cell wbc was available in 25 studies including 4278 patients with covid-19 the test showed that these studies have certain heterogeneity i2  77 p  0001 and the random effect model was used the estimated pooled md for these studies revealed a significant increase in number of wbc in severe covid-19 group md  083 95 ci 041125 p  0001 figure 2a in addition our analysis revealed that compared to covid-19 patients with normal levels of wbc covid-19 patients who presented with an increased number of wbc 10  109l had an 3-fold higher risk of developing severe disease with a combined odds ratio or of 292 95 ci 196435 p  0001 figure 2b eight studies were considered to be homogeneous and the fixed effect model was used i2  0 p  047 therefore we suggest that covid-19 patients who present with an abnormal wbc count should be carefully monitored and managed according to these resultsneutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell in the human body numbering an average of 4150 cellsl 5070 of the total number of wbc information on neutrophils was available in 18 studies including 758 cases in the severe group and 1688 cases in non-severe group since heterogeneity i2  69 exceeded 50 a random effects model was adopted similarly we observed a significant increase in number of neutrophils in severe covid-19 group md  150 95 ci 101198 p  0001 table 2lymphocytes are an important cellular component of the bodys immune response function the main performer of almost all immune functions of the lymphatic system and a frontline soldier to fight external infections and monitor cell mutations in the body we obtained information about lymphocytes in 27 studies including 4480 cases the pooled analysis revealed that the number of lymphocytes decreased in patients with severe disease compared with non-severe patients md  036 95 ci from 043 to 030 p  0001 figure 3a next we performed a meta-analysis in order to examine the association between lymphopenia 1  109l and disease severity in patients with covid-19 we found that pronounced lymphopenia was strongly associated with increased disease severity or  497 95 ci 353699 p  0001 figure 3b with moderate heterogeneity i2  39 p  012 regarding the changes of several lymphocyte subtypes between severe and non-severe covid-19 patients we found that the number of total t cells helper t cells and cytotoxic t cells decreased as the disease progresses table 2 however our meta-analysis revealed no significant correlation between monocyte and severe covid-19 md  001 95 ci 003001 p  028 table 2the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio nlr derived from the absolute neutrophil and absolute lymphocyte counts of a full blood count is an potential marker of the systemic inflammatory response 40 a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count indicate the intensity of the inflammatory response and damage to the immune system respectively in this study we also observed a significant increase in the number of neutrophils and a significant decrease in the lymphocyte count during the severe phase therefore higher nlr could be a potential maker for predicting the disease progression we obtained information about nlr in six studies including 1141 cases the estimated pooled md for these six studies indicated that severe patients have a higher nlr than non-severe patients md  085 95 ci 056115 p  0001 figure 4a at the same time elevated nlr was significantly associated with increased disease severity with the pooled or being 250 95 ci 204306 p  0001 figure 4b demonstrating that elevated nlr could be a predictor of disease progression in covid-19 patientsprocalcitonin pct used as a marker of severe inflammation is released during infections caused by bacteria fungi and parasites but is normal or only slightly elevated in viral infections 41 in this meta-analysis we obtained information about pct in 16 studies including 2070 cases the estimated pooled md for these studies revealed a significant increase in pct smd  078 95 ci 034122 p  0001 figure 5a the pooled analysis showed a high degree of heterogeneity in pct levels i2  93 p  0001 then we performed another meta-analysis in order to examine the putative association between elevated pct 05 ngml and covid-19 severity as shown in figure 5b our results revealed that patients who present with elevated pct have a significantly increased risk of developing severe covid-19 or  633 95 ci 3971010 p  0001 with low study heterogeneity i2  0 p  070c-reactive protein crp is an acute-phase response protein synthesized by the liver and elevated in response to inflammatory diseases it plays a vital role in protection against infection prevention of autoimmunity and regulation of the inflammatory response information on crp was available in 20 studies including 2591 patients with covid-19 the estimated pooled md indicated that severe patients have a higher level of crp than non-severe patients md  4102 95 ci 33324871 p  0001 figure 6a with moderate study heterogeneity i2  73 moreover we found that elevated crp above normal range was significantly correlated with increased disease severity in covid-19 or  351 95 ci 238516 p  0001 figure 6b with moderate heterogeneity i2  49 p  008 regarding other major inflammation-related markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and interleukin-6 il-6 we found that esr and il-6 were both significantly associated with increased disease severity table 3publication bias was originally defined as the publication or non-publication of studies depending on the direction and statistical significance of the results publication bias was examined by the funnel plot and beggs rank correlation test as shown in figure 7 distribution of the funnel plot was nearly symmetric and no evidence of publication bias in lymphocyte p  0967 and pct p  0964 however it was asymmetric in the meta-analyses of wbc neutrophil and crp therefore the trim and fill method was adopted to adjust publication bias 42 after adjustment distribution of the funnel plot was more symmetric than before figure 7 at the same time we found that the adjusted pooled md did not change significantly which indicated that the publication bias had little impact on the analysis and the analysis results were relatively stable figures s1s3the majority of covid-19 patients have relatively mild symptoms but a considerable number of patients progress to severe pneumonia and even eventually develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock andor multiple organ failure 2 therefore it is of great significance to study the immunological characteristics of peripheral blood in severe patients for timely diagnosis precise treatment delaying or halting the progression of the disease and reducing mortalityas is well-known viral infection is closely related to the human immune system good immune function can help the body eliminate foreign microorganisms control infection and eventually restore health 43 dysregulation of immune cell responses and consequently immunologic abnormality are thought to play important roles in the severity of virus-induced disease 44 indeed previous studies of novel coronavirus infection have suggested that the severe and aberrant host immune response are responsible for the severity of covid-19 16 24 at the same time peripheral blood immune-inflammatory parameters will also change significantly with the progression of covid-19 disease therefore emerging researches were focus on these accessible laboratory data for assessing and predicting clinical severity in patients with covid-19 one of the most prominent factors related to the severity and outcomes of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov disease is the hematological change in the white blood cell population 45 also several studies have addressed the difference of baseline leukocyte counts between the clinical stages in covid-19 patients mo et al 46 reported that refractory patients had higher level of neutrophils in comparison with general patients in patients with severe covid-19 but not in patients with mild disease lymphopenia is a common feature with drastically reduced numbers of cd4t cells cd8 t cells b cells and natural killer nk cells 2 8 13 qin et al 8 investigated 452 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 and found that severe cases were likely to have higher neutrophil count but lower lymphocyte count compared with non-severe patients the nlr thus tended to be higher in the severe group long et al 19 reported that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio 2973 hr  264 95 ci 142491 p  0002 was an independent risk factor for progression of covid-19 by multivariate cox regression analyses moreover some studies showed that higher levels of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and nlr were correlated with the severity of the disease 13 47 zhu et al 48 demonstrated that high level of il-6 and crp were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of covid-19this meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association between immune-inflammatory parameters and increased disease severity in covid-19 patients in the present study we firstly utilized the available data from 25 included studies with a total of 4278 patients to obtain the pooled results to evaluate the difference in wbc count between a severe and non-severe group we found that the white blood cell counts of severe patients tended to be higher than that of less severe patients next the effect of wbc count on the risk of developing severe covid-19 was further examined the pooled results statistically supported the conclusions that elevated wbc count was strongly associated with the deterioration of disease in covid-19 patients or  292 95 ci 196435 p  0001 similarly the number of neutrophils was found to be higher in severe covid-19 md  150 95 ci 101198 p  0001 however patients with serious disease tend to have a reduced total lymphocyte count as well as virous lymphocyte subtypes count compared to non-severe covid-19 patients in addition covid-19 patients who presented with lymphopenia had an 5-fold higher risk of developing severe disease or  497 95 ci 353699 p  0001 consistent with previous reports this meta-analysis also indicated that the incidence of high nlr had significant association with illness severity md  085 95 ci 056115 p  0001 and elevated nlr could act as a predictor for exacerbation of covid-19 or  250 95 ci 204306 p  0001 moreover other common immune-inflammatory parameters such as pct and crp could also predict the deterioration of disease pct or  633 95 ci 3971010 p  0001 crp or  351 95 ci 238516 p  0001 in this study esr and il-6 were also found to be correlated with increased disease severity in covid-19 patientssars-cov-2 infection can activate innate and adaptive immune responses a rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infections while uncontrolled inflammatory innate responses and impaired adaptive immune responses may lead to harmful tissue damage both locally and systemically 49 taking both the levels of neutrophil and lymphocyte into account nlr may be a better biomarker for systemic inflammation and illness severity than single neutrophil or lymphocyte count in this study we confirmed that an increase in nlr usually indicated higher disease severity with more clinical evidence the following reasons may explain the finding on one hand most patients with severe covid-19 exhibit substantially elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines meanwhile neutrophils can be triggered by virus-related inflammatory factors produced by lymphocyte and endothelial cells such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte colony stimulating factor and interferon-gamma 50 the triggered neutrophils produce reactive oxygen species ros and other cytotoxic mediators which may dampen the virus infection 51 moreover neutrophils are able to release neutrophil extracellular traps nets which are a sticky web of dna conjugated with antimicrobial enzymes such as myeloperoxidase and histones resulting in the capture and the killing of different pathogens including viruses 5254 on the other hand lymphocytes did not show a significant decrease in the early stage of viral infection but significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients 34 the main reasons for the decrease or exhaustion of lymphocyte in severe cases may be the following viruses attack target cells and directly damage cells viral infection causes immune cells to enter an activated state and participate in the anti-viral process resulting in severe damage and apoptosis systematic inflammation stimulates the production of neutrophil and speed up the apoptosis of lymphocyte severe covid-19 patients tend to present an increase of pct and crp indicating a potential bacterial co-infection and bacterial co-infection or superinfection might affect the immune responsealthough the sample size of this study is large 4911 covid-19 cases from 29 clinical studies enrolled some limitations should be noted meanwhile firstly the primary research design of the studies included in this study were retrospective cohorts with insufficient demonstration ability limiting their ability to infer definitive causality secondly all included original clinical cohort studies were conducted in china which limits the ability of this study to extrapolate other patient populations in other countries thirdly the high statistic heterogeneity could be found in calculating pooled md which may relate to large variation among studies in the sample sizein summary we came to the cautious conclusion that immune-inflammatory parameters such as wbc lymphocyte nlr pct and crp were correlated with disease severity and could be used as potentially important risk factors for disease progression in addition increased nlr levels reflecting an enhanced inflammatory process may also suggest a poor prognosis therefore surveillance of immune-inflammatory parameters especially nlr may be helpful in the diagnosis early screening and predicting of severe illness and

conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 likely occurred from a zoonotic transmission in china in december 2019 linked to a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals the causative virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is capable of human-to-human transmission and spread rapidly to other parts of china and then to other locations by 24 march 2020 sars-cov-2 had infected more than 381000 people across 195 countriesregions and killed more than 16000 a pandemic as declared by the world health organization1 daily reports of sharp rises in the number of new cases continue to emerge from many countriesregions but efforts to overcome the virus are hampered by a lack of knowledge of several important aspects of sars-cov-2 infection ranging from pathogen biology to host response and treatment options therefore there is an urgent need to better understand the hostpathogen biology of covid-19 as this will offer important insights into treatment and management of the disease including identification of new therapies here we review the literature on sars-cov-2 pathophysiology its interaction with target cells and the immune response to the virus including the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression specifically we highlight the implications of specific features of the infection for promising therapeutic interventions that could target the virus or the dysfunctional immune response moreover we discuss how studies focused on the adaptive immune response will be crucial in informing the development of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodiescoronaviruses are known to cause disease in humans and animals among these four human coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 typically infect only the upper respiratory tract and cause relatively minor symptoms2 however there are three coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 that can replicate in the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia which can be fatal sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus its closest relative among human coronaviruses is sars-cov with 79 genetic similarity3 however among all known coronavirus sequences sars-cov-2 is most similar to bat coronavirus ratg13 with 98 similarity4 and coronavirus sequences in the pangolin a scaly anteater also share high similarity5like the other respiratory coronaviruses sars-cov-2 is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets with a possible but unproven faecaloral transmission route on infection the median incubation period is approximately 45 days before symptom onset69 with 975 of symptomatic patients developing symptoms within 115 days8 at the point of hospital admission patients with covid-19 typically exhibit a fever and dry cough less commonly patients also experience difficulty in breathing muscle andor joint pain headachedizziness diarrhoea nausea and the coughing up of blood61015 within 56 days of symptom onset sars-cov-2 viral load reaches its peak  significantly earlier than that of the related sars-cov where viral load peaks at about 10 days after symptom onset1619 severe covid-19 cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards on average around 89 days after symptom onset1120the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 infection closely resembles that of sars-cov infection with aggressive inflammatory responses strongly implicated in the resulting damage to the airways21 therefore disease severity in patients is due to not only the viral infection but also the host response the pattern of increasing severity with age is also broadly consistent with the epidemiology of sars-cov and mers-cov61114ards seen in severe covid-19 is characterized by difficulty in breathing and low blood oxygen level22 as a result some patients may succumb to secondary bacterial and fungal infections14 ards may lead directly to respiratory failure which is the cause of death in 70 of fatal covid-19 cases22 in addition the vast release of cytokines by the immune system in response to the viral infection andor secondary infections can result in a cytokine storm and symptoms of sepsis that are the cause of death in 28 of fatal covid-19 cases22 in these cases uncontrolled inflammation inflicts multi-organ damage leading to organ failure especially of the cardiac hepatic and renal systems fig 1 most patients with sars-cov infection who progressed to renal failure eventually died23the first step in infection is virus binding to a host cell through its target receptor earlier work on sars-cov demonstrated that this virus principally targets airway epithelial cells alveolar epithelial cells vascular endothelial cells and macrophages in the lung all of which express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 host target receptor used by sars-cov2426 fig 2 as sars-cov-2 uses the same entry receptor these cell subsets are likely targeted by this virus42728 sars-cov infection reduces ace2 expression in lung cells because loss of pulmonary ace2 function is associated with acute lung injury virus-induced ace2 downregulation may be important for disease pathology2932 ace2 has been shown to regulate the reninangiotensin system ras32 therefore a reduction in ace2 function after viral infection could result in a dysfunction of the ras which influences blood pressure and fluidelectrolyte balance and enhance inflammation and vascular permeability in the airwayscovid-19 shows a difference in fatality rate between males 28 and females 1733 as ace2 is located on the x chromosome there may be alleles that confer resistance to covid-19 explaining the lower fatality rate in females alternatively the oestrogen and testosterone sex hormones have different immunoregulatory functions which could influence immune protection or disease severity34sars-cov-2 shares 79 genome sequence identity with sars-cov4 the spike s protein is expressed on the surface of the virus particles giving the characteristic crown appearance the s protein comprises two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit consists of an amino-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain rbd which in sars-cov spans from amino acid residue 318 to amino acid residue 510 refs3537 the rbd binds to ace2 as its host cell target receptor which starts the infection process4 rbd binding to ace2 triggers endocytosis of the sars-cov-2 virion and exposes it to endosomal proteases38 the s2 subunit consists of a fusion peptide fp region and two heptad repeat regions hr1 and hr2 refs3940 within the endosome the s1 subunit is cleaved away exposing the fusion peptide which inserts into the host membrane the s2 region then folds in on itself to bring the hr1 and hr2 regions together this leads to membrane fusion and releases the viral package into the host cytoplasmthere is 72 similarity in the amino acid sequence of the rbds of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with highly similar tertiary structures computational modelling and biophysical measurements indicate that the sars-cov-2 rbd binds to ace2 with higher affinity than that of sars-cov4142 in addition the sars-cov-2 s protein contains a furin-like cleavage site similarly to mers-cov and human coronavirus oc43 which is not found in sars-cov43 these characteristics could contribute to the increased infectivity of sars-cov-2 relative to sars-cov in addition to furin precleavage the cellular serine protease tmprss2 is also required to properly process the sars-cov-2 spike protein and facilitate host cell entry44one pathway for the development of therapeutics against sars-cov-2 is to block the host target ace2 receptor or tmprss2 fig 3 currently there are compounds that target these molecules that have been clinically approved for other indications for example machine learning algorithms predicted that baricitinib a janus kinase jak inhibitor approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis could inhibit ace2-mediated endocytosis45 another jak inhibitor ruxolitinib will be tested in clinical trials for treatment of covid-19 later this year46 an alternative strategy is to deliver high concentrations of a soluble form of ace2 that could potentially reduce virus entry into target host cells this principle is being tested with apn01 a recombinant form of ace2 developed by apeiron that is currently in clinical trials47 monoclonal antibodies targeting the s protein may also inhibit virus entry or fusion and are further discussed in the section entitled b cell immunity nafamostat mesylate4849 and camostat mesylate44 are known inhibitors of tmprss2 and are currently approved in several countriesregions to treat other conditions while there are no clinical trials specifically testing these drugs against covid-19 at the time of writing when camostat mesylate was tested on sars-cov-2 isolated from a patient it prevented entry of the virus into lung cells4450 if this approach is validated rapid repurposing of these drugs will be effective and timely in the fight against covid-19sars-cov-2 infection and the destruction of lung cells triggers a local immune response recruiting macrophages and monocytes that respond to the infection release cytokines and prime adaptive t and b cell immune responses in most cases this process is capable of resolving the infection however in some cases a dysfunctional immune response occurs which can cause severe lung and even systemic pathologycytopathic viruses including sars-cov-2 ref51 induce death and injury of virus-infected cells and tissues as part of the virus replicative cycle viral infection and replication in airway epithelial cells52 could cause high levels of virus-linked pyroptosis with associated vascular leakage as seen in patients with sars-cov53 pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is commonly seen with cytopathic viruses54 this is a likely trigger for the subsequent inflammatory response55 il-1 an important cytokine released during pyroptosis is elevated during sars-cov-2 infection11 using a variety of pattern-recognition receptors prrs alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages detect the released pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps such as viral rna and damage-associated molecular patterns damps including atp dna and asc oligomers a wave of local inflammation ensues involving increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines il-6 ifn mcp1 and ip-10 into the blood of afflicted patients1122 these cytokines are indicators of a t helper 1 th1 cell-polarized response which parallels observations made for sars-cov and mers-cov56 secretion of such cytokines and chemokines attracts immune cells notably monocytes and t lymphocytes but not neutrophils from the blood into the infected site5758 pulmonary recruitment of immune cells from the blood and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the airways may explain the lymphopenia and increased neutrophillymphocyte ratio seen in around 80 of patients with sars-cov-2 infection659in most individuals recruited cells clear the infection in the lung the immune response recedes and patients recover however in some patients a dysfunctional immune response occurs which triggers a cytokine storm that mediates widespread lung inflammation it was observed that patients with severe covid-19 requiring intensive care in hospitals exhibited higher blood plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf ip-10 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 mip1 and tumour necrosis factor tnf11 il-6 levels in these patients continue to increase over time and are relatively more elevated in non-survivors than survivors60 notably there exists a highly inflammatory monocyte-derived fcn1 macrophage population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe but not mild covid-19 ref61 also patients with severe disease show a significantly higher percentage of cd14cd16 inflammatory monocytes in peripheral blood than patients with mild disease62 these cells secrete inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the cytokine storm including mcp1 ip-10 and mip1 fig 1the mechanisms by which sars-cov-2 subverts the bodys innate antiviral cytokine responses are yet to be studied but research on sars-cov shows that multiple viral structural and non-structural proteins antagonize interferon responses antagonism occurs at various stages of the interferon signalling pathway including by preventing prr recognition of viral rna6365 by preventing prr signalling through tbk1inhibitor of nuclear factor-b kinase subunit- ikk traf3 and irf3 refs6366 by preventing downstream interferon signalling through stat1 ref67 and by promoting host mrna degradation and inhibiting host protein translation68 it is very likely that at least some of these pathways are conserved in sars-cov-2 antagonism of the interferon response aids viral replication resulting in increased release of pyroptosis products that can further induce aberrant inflammatory responsesunrestrained inflammatory cell infiltration can itself mediate damage in the lung through excessive secretion of proteases and reactive oxygen species in addition to the direct damage resulting from the virus together these result in diffuse alveolar damage including desquamation of alveolar cells hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary oedema5758 this limits the efficiency of gas exchange in the lung causing difficulty in breathing and low blood oxygen levels the lung also becomes more vulnerable to secondary infectionsin addition to local damage cytokine storm also has ripple effects across the body elevated levels of cytokines such as tnf can cause septic shock and multi-organ failure these may result in myocardial damage and circulatory failure observed in some patients69 older people those aged over 60 years and people with co-morbidities are more likely to develop such a dysfunctional immune response that causes pathology and also fails to successfully eradicate the pathogen the exact reasons for this are unclear although one reason may be an ageing lung microenvironment causing altered dendritic cell maturation and migration to the lymphoid organs70 and thereby defective t cell activation in contrast children tend not to develop severe disease despite being capable of experiencing high viral titres71 across all age groups younger than 18 years more than 50 of children experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic with less than 6 of children developing severe symptoms72 thus while the aforementioned studies represent important inroads a full picture of the critical host immune factors that underlie the development of severer inflammatory responses in some patients remains poorly definedit remains controversial whether virus persistence is necessary to drive the ongoing damage the peak of viral titres in respiratory tract samples might occur even before symptom onset of pneumonia in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections1719 however a large retrospective cohort study showed that viral rna was detectable in non-survivors up until the point of death suggesting a correlation between virus persistence and poor disease outcome60 as viral rna may linger even after active infection and is not representative of the infectivity of the virus whether the poor disease outcome is directly due to large amounts of infectious particles is speculative at this moment furthermore earlier studies of sars-cov found that the virus may infect other targets besides lung cells notably virus was found in t lymphocytes73 macrophages7476 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells77 direct virus killing of lymphocytes could contribute to the observed lymphopenia in patients73 viral infection in immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages can result in aberrant cytokine production even if viral infection is not productive7477 the degree to which sars-cov-2 targets these cells remains poorly defined understanding the precise drivers of immune dysfunction is crucial to guide the application of appropriate immunomodulatory treatmentsseveral immunosuppressive therapies aimed at limiting immunomediated damage in covid-19 are at various phases of development and are listed in table 1 currently trials of corticosteroids for treatment of covid-19 are under way78 although this class of treatment was not recommended during the 2003 sars epidemic7980 a clinical trial of the il-6 antagonist tocilizumab is also under way to test its efficacy81 and sarilumab is also being explored82 other clinical trials are also testing the effects of targeting granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf including the use of gimsilumab83 lenzilumab84 and namilumab85 another novel adjunctive therapy is cytosorb86 which acts by absorbing a broad spectrum of cytokines damps and pamps in order to reduce their circulating levels and ameliorate immunopathology thalidomide an agent with immunomodulatory properties has also been successfully administered to a single patient with covid-19 ref87 as a result two clinical trials have now been initiated to test its potential to reduce lung injury8889 tnf antagonism was suggested but not tested in the context of sars-cov infection and it has not yet been tested in patients with covid-19 ref90 a small open-label non-randomized study suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine a known antimalarial agent and azithromycin a common antibiotic may be beneficial for treating patients with severe covid-19 ref91 although hydroxychloroquines effect on direct inhibition of the virus92 and its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities are known93 whether these mechanisms play a role against covid-19 remains to be determined94both t and b cell responses against sars-cov-2 are detected in the blood around 1 week after the onset of covid-19 symptoms cd8 t cells are important for directly attacking and killing virus-infected cells whereas cd4 t cells are crucial to prime both cd8 t cells and b cells cd4 t cells are also responsible for cytokine production to drive immune cell recruitment the first autopsy of a patient with covid-19 revealed an accumulation of mononuclear cells likely monocytes and t cells in the lungs coupled with low levels of hyperactive t cells in the peripheral blood57 together with reports of lymphopenia and reduced peripheral t cell levels in patients 69597 these findings suggest that t cells are attracted away from the blood and into the infected site to control the viral infection in patients with covid-19 increased t cell exhaustion and reduced functional diversity predicted severe disease98 despite the impaired response patients who recovered from sars-cov infection developed coronavirus-specific memory t cells which were found up to 2 years after recovery99100sars-cov-specific cd4 t cells express ifn tnf and il-2 which suggests that patients with sars-cov infection exhibit a th1 cell response and mainly use cellular immunity to control the infection101102 although this pro-inflammatory profile may be an aggravating factor for immunopathogenesis cd4 t cells have been hypothesized to control sars as depletion of these cells in mice resulted in slower clearance of the virus from the host and severer lung inflammation103 with the use of a mouse-adapted strain of sars-cov immunization with dendritic cells bearing sars-cov peptides resulted in higher numbers of virus-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells that accumulated in the lungs and increased survival104105 also transfer of sars-cov-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in better protection against a mouse-adapted strain of sars-cov105despite evidence for an important role of t cells in controlling infection several vaccine formulations against sars-cov previously tested in animal models showed signs of immunopathology associated with th2 cell-mediated eosinophil infiltration106107 in particular aged mice that were vaccinated seemed to display increased immunopathology rather than protection108 further study of the nature of protective versus detrimental t cell responses is critically needed to determine the optimal t cell engagement strategies for vaccines109coronavirus-specific t cells are clearly important in eliminating the virus and controlling disease development and should be considered in vaccine strategies however whether t cell responses alone are capable of preventing infection in human settings remains to be investigated this knowledge will be important for vaccine developmentb cell responses in patients with covid-19 occur concomitantly with t follicular helper cell responses from around 1 week after symptom onset110 in patients with sars-cov infection b cell responses typically arise first against the nucleocapsid n protein within 48 days after symptom onset antibody responses to s protein are found111112 neutralizing antibody responses likely to the s protein begin to develop by week 2 and most patients develop neutralizing antibodies by week 3 refs113114 given that viral titres peak earlier for sars-cov-2 than for sars-cov1619 antibody responses may also arise earlier it seems that a subset of patients may not develop long-lasting antibodies to sars-cov-2 ref115 it remains unknown whether these patients are susceptible to reinfection of which there are sporadic reports116117 antibodies are likely to be effective against sars-cov-2 convalescent serum samples have been applied with apparently good clinical results in covid-19 ref118 and were also previously used successfully in the treatment of sars119121while mechanistic correlates of protection have not yet been identified in humans neutralization of the virus is presumed to be an important mechanism of action for antibodies although the specific titre and specificity of the antibody repertoire required for protection remain undefined in sars-cov the primary target of neutralizing antibodies is the rbd122 comprising a 193 amino acid region amino acids 318510 in the s protein which can independently bind to the host target ace2 receptor3537 although a few previously identified monoclonal antibodies to sars-cov also bind to or neutralize sars-cov-2 ref123 the majority do not124 this could be due to significant differences in the rbds of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 4 in particular of the 33 amino acids in the region amino acids 460492 in the sars-cov s protein that contains the critical residues that contact ace2 ref125 less than half 1533 are conserved in sars-cov-2 nevertheless mouse antiserum raised against sars-cov protein can cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 pseudovirus indicating overlapping neutralizing epitopes between the two viruses28126in china hospitals have initiated the use of convalescent plasma as a source of therapeutic polyclonal antibodies for treatment of covid-19 and early data suggest a positive impact on respiratory viral load and mortality127128 efforts are under way to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to sars-cov-2 using approaches including phage library display traditional mouse immunization and hybridoma isolation and cloning of b cell sequences from convalescent human patients129132 sars-cov does not appear to have strong mechanisms to escape or prevent antibody neutralization such as glycan shielding of the receptor-binding site against antibody binding133 this is further corroborated by the fact that patients with sars-cov infection were generally capable of developing neutralizing antibodies a recombinant s protein fragment that included the rbd of sars-cov showed the highest immunogenicity relative to other recombinant s protein fragments tested suggesting that the immune system is capable of targeting neutralizing epitopes effectively134 thus if sars-cov-2 behaves like sars-cov in this respect it is likely that these efforts will be successful in developing neutralizing monoclonal antibodiesit is possible that alterations in the s protein will render sars-cov-2 resistant to some monoclonal antibodies especially as it spreads and mutates as of now the entire rbd remains conserved and there are only four known rare non-synonymous alterations in the s protein v483a l455i f456v and g476s135 the v483a alteration maps to a similar natural alteration found in mers-cov i529t where it reduced viral protein binding to the host receptor target and also increased resistance to antibody neutralization from serum samples from patients with mers136 f456v and g476s alterations also map to similar alteration positions in sars-cov l443r and d463g which were found in a panel of neutralization escape mutants137however the selection of therapeutic antibody candidates should include careful consideration of potential unwanted side effects for example pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses may exacerbate sars-cov infections through antibody-dependent enhancement138140 also previous studies in animal models showed that in sars-cov infection neutralizing antibodies to s protein can potentially augment severe lung injury by exacerbating inflammatory responses141 in addition a correlation has been observed where development of ards coincides with antiviral igg seroconversion in 80 of patients19 patients who developed neutralizing antibodies to s protein earlier in infection had a higher rate of disease it took an average of only 147 days for patients who died of infection to reach their peak levels of neutralizing antibody activity as opposed to 20 days for patients who went on to recover142 similarly for mers patients with severer disease appear to have higher antibody titres than those with mild disease143144 although one study argues that it is a delay in the development of antibody responses that is associated with disease145 the binding of antibodyvirus immune complexes to activating fc receptors on alveolar macrophages could induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors including il-8 and mcp1 which add to the immunostimulatory milieu146 such complexes may also activate the complement system and lead to further unwanted inflammation141 as a result it is important to consider engineering therapeutic antibodies with little or no pro-inflammatory activity but that retain their virus-neutralizing capacity147 for instance alterations could be made to the fc region andor its glycosylation to change its binding affinity for activating fc receptors146148this review has presented the various mechanisms of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 immunopathogenesis controlling the inflammatory response may be as important as targeting the virus therapies inhibiting viral infection and regulation of dysfunctional immune responses may synergize to block pathologies at multiple steps at the same time the association between immune dysfunction and outcome of disease severity in patients with covid-19 should serve as a note of caution in vaccine development and evaluation further studies of the host immune response to sars-cov-2 are necessary including a detailed investigation of the determinants of healthy versus dysfunctional outcomes these will also help identify biomarkers to define immune correlates of protection and disease severity for effective triage of patientsfacing a lack of a specific treatment against the lethal covid-19 pandemic its rapid advance and taking into account that an adequate immune response is crucial to overcome this viral infection the need arises to explore pharmacological existing and known agents that reinforce or enhance the immune system activity the physiopathology of covid-19 infection and the main cause of death in patients infected with this virus consist of an exacerbated inflammation with infiltration of immune cells necrosis and hyperplasia of affected tissue especially in the lung level this results in impaired pulmonary oxygen exchange causing severe pneumonia 1 2 3 some systemic alterations also are observed mainly in patients over 60 years which include disturbance of normal plasma levels of lymphocytes thrombocytes c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme 4 of particular interest is that older adults are at a higher risk of death 5angiotensin ii plasma levels were found significantly elevated in infected patients and were directly proportional to the viral load and lung damage observed 6 hence there are close connections between covid-19 and renin-angiotensin system ras it has been shown that covid-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors ace2r to invade human lung epithelial cells and to initiate the infection at the same time ace2 produces anti-inflammatory antioxidant anti-fibrotic and anti-hyperplasia effects since cause the degradation of angiotensin ii ang ii at lung level by ace2ang1-7mas receptor signaling pathway the counter-regulatory ras axis with actions opposite to classical ras axis aceang iiat1 receptor pathway the increase in the degradation of ang ii prevents its toxic over-accumulation which would provoke the acute respiratory distress syndrome often present in covid-19 infection therefore ace2 has an antagonistic dual action in this viral infection also the expression of ace2 is lower in males than in females and also lower in older adults than in young people which could influence the susceptibility of elderly males to death by covid-19 infection 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 to highlight this group of patients has a worse prognosis when they are associated in addition to the elderly condition with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes hypertension and obesity all of them with stimulated rasit has also been reported that ras is involved in the regulation of proliferation inflammation and fibrosis of lung tissues in several pulmonary pathologies independently of covid-19 infection such as acute lung injury asthma pulmonary arterial hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis among others 14 in this context it is known that vitamin d and its metabolites enhance immunity to a great variety of respiratory pathogens in vitro moreover many clinical trials have been demonstrated a strong association between vitamin d deficiency and increased risk of developing respiratory infections and that its supplementation reduces the events related to respiratory tract infections 15 16 17 18 other clinical trial results showed that vitamin d supplementation markedly reduces the rate of moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary cop disease exacerbations in patients with basal 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels lower than 25 nmoll but not in patients with higher levels 19 it was observed that vitamin d decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections by three main mechanisms the maintenance of tight junctions to prevent the infiltration of immune cells in lungs and other respiratory tissues the kill of some viruses through the stimulation of antiviral mechanisms and the reduction in synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the modulation of the immune system avoiding the development of pneumonia 20 in this sense it is known that vitamin d metabolites modulate the secretion and expression of several chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as type 1 interferon ifn-1 cxcl8 cxcl10 tnf-alfa and il-6 in different viral infections 21the antiviral effects of vitamin d through the modulation of the immune system have also been recently suggested in fact vitamin d deficiency may be associated with a higher risk of getting influenza other respiratory viral infections dengue hepatitis herpesvirus and even human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection in cell culture studies vitamin d has antiviral efficacy especially facing enveloped viruses therefore it would be effective against covid-19 although the antiviral mechanisms of vitamin d have not been completely established they may be related to the ability of vitamin d to up-regulate the anti-microbial peptides human beta-defensin 2 and ll-37 cathelicidin 2223 also the evidence shows that melatonin influences both directly and indirectly the immune system state 24 simultaneously melatonin has also been suggested as an antiviral hormone the effects are exerted through different mechanisms related to melatonins anti-oxidation immunomodulation and anti-inflammation actions 25 a recent study proposed the use of melatonin for the treatment of covid-19 using repurposed drugs this represents an attractive drug strategy using currently available drugs this would reduce the time and costs in comparison with de novo drug development the antioxidant properties of melatonin would make it an appropriate candidate drug to relieve the clinical symptoms of patients infected with covid-19 although melatonin cannot interrupt the replication or transcription of this virusthe administration of melatonin may prolong the survival time of infected patients which indicates the possibility that the immune system of these patients recovers due to elimination of the virus since melatonin indirectly targets several human coronavirus cellular vital points such as ace2 bcl2l1 jun and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa b kinase subunit beta ikbkb 26 melatonin has also demonstrated its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in mice infected with a respiratory syncytial virus where it reduced the levels of tnf-alfa significantly nitric oxide no malondialdehyde mda and hydroxyl radical oh whereas it increased glutathione peroxidase gsh and superoxide dismutase sod activity therefore melatonin reversed all altered inflammatory and oxidative parameters of this respiratory viral infection which suggests it also may be useful in the treatment of covid-19 infection 27 additionally another study that suggested the use of melatonin in the management of covid-19 infection has also highlighted the high safety profile of this hormone which encourages even more so its clinical application 28it is also known that with advancing age not only causes a decline in immunity but also in melatonin and endogenous vitamin d production therefore this could also explain the greater susceptibility of older adults to death by covid-19 infection 29 it could also be hypothesized that there is a lower infection rate in older women because more of them are undergoing treatments for bone diseases that incorporate vitamin d supplements although there is no scientific evidence that supports thisall this evidence supports the beneficial effects of vitamin d and melatonin as being helpful against lung pathologies in pulmonary infection by covid-19 where there is also exacerbated inflammation oxidation and other similar pathophysiologic mechanisms this information suggests using analyzing both these natural compounds and well as their possible synergism to overcome this pandemic that affects many people around the world while searching for definitive treatment or vaccine continues additionally it is essential to assess the potential relationship between both compounds and the renin-angiotensin system as a mechanism of cell entry of covid-19 to establish potential treatments that avoid the first step in this viral infectionit has been suggested that the deficiency of vitamin d is usually associated with the hyper responsiveness of airways impaired pulmonary functions worse control of asthma and perhaps resistance to steroids pulmonary epithelial cells have a high expression of 1 alpha-hydroxylase level which allows the local synthesis of 1 25-dihydroxy vitamin d the active form of vitamin d also called calcitriol in the lungs calcitriol inhibits the production and secretion of many cytokines from bronchial smooth muscle cells such as growth factor derived from platelets rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted and matrix metalloproteinases which leads to a reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation and lung inflammation moreover vitamin d stimulates the synthesis of interleukin 10 by cd4cd25foxp3 t-regulatory cells and dendritic cells at the same time vitamin d inhibits the activation of dendritic cells by a downregulating expression of cd8086 and cd40 as co-stimulatory molecules and stimulates the expression of many anti-infective molecules 3031 1 25-dihydroxy vitamin d supplementation suppresses the recruitment of eosinophil and lymphocyte into the airways decreases il-4 production from t cells and inhibits the migration of t cells attenuating the inflammatory response 32vitamin d may also be useful as an adjuvant for other therapies such as allergen immunotherapy whose beneficial effects were improved by simultaneous 1 25-dihydroxy vitamin d administration to a mouse model of asthma 33 vitamin d and dexamethasone treatment administration to cultured cd4 regulatory t cells from steroid-resistant asthmatic patients increased the synthesis of il10 to levels similar to those found in steroid-sensitive patients treated only with dexamethasone 34 in a similar in vitro model of steroid resistance it was observed that vitamin d caused the inhibition of t cell proliferation when dexamethasone alone could not suppress cell proliferation 35 the high serum levels of ige and eotaxin found in an asthmatic rat model were also significantly reduced by the treatment with vitamin d 36 in asthmatic mice vitamin d treatment also decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells in airways the serum levels of il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf  and il 1 and the expression of bcl 2-associated x apoptotic protein caspase 3 casp3 high mobility group box 1 protein hmgb1 tlr4 nf b and phosphorylated nf b p65 likewise vitamin d elevated il10 serum levels reducing the inflammatory and apoptotic response in these mice 37 in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to pollutant particulate matter vitamin d suppressed the synthesis of 8-isoprostane 8-iso il-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated by this pollutant agent vitamin d caused a rise in the expression of g6pd antioxidant pathway gene and the levels of oxidized glutathione which suggest that vitamin d can protect the lungs and airways in asthmatic pathology through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects facing air pollutant exposure 38in a murine model of pulmonary inflammation induced by bleomycin calcitriol reduced early lung inflammation by attenuating immune cell infiltration repressing pulmonary inflammatory cytokines secretion blocking nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa b nf-b p65 inhibiting phosphorylation of pulmonary p38 mapk and protein kinase b akt attenuating -smooth muscle actin a marker for epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the lungs which promotes fibrosis and decreased transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-1 up-regulated and smad phosphorylation 39 calcitriol also caused a reduction of approximately 40 in neutrophil recruitment to lungs in an animal model of acute lung injury considerably inhibiting this pathological condition this anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin d may be mediated by the inhibition of il-8 secretion at the lung level 40 the administration of vitamin d to neonatal rats with lung injury induced by hyperoxia as a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia caused attenuation of this lesion via several protective actions such as preserving pulmonary structure integrity decreasing inflammation by downregulating tlr4 activation reducing the deposition of the extracellular matrix and inhibiting lung cell apoptosis 41 vitamin d has also shown to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of airway cystic fibrosis since it reduced the expression of cd279 pd-1 on cd4 and cd8 t cells moreover vitamin d decreased the frequency of cd8 t and mucosal-associated invariant t cells that co-express the cd38 activation markers and human leucocyte antigen d-related therefore vitamin d treatment would prevent lung damage progression associated with airway cystic fibrosis 42 the oxidative stress that causes tobacco smoke worsens the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in this sense vitamin d has also been proposed as a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant able to improve the prognosis of this lung pathology in smoking patients 43 in fact it has been observed that patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have lower plasma levels of vitamin d than healthy patients suggesting a possible correlation between a deficient antioxidant defense and development of this pulmonary disease 44 of central interest to our revision some years ago our group raised the discussion on a world pandemic of vitamin d deficiency as a possible explanation by cellular inflammatory response activity ras-induced 45 the original discussion involved a significant number of pathologies -mainly cardiovascular- but with a similar inflammatory basis at present with the central focus on the acute pulmonary inflammation caused by covid-19 the irish longitudinal study on ageing tilda 2020 reinforces the idea that an adequate supplementation of vitamin d especially in older people may be beneficial for vulnerable population groups during this covid-19 pandemic outbreak 46 graphical abstracttherapeutic potential of melatonin at the respiratory system level is mediated among other mechanisms by blockade of nuclear factor-appa beta nf- overexpress of c-fos and down-regulate of matrix metalloproteinases-3 mmp-3 which modulates pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokines 47 moreover the protective role of melatonin in pulmonary hypertension is due to its antioxidant anti-fibrotic and vasodilator properties 48 it has also been suggested that pretreatment with melatonin in a murine model of asthma reduces the accumulation of collagen in the airways possibly through the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 which modulates tissue remodeling therefore melatonin would be expected to exert an anti-inflammatory effect at the level of the airway 49melatonin has also been useful in the protection of pulmonary tissue during acute lung injury in rats due to its ability to eliminate free radicals and block the activation of nf-kappa b 50 5-hydroxy-2-isobutyl-streptochlorin his a novel derivative of melatonin with enhanced anti-inflammatory properties inhibits the penetration of immune cells into the lung and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 in a murine model of acute lung injury these anti-inflammatory effects of his were mediated by the modulation of the signaling pathway-dependent of interferon- and toll-like receptors moreover his inhibited the secretion of il-1 by blocking the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome independent of mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species 51 the lung surfactant lipid peroxidation is induced by the production of oxygen radicals from stimulated phagocytes responsible for the development and progression of acute lung injury in this sense melatonin alone or combined with other antioxidants markedly reduced lipid peroxidation of this pulmonary surfactant 52 intratracheal administration of melatonin provoked a marked reduction of lung lesions and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to lungs during acute pulmonary injury furthermore melatonin inhibited the nlrp3 inflammasome activation through the suppression of extracellular histone release 53it has been suggested that melatonin inhibits pulmonary fibrosis in animal models through the decrease in the migration of fibroblasts as a consequence of the reduction in the activity of chloride channels mediated by protein kinase c 54 in an animal model with pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin melatonin provoked a significant reduction in edema and lesions at the lung level likewise melatonin treatment lowered the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 which produces eicosanoids whose role is crucial in the development of pulmonary fibrosis besides melatonin caused a decrease in interstitial tissue percentage volume and an increase in the alveolar space percentage volume 55 melatonin attenuated the pneumonitis and lung fibrosis caused by radiation exposure through a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltration collagen deposition edema and vascular and alveolar thickening in the lungs 56 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes the progressive loss of pulmonary function due to tissue cicatrization interesting it has been reported that melatonin and its metabolites can modulate many pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis such as transforming growth factor  wnt catenin interleukin 17a vascular endothelial growth factor fibroblast growth factors platelet-derived growth factor renin-angiotensin system endothelin 1 and impaired caveolin 1 function causing protective effects on lungs 57 by removing free radicals melatonin may adequately modulate autophagy pathways and apoptosis which are key mechanism in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 58 additionally the utilization of melatonin in the treatment of animals with induced hepatopulmonary syndrome was effective in the reduction of lung fibrosis levels vasodilation and oxidative stress 59melatonin also ameliorates pulmonary lesions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress caused by nitrogen mustard in rodents since it acts as a powerful antioxidant that eliminates both reactive nitrogen and oxygen species and as a potent anti-inflammatory agent 60 61 62 the pretreatment with melatonin combined or not with quercetin in rats with hypoxia-induced by sodium nitrite considerably reduced the plasma levels of il-6 tnf- and crp heat shock protein 70 extracellular hsp70e and vegf additionally melatonin enhanced the histopathological changes in the lungs of these animals also suggesting powerful protective effects of melatonin at the pulmonary level 63 melatonin has a potent pulmonary protective effect in rats with lung injury induced by phosgene and this protective mechanism can be associated with the elimination of free radicals and the inhibition of p38 mapk activation and inos expression 64 pretreatment with melatonin is effective in reducing lung damage in patients subjected to chemotherapy melatonin with cyclophosphamide decrease lipid peroxidation restoring the glutathione levels and superoxide dismutasecatalase activities furthermore the mentioned association could reduce the typical histological abnormalities in the lungs of patients with chemotherapy 65melatonin has also inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna and nuclear factor-b nf-b in a murine model of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension this molecule also suppressed the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the concentrations of phosphorylated akt and kinases 12 modulated by extracellular signal provoked by hypoxia in an in vitro model these results also suggest significant antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin at the pulmonary level 66 postnatal administration of melatonin reduced the pathological vascular remodeling and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia in neonatal lambs with pulmonary hypertension on the other hand melatonin increased angiogenesis in these animals these effects enhance the pulmonary vascular function and structure in the neonatal period under conditions of chronic hypoxia 6768melatonin also markedly inhibited the pulmonary injury induced by hepatic ischemiareperfusion in rats through its anti-inflammatory properties achieved the reduction in apoptosis of lung cells by blocking of jnk p38 and nf-b activation and stimulating of nrf2 activation 69 in mice with induced lung ischemia-reperfusion melatonin pretreatment achieved a reduction of the damage in lung parenchymal and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 tnf- and ikk- apoptotic markers such as baxbcl-2 and cleaved casp3 and tunel positive cells were also inhibited in addition melatonin pretreatment increased the expression and activity of cellular antioxidant systems superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase 70in an animal model of neurogenic pulmonary edema melatonin attenuated the dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary barrier by inhibiting the disruption of tight junction proteins such as zo-1 and occludin furthermore it caused a downregulation of myeloperoxidase and interleukin il -1 as well as provoked an inhibition of the activation of matrix metallopeptidase 9 in addition the melatonin treatment considerably decreased casp3 activity and the number of positive lung cells in the tunel assay therefore melatonin treatment enhanced the prognosis of neurogenic pulmonary edema due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects 71 melatonin also exerted its anti-inflammatory antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects in a murine model of lung aging significantly reducing the expression of apoptosis markers such as bax bad aif inflammatory markers such as il-1 tnf- ho-1 nfb2 and the oxidative damage to rna measured as the production of 8-hydroxyguanosine 72it is well documented that melatonin prevents chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by attenuating nlrp3 inflammasome and il-1 responsible for the inflammation of airways during this pathology additionally melatonin caused an increase in silent information regulator 1 sirt1 expression which mediates the mentioned anti-inflammatory effect and other additional protective mechanisms such as the attenuation of apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress 7374melatonin caused a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation of airways and lungs and reduced the chronic cough induced by particulate matter 25 m in a pig model 75 additionally it has been demonstrated that environmental pollution in the form of particulate matter 25 m stimulated the melatonin synthesis at lung level in order to protect lung tissues from the damage provoked by the inhalation of polluted air 76the administration of ramelteon an agonist of melatonin receptor in an animal model of lung injury induced by ventilation and notably decreased the pulmonary edema malondialdehyde concentrations the levels of proinflammatory cytokines the activation of nf-b the expression of inos and apoptosis in lung cells moreover ramelteon treatment markedly elevated the expression of intracellular protective heat shock protein 70 hsp70i in lung cells and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid these results suggest that the protective effects of melatonin on lung disease are mainly mediated by a melatonin receptor 77it was documented that exposure to nicotine in pregnant rats caused significant changes in the lungs of their offspring at a structural and biochemical level in this regard melatonin treatment reduced the altered parameters by a lowering in the number of alveolar macrophages and mast cells as well as in the levels of malondialdehyde 78 melatonin also significantly reduced the oxidative stress and injury of lungs exposed to radiation through the suppression in the infiltration of neutrophils cd11bly6g and macrophages cd11bcd11c- and the down-regulation of nlrp3 inflammasome in macrophages accompanied with a reduction in the release of il-1 and the activity of caspase-1 or casp1 by the up-regulation of mir-30e levels 79 melatonin treatment decreased lung injury in rats exposed to chromium by up-regulating sirt1 which promotes the deacetylation of the transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator-1 pgc-1 at the same time this caused a rise in the expression of crucial antioxidant target genes and the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nrf2 these findings indicate that melatonin exerts anti-inflammatory antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects in the attenuation of lung injury provoked by chromium exposure through sirt1pgc-1nrf2 signaling pathway 80 it has also been determined that melatonin was able to mitigate the lung damage induced by carbon tetrachloride by the elimination of free radicals the increase in the antioxidant ability of pulmonary tissues and the induction of an effective anti-inflammatory response 81melatonin also reduced the increased levels of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase in the pulmonary tissue of diabetic rats moreover it attenuated the bronchial hyperplasia and reduced the cleaved-caspase 3 expression which was significantly increased in these animals 82 graphical abstractof special interest a clinical trial about the use of melatonin in the prophylaxis of covid-19 infection among healthcare workers is carrying out clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04353128 moreover many other human trials have demonstrated the efficacy of melatonin in the reduction of elevated levels of circulating cytokines in multiple inflammatory pathologies suggesting that melatonin would also useful in the treatment of covid-19 infection by decreasing plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines 83 84 85 86 87 88 furthermore other clinical trials showed that melatonin is effective against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 89 and multiple newborn diseases associated with increased oxidative stress at lung levels and in many other organs due to its important antioxidative properties 90it is known that there is a strong interaction between melatonin and ras 9192 in this regard melatonin treatment caused a reduction in at1 expression and normalized the ang ii levels in a model of renal disease 93 it is also known that there is a local pineal ras that modulates the synthesis of melatonin in this regard it has been indicated that ang ii acts on the at1 receptors located in pineal gland cells to regulate the expression and activity of tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme which is involved in the synthesis of melatonin it has also been demonstrated that the antioxidant anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects of melatonin are opposite for ang ii 94 it has reported that patients with chronic renal disease secrete lower nocturnal melatonin concentrations than healthy patients this altered secretion may be related to increased nocturnal intrarenal ras activation and kidney damage in patients with this renal disease this fact reinforces the existence of a close antagonistic interaction between ras and melatonin 95 in this regard it is known that reactive oxygen species are crucial in the activation of intrarenal ras also it has been shown that antioxidant treatment with melatonin ameliorates the intrarenal ras over-activation and renal injury in a 56 nephrectomized rat model of chronic kidney disease 9396 despite the lack of studies that specifically show a relationship between melatonin and ras at the lung level the existing evidence of this relationship in other organs such as the kidney suggests the possibility of similar behavior at the respiratory levelconcerning vitamin dras interaction the participation of ace2ang1-7masr signaling pathway in the neuroprotective effects of vitamin d in the brain has recently demonstrated in hypertensive rats 97 and it has found that vitamin d acts as a cofactor in the attenuation of incident atrial fibrillation by raas inhibition 98 furthermore the re-establishment of normal vitamin d levels in patients with d hypovitaminosis provokes blockade of peripheral ras 99 exacerbated activation of ras at the hepatic level causes liver dysfunction and increases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in this sense it has been found that calcitriol modulates the altered up-regulation of the liver ras in conditions of insulin resistance 100 vitamin d is a potent suppressor of renin production thus low plasma levels of vitamin d are associated with an increase in the synthesis of renin which results in an over-activation of ras and an increased production of ang ii and vice versa 101102 it has been demonstrated that vitamin d deficiency also results in overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzymes ace and ace2 103it has also been observed that vitamin d receptor-null mice develop more serious induced acute lung injury than wild-type mice with increased levels of pulmonary ang ii and renin pretreatment of vitamin d receptor-null mice with losartan reduced the severity of the pulmonary injury indicating that vitamin d via its receptors attenuates acute lung injury by blocking ras 104 moreover if vitamin d deficiency is chronic the uncontrolled ras over-activation for extended periods may induce pulmonary fibrosis through the exacerbated and accelerated increase in extracellular matrix deposition in lung tissues 105 graphical abstractthe combined supplementation of vitamin d with melatonin could offer an attractive synergistic alternative for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary infection by covid-19 these molecules modulate the same signaling pathways that relate to anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory antioxidant anti-fibrotic as well as anti-apoptotic effects in many tissues with special focus at the lung level both natural compounds are highly safe for clinical use they have many shared underlying mechanisms that allow them to exert potentiating actions aimed at strengthening the immune system and preparing the body to overcome the severe pathological consequences of covid-19 infection and if there is an infection reduce its high mortality ratethere exist many therapeutic objectives when evaluating the efficacy of vitamin d and melatonin in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 infection however ras ends up being the bottleneck a central signaling pathway because it constitutes a common meeting point for this triad ras stimulation with the consecutive inflammatory storm favors the infection evolution and outcome of this complex new pathologic entity as previously suggested the global deficiency of vitamin d as a result among others of cultural changes could respond mechanistically at least in part to higher inflammatory processes as a consequence of lack of brake that vitamin d exerts typically on the ras system during healthy conditions 45as a perspective it would be of interest to carry out clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic utility of the vitamin dmelatonin combination both in healthy patients and those infected with covid-19 and to compare the effects of its joint administration versus their individual administration in this regard it would be specially interesting adequately to define both melatonin and vitamin d supplementation regime used taking into account both group and individual features of patients that will participate of these studies since not considering these aspects may lead to obtain heterogeneous and controversial results that could affect their general applicability 106 however with the central focus on acute lung inflammation caused by covid-19 a longitudinal study suggest adequate vitamin d levels in vulnerable groups during this pandemic outbreak by covid-19 46 the last findings showed that the degree of protection against infections increases as vitamin d levels increase but this relationship has not allowed establishing an adequate cut level yet still an observational study reported that 38 ngml are appropriate values to decrease the risk of acute viral respiratory infections 107 on the other hand some authors suggest maintaining a serum vitamin d level at least 30 ngml or even maintaining it in a range of between 40 and 60 ngml to reduce infectious processes moreover recently dr alipio has provided substantial information to physicians and health policymakers specifically it concluded that vitamin d supplementation improves the clinical course of patients infected with covid-19 based on the increased probability of having a mild result when the serum level of vitamin d increases while a serum decrease in vitamin d is associated with worse clinical evolution 108 the same recommendation was reinforced by grant and colleagues who suggested that vitamin d supplementation could reduce the risk of covid-19 infection 109 also rhodes and collaborators have proposed vitamin d supplementation at least for those in the northern hemisphere who are at higher risk of severe illness and death 110 the same is recommended by the united kingdom association of dietitians 111 and editorials in international scientific rigorsfinally although there are some controversies regarding the effectiveness of vitamin d and melatonin in clinical studies such contradictions are the consequence of experimental designs with many errors the latest findings -with better designs- begin to show robust evidence of benefits so melatonin on the one hand and vitamin d on the other would be complicit endogenous as physiological responders andor exogenous drugs in therapeutics treatment which could alleviate the pathological process even before the infection developsthis work was supported by grants from the research and technology council of cuyo university 1013039501100007351secyt mendoza argentina and from

publication of this articlesince its first emergence in december 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 a novel human coronavirus hcov has spread across the world at an alarming rate sars-cov-2 was named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv based on the phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov 12 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the diseases caused by sars-cov-2 is far more extensive than the previous hcov-diseases with the number of confirmed patients worldwide has currently exceeded 40 million 3 4 5after the outbreak of covid-19 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was promptly been identified as the functional receptor of sars-cov-2 2 ace2 is mainly distributed on the surface of well-differentiated airway epithelial cells especially ciliated cells and the respiratory tract has shown to be a predominant channel for hcov to invade the human body 6 sars-cov-2 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection resulting in acute lung injury ali acute respiratory distressed syndrome ards and potentially death 7 a retrospective study of 1099 covid-19 patients from zhong nanshans group showed 911  of the patients developed pneumonia and 34  of the patients developed ards 8 while chen and colleagues reported that over 17  of the patients with covid-19 in wuhan developed ards 9 the fatality rate worldwide has currently reached 70  3 and respiratory failure has been considered to be the leading cause 695  of sars-cov-2 related death 10 to provide some implications for clinical therapy and drug exploration we reviewed covid-19 related clinical studies by searching the keywords sars-cov-2 covid-19 and 2019-ncov on sinomed pubmed embase who and medrxiv to explore the possible influencing factors behind covid-19 exacerbation and related biochemical indicatorsseveral clinical studies have shown that lymphopenia occurs frequently in covid-19 patients manifested as the decrease of total t cells cd4t cells and cd8t cells in the peripheral blood with the degree of decline related to the severity of the disease compared with patients with mild symptoms a higher proportion of severe or deceased patients had lymphopenia 10 11 12 13 14 which is similar to the observation during sars-cov infection 15 according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 published by national health commission of china 16 an autopsy report of a patient who died from covid-19 indicated 1 the spleen atrophied significantly with apparent focal hemorrhage and necrosis 2 lymphocytes in the lymph nodes were depleted and necrotized and 3 the number of cd4t and cd8t cells in spleen and lymph nodes decreased significantly these pathological characteristics coincide with that of patients who died of sars-cov infection 17 furthermore compared with sars in 2003 severe covid-19 tends to have a higher viral load and a longer virus-shedding period 1819 since the rna sequence of sars-cov was found in the macrophages and aggregated t cells of lymph nodes 20 the direct impairment from sars-cov-2 may be an important cause of lymphopenia in patients with covid-19the severe damage in lymphoid organs by sars-cov-2 may relate to the ineffective control of the virus infection during the early stage which has been seen in sars-cov infection 21 type  interferon ifn including ifn- and ifn- plays a critical role in prohibiting viral infections and initiating adaptive immune responses including in sars-cov infection 2122 type  ifn can inhibit virus replication in vitro as well as in macaques and mice 23 24 25 26 however sars-cov may delay or evade innate immune response through early antagonism on ifn response in which ifn can only be detected after sars-cov reached a high titer 72728 present evidence implied that the viral load of sars-cov-2 peaks at the time of presentation even earlier than the time to peak of sars-cov 29 we suspected that similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 may escape from the immune response through the physical cover of double-membrane vesicles dmv and the chemical interference of the proteins encoded by itself 3031the clearance of the virus mainly depends on cellular immunity 32 innate antiviral signaling is initiated upon the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps by specific pattern recognition receptor prr molecules expressed on host cells 3334 this ultimately leads to the activation of transcriptional factors primarily interferon regulatory factor irf and nuclear factor-kappab nf-b for the induction of type  ifn and other proinflammatory mediators 3334 rig- like receptors rlr and toll-like receptors tlr are two types of prr that can recognize viral pamp 34 sars-cov encoded structural proteins such as n protein and m protein nonstructural proteins nsp and accessory proteins like orf3b and orf6 to antagonize the recognition and signal transduction 31 n protein inhibits inf- synthesis by inhibiting the activation of irf-3 and nf-kb 35 m protein prevents gene transcription of inf- by inhibiting the activation of irf-3irf-7 transcription factors 36 other proteins such as nsp1 nsp3 orf3b and orf6 et al can also antagonize ifn responses 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 recently a team from the university of chicago identified that the protein nsp15 from sars-cov-2 is 89  identical to the nsp15 found in sars-cov 44 since nsp15 acts as an endoribonuclease for the viruss double-stranded rna inhibition of nsp15 could slow viral replication 45 most recently kim et al reported sars-cov-2 can also express orf7a 3a 8 6 and 7b 46 indicating that targeting these proteins may help to recover the inhibition of sars-cov-2 infection at an early stagein addition to lymphopenia sars-cov-2 may also induce t cell exhaustion 47 expression of immune-checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death 1 pd-1 and t cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 tim-3 accompanied by the elevation of anti-inflammatory cytokines is known to be the common indicators of t cell depletion 48 wangs team has observed that up-regulated pd-1 and tim-3 between covid-19 patients and healthy individuals and between prodromal stages and overtly symptomatic stages among covid-19 patients which was also associated with the increased levels of anti-inflammatory il-10 47 the expression of inhibitory immune receptors t-cell immunoglobulin and itim domain tigit and the cd94nk group 2 member a nkg2a on cd8  t cells were increased significantly in covid-19 patients 4950 however our current knowledge about t cell mainly cd8  t cell depletion gained from the research of tumors and chronic viral infection such as hiv and hbv it is generally believed that this phenomenon occurs when the body has been stimulated by antigens for a long period of time which is not in line with acute viral infection 4851 therefore it is not clear that t cell exhaustion is actually accruing in sars-cov-2 infectionsince sars-cov-2 can escape from the host immunity by inhibiting the production of type i ifn during the early stage of infection an artificial supplement of ifn- during the early stage of covid-19 infection may help to relieve injuries caused by the virus however we do not recommend applying glucocorticoids gss in the early stage as early use of immunosuppressive medications may exacerbate the viruss damage to the bodyalthough the direct damage from the viruses contributes to the initiation of the disease the cytokine storm caused by hcov plays a vital role in the development of ali and ard 7 cytokines are a group of small molecular proteins secreted by immune and tissue cells that includes interleukin il colony-stimulating factor gsf ifn tumor necrosis factor tnf growth factor gf and chemokines cytokines participate in immune responses through the activation of multiple signaling pathways such as jak-stat traf-nf-b traf-ap-1 and irak-nf-b 32 the term cytokine storm appeared for the first time in an article relating to graft-versus-host disease in 1993 52 as an interpretation for mechanisms of immune diseases or chronic inflammation gradually scientists found that viruses including cytomegalovirus streptococci influenza virus and sars-cov can also evoke cytokine storms 53 54 55 56 during viral infection prrs activate irf and nf-b pathways by recognizing pamp then promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from infected local epithelial cells or macrophages these cytokine-activated macrophages and virus-infected dendritic cells dc lead to a broader immune response attracting more inflammatory cells to inflammatory sites releasing a large number of cytokines which eventually results in a cytokine storm excessive cytokines may spill into the circulatory system and cause systemic cytokine storms resulting in multiple organ dysfunction 757previously it has been found that the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-  il-1 il-6 il-12 and transforming growth factor- tgf- and chemokines ccl2 cxcl9 cxcl10 and il-8 in sars-cov infected patients were higher than those in healthy individuals while the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in severe patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls 58 59 60 at the beginning of the epidemic huang et al reported that the plasma levels of il2 il7 gscf cxcl10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf- were higher in covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit icu than those of covid-19 patients outside the icu 61 furthermore the relatively higher level of serum ferritin was also seen in deceased patients comparing with discharged patients and in severe patients comparing with mild patients 6263 thus the pattern of cytokine storm in covid-19 patients was thought to be similar to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh 64 65 66 unlike the cytokines profile of sars patients covid-19 patients have a remarkable increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 table 1
 which has been often seen in hlh patients in previous studies 616768 compared with other increased cytokines increased il-10 was frequently associated with il-6 in patients with severe diseasetable 1 13694761 suggesting both il-10 and il-6 are the indicators of covid-19 exacerbationil-6 a kind of pleiotropic cytokine is expressed by immune cells such as dc monocytes macrophages b cells and subsets of activated t cells as well as by non-immune cells like fibroblasts epithelial cells and keratinocytes 74 75 76 77 it can activate jakstat raserkcebp and p3 kakt pathways through il-6r and signal-transducing coreceptor gp130 7879 il-6 also regulates b cell proliferation and differentiation and induces t cell differentiation 80 81 82 although il-6 has been proposed to be involved in the repair of lung injury in the mouse model of influenza a h1n1 virus 83 it contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory or autoimmunity diseases 8485 and excessive production of il-6 leads to serious disease progression in viral infection 8687il-10 is also a pleiotropic cytokine that limits and terminates inflammatory responses through inhibiting antigen-presenting cells apc pro-inflammatory cytokines production and t cell response 88 various subpopulations of cd4 helper t th cells including th1 th2 and th17 produce il-10 as an important self-regulatory function of th cells during infections 89 90 91 92 although reducing il-10 levels could improve the resistance to infection in some animal models the weakening control of inflammatory responses may cause significant damage to the hosts at the same time 93 thus il-10 plays a central role in maintaining a balance between damage and protectionil-6 induces nive t cells to differentiate into th2 cells and th17 cells and the activated th2 and th17 cells produce il-10 that regulates the immune response 94 95 96 97 98 fig 1
 the similarity in the signaling network between il-10 receptors and il-6r suggests the common biological process among il-10 and il-6 99 it has been reported that il-6 cooperated with il-10 to eliminate pathogens and modulate the cellular immune response in the patient infected with the h1n1 influenza virus but the produced immunosuppressive environment delayed virus clearance or increase secondary infection 86100 pathological findings of a deceased covid-19 patient showed elevated il-6 and il-10 with increased highly proinflammatory ccr4ccr6th17 in peripheral cd4t cells 101 rapid accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines stimulates the over-reaction of anti-inflammatory response resulting in severe immune injury in patients chinese diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 suggests the increase of il-6 as an indicator for critical patients 16 we recommend measuring both il-10 and il-6 as the signs of the cytokine storm intensification in covid-19 patientsgreat attention has been paid to the cytokine storm in covid-19 infection to address the immediate need for reducing the rising mortality anti-inflammatory medications are commonly used for the management of cytokine storm which includes gcs intravenous immune globulin ivig and inflammatory cytokines antagonists such as il-1r antagonists il-6r antagonists and jak inhibitors however gcs may slow down the clearance of the coronavirus 102 high-dose ivig at the early stage of clinical deterioration was reported to be successful in three cases 103 and an ongoing randomized controlled trial rct of ivig in severe covid-19 patients nct04261426 may provide more authoritative evidence of this treatmentsince il-1 and il-6 are the major cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of shlh 65 the il-6r antagonist tocilizumab and sarilumab and il-1r antagonists anakinra may be effective choices a retrospective study of continuous intravenous infusion of anakinra in five patients established a rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with shlh 104 and a randomized placebo-controlled phase iii trial indicated that anakinra reduced mortality in sepsis patients with features of shlh 105 tocilizumab which attracts more attention compared with anakinra was found to improve fever hypoxemia lung lesions and crp levels in most of the severe covid-19 patients with no obvious adverse reactions in retrospective studies but several patients still aggravated 106107 serum level of il-6 after tocilizumab therapy tended to further spike initially and then decrease while the patients who failed treatment exhibited a persistent and dramatic increase of il-6 107108 nevertheless we cannot draw any firm conclusions on the efficacy and safety of anakinra or tocilizumab due to the limited sample size and retrospective method of the present evidence further studies are required to determine the probability of potential secondary infection and to find an appropriate biochemical indicator for monitoring the therapeutic effect clinical trials evaluating anakinra nct04341584 nct04324021 nct04339712 and nct04330638 and tocilizumab chictr2000029765 chictr2000030796 chictr2000030894 nct04317092 nct04335071 and nct04320615 et al in the treatment of covid-19 are ongoing across the worldsecondary bacterial infection has been found to further exacerbate viral pneumonia which is also related to the imbalance of t cells and plasma cytokines 109 bacterial coinfection is known to be associated with approximately 40  of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization 110 early detection of bacterial infection and timely intervention will help to alleviate the deterioration of covid-19 procalcitonin pct released by bacterial infectious tissues under the irritation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a more specific marker of serious bacterial infection compared to c-reactive protein crp and il-6 111 pct-based strategy has been applied to guide antibiotic use in icu or emergency wards since the serum pct levels in patients with severe bacterial infections are much higher than those with simple viral infections or non-specific inflammatory diseases 111 112 113 antimicrobial interventions are encouraged in patients with lower respiratory tract infection who has the value of pct  025 ngml or  05 ngml for they are likely or highly-likely respectively to undergo a bacterial infection 113114multiple studies have shown that pct levels increased in critical or deceased covid-19 patients table 2
 li et al 115 reported that 905  of deceased patients had elevated pct levels 01175 ngml including pct  025 ngml in 12 patients and pct  05 ngml in 9 patients and the pct value increased from the admission to death in another retrospective study of 1099 covid-19 patients higher proportions of pct  05 ngml were found in severe cases than mild cases 137  vs 37  8 patients who reached primary composite endpoint including admission to an icu the use of mechanical ventilation or death had a higher proportion of pct  05 ngml than patients without end-point events 240  vs 39  8 the correlation between increased pct and severe covid-19 was also observed in pediatric patients 116 these findings although preliminary suggested that bacterial infection may promote the aggravation of covid-19 timely measuring pct as a sign of secondary bacterial infection for the decision of antibacterial agents use is critical for covid-19 patients the aggravation of covid-19 ascribed to the secondary bacterial infection and the adverse events caused by unreasonable use of antibiotics could be reduced the most effective selection of the antibiotic agents should be based on bacterial culture in consideration of the dysregulation of the immune system in severe covid-19 patients antibiotic agents with immunomodulatory effects such as macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin might be a better option previous studies have shown that in addition to antibacterial effects these drugs can also alleviate inflammatory reactions by reducing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulating neutrophil function and apoptosis 117 118 119 120the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is threatening the world with substantial mortality sars-cov-2 could cause lymphopenia and cytokine storm together with secondary bacterial infections adding to the deterioration of the disease in severe cases of covid-19 understandings of the dynamic process of sars-cov-2 infection would help to make an appropriate decision on treatment strategies we recommend measuring both il-10 and il-6 as a sign of intensification of cytokine storm in severe covid-19 cases though test il-10 is not routinely carried out in the clinic setting we also recommend using serum pct level to guild the initiation of antibacterial agents in patient with covid-19 although the selection of immunomodulators is challenging previous retrospective studies have revealed distinct immune regulators between the early and late stages of sars-cov-2 infection for instance supplementation of type  ifn instead of gcs at the early stage of infection may help to control the virus and relieve injury il-1r and il-6r antagonists could potentially be the effective choices for managing cytokine storm however these preliminary results would need to be validated from multiple ongoing rcts due to the rapid nature of covid-19 pandemic global collaboration in research and information sharing is ultimately needednonesince december 2019 there has been an outbreak of coronavirus known as sars-cov-2 started in wuhan china and has quickly disseminated around the world 1 the who has announced the new coronavirus cov infection as a public health emergency of international concern pheic january 30 2020 and named it coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 based on genome analysis sars-cov-2 is similar to sars-cov which belongs to -lineage coronaviruses 2 and as a zoonotic virus it possibly originates from bats 3 sars-cov-2 like sars-cov binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein to infect various cell types 4 especially lung heart kidney and testes 5 indeed the full entry is achieved by a cellular serine protease named tmprss2 that prepares the effective form of viral antigenic s protein 6 however new studies referred to cd147 as another novel rout to invade host cells by the virus 7 cd147 is a transmembrane glycolprotein belongs to immunoglobulin super family which highly expresses in inflamed tissues virus-infected cells and tumor tissues 8 9 10 according to the study performed by guan et al the covid-19 is less severe and less fatal in comparison to the sars but some patients especially elderly with underlying co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and hypertension are susceptible to develop more severe symptoms or even death 11 similar to sars-cov infection the clinical symptoms of covid-19 vary ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 12 13 14it is not completely understood why some patients develop severe but others have mild disease or even stay asymptomatic maybe the ways immune system encountering with the virus will answer the question and better understanding of all aspects of immune-virus interactions help the management of the infectionobviously immune system is the greatest player dealing with all types of infections nonetheless in the case of covid-19 it is somehow blurry whether the activation of host immune responses is protective or destructive a well-contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses may rapidly take control of the virus and clear infected particles from the body while dysregulated immune responses result in viral spreading multi-organ failure and high mortality 15 thus deep investigations of immunological events that take place during covid-19 and of relative cellular or molecular mechanisms seem to be helpful although researchers are attempting these days to develop vaccines and analyzing anti-viral drugs in clinical trials 16 there are no effective prophylactic and clinical treatment options for covid-19 yetthis study aimed to describe the pathogenesis and protective roles of immune responses in covid-19 in the terms of innate and adaptive immunity besides potential immunological treatment tools and preventive approaches have been mentionedmacrophages are one of the important parts of the innate immunity which possess heterogeneous subsets including monocyte-derived macrophages and tissue resident population with a variety of characteristic features from classically activated macrophage m1 to alternatively activated macrophage m2 like phenotype 21 according to the literature performed by wang et al alveolar macrophages with sars-cov-2 infection express ace2 receptor which eventuates in activation and secretion a large number of inflammatory cytokines following binding to the virus along with an extensive macrophage and monocyte infiltration into the lung 25 in another study conducted by zhou et al it is mentioned that inflammatory monocytes cd14cd16 which were gm-csfil-6 increased in intensive care unit icu patients these monocytes were capable of lung migration in which they could further differentiate to macrophages or monocyte-derived dendritic cells 26 in parallel zhang et al analyzed peripheral blood monocyte cells pbmcs samples of covid-19 individuals and revealed no changes in monocyte frequency however a significant difference in morphology and marker expression of these cells was observed with an inflammatory phenotype as a result of il-6 il-10 and tnf- secretion along with the higher expression of cd11b cd14 cd16 cd68 cd80 cd163 and cd206 on their surfaces to create the first highly inflammatory environment during disease process 27 the accumulation and activation of macrophages and monocytes trigger uncontrolled cytokine storm especially in severe cases that leads to the shift of m1 to m2 phenotype of alveolar macrophages and further contribute to the inflammatory injuries and fibrosis of respiratory tracts 2528 in convinced with this idea a group of macrophages has been described in patients with sars-cov-2 express genes related to tissue repair and fibrosis generation like that is seen in liver cirrhosis 29 therefore the pathogenicity of activated macrophages in lung might be associated with fibrotic complications along with acute inflammation which are pointed out in covid-19 patients with ards 30 however it is not obvious how sars-cov-2 interferes with macrophagemonocyte functions and employs them to survive and infect other cells additional researches are needed to come up with some logical reasonsrecently reyfman and colleagues have been identified four groups of lung macrophages classified by fcn1 spp1 and fabp4 markers group 1  2 are monocyte-derived fcn1 macrophages that produce abundant inflammatory chemokines and activate the interferon-stimulated genes cooperating in hyper-inflammation process 31 referring to the study conducted by liao et al fcn1 macrophages are dominated in the severely damaged lungs from covid-19 patients with ards 32 group 3 was discovered as spp1 macrophages which neutralize the inflammatory consequences of fcn1 cells and represent a probable pro-fibrotic feature 31 however fabp4 alveolar macrophages ams the group 4 were a predominant macrophage subset in covid-19 patients with mild disease although they were completely absent in severely infected patients 32 according to researches fabp4 ams play an important role in metabolizing lipid surfactant 21 induced by the cytokine granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf 33 and it was supposed that the absence of ams in severely infected cases may contribute to lung failuresapart from the immune cells it is declared that alveolar epithelial cells contribute in innate immunity against covid-19 in the lung it has been shown that sars-cov-2 preferentially infects alveolar type ii atii cells which involve 515 of the lung epithelium and express ace2 receptor on their surfaces intensively 634 35 36 atii cells are also able to synthesize and secret surfactant protein a sp-a which has a crucial role in surfactant metabolism and lung innate immunity 37 according to the research of qian et al sars-cov is able to propagate in atii cells until the cells undergo apoptosis or die and the viral particles are released in adjacent area 38 atii cells can activate and produce inflammatory cytokines through expressing toll-like receptors tlrs in response to sars-cov-2 infection and recruit or activate other immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils besides atii cells and alveolar macrophages coordinate inflammatory responses which may underlie lung injury associated with covid-19 34 35 36gao et al showed that 29 out of 75 covid-19 patients had an increase in their neutrophil percentage 39 in contrast ying xia et al showed that neutrophil percentage of severe covid-19-patients drastically declined 40 in a comparative point of view this difference in neutrophil percentages could be explained in this way that gao et al did not consider patients in clinically severe and mild group but mentioned that in il-6 elevated patients n  14 whereas in ying xia et al study major population of patients were severe cases and showed a pattern of immune dysfunction in a cohort study with 61 covid-19 patients the importance of neutrophils was noticed in neutrophillymphocyte ratio nlr as a prognosis factor indeed the high frequency of neutrophils in blood leads to vast neutrophil infiltration into lungs versus low existence of lymphocytes in the periphery representing immune dysregulation by the virus in severe condition however xin et al suggested that the application of neutrophil to cd8t cells ratio n8r must be carefully considered as more accurate and valuable prognostic index for estimating of covid-19 severity in patients because cd8 t cells are the main subpopulation of lymphocytes that decreased in this case 41 xianbo et al evaluated the prognosis value of nlr in a more comprehensive view they defined a cut off value of 313 for nlr and an age range of 50 as an early sign of developing severe disease which might become life-saving by early disease handling 42an important functional aspect of neutrophils in covid-19 is neutrophil extracellular traps nets in general nets blood level in ards patients is higher which is related to higher severity and mortality 43 kanthi and knight et al showed that in a population of 50 hospitalized covid-19 patients the laboratory markers of netosis including cell free dna myeloperoxidase mpo-dna and citrullinated histon h3 cith3 increased dramatically besides cell free dna manifested a strong correlation with inflammatory markers such as c-reactive protein crp d-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase surprisingly they showed that covid-19 sera induce net formation in neutrophils of healthy individuals and defined a pro-netotic state for severe cases in this regard factors like virally damaged epithelial cells activated platelets or endothelial cells and inflammation related cytokines announced possibly responsible 44 considering all these studies neutrophils act as the main cells in predicting the covid-19 outcome in infected ones so identifying the precise mechanism and changes seems to be usefulas it is well known b cells could activate and defense against viruses so that some studies have detected binding and neutralizing antibodies in sars-cov infections and reported robust antibody responses in severely infected sars patients 4647 however the dynamics of the antibody secretion in covid-19 patients are under investigation due to antibodies are considered as potential diagnostic tools to complement real-time pcr assayreferring to the clinical reports and primary time course of covid-19 the disease is detected after 12 days following the symptoms representation peaking 46 days later and finally clearing within 18 days 48 based on evidences seroconversion is obvious at approximately day 18 with maximum anti-virus igg titer measured 20 days after disease onset this process with better knowledge about the dynamics of immunological events during covid-19 can help health authorities to manage the disease outbreak and confer a deeper prospective of protective strategies to eradicate the infection 49in a study performed by xiao et al the antibody profile of 34 sars-cov-2 patients during 7 weeks was analyzed in which all individuals were positive for igm and igg at week 3 after the onset of disease the level of igm decreased at week 4 2 patients were negative at week 5 and 2 patients else at the end of observation week 7 this result revealed the acute phase of infection lasts more than 1 month in most patients along with igm decreasing igg level elevated from week 3 to week 7 representing the activation of humoral immune response to the infection 50 in another study li guo et al profiled the early antibody response to sars-cov-2 using 208 plasma samples collected from 82 positive and 58 probable cases the samples were examined by elisa test on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid rn protein achieved results showed that igm and iga antibodies were detected 5 days after symptom onset while igg was detectable on 14 days it is declared that in comparison to real-time pcr the detection efficiency by igm elisa was higher after 55 days of symptom onset and once igm elisa assay combined with pcr the positive detection rate significantly increased 986 to diagnosis of covid-19 51 additional study on the dynamics of covid-19 specific antibodies in 173 patients reported that seroconversion occurred sequentially for total antibody igm and igg with median time of 11 12 and 14 days respectively the receptor-binding domain rbd epitope of the s1 subunit was used to detect igm by double recombinant antigens sandwich immunoassay and igg antibodies were detected using recombinant np antigen through indirect elisa kit remarkably the antibody detectability was lower than pcr test up to 7 days since the symptom initiation while raised gradually from day 8 to day 39 overtaking the pcr test surprisingly the levels of viral rna in patients samples were found undetectable alongside the levels of total antibody were measured in the sera these evidences highlight the extreme importance of combining molecular and serological tests to improve the sensitivity of diagnosis at different stages of the disease 52recently some researchers suggested antibody dependent enhancement ade theory to explain the relationship between prior exposure and disease severity or death in some cases according to these studies it has been hypothesized that severely infected sars-cov-2 patients may have been primed by one or more other coronaviruses previously and due to antigenic epitope heterogenicity the elicited antibodies might not completely neutralize the second infection and conversely form complexes with the second virus or virus-activated complement components that interact with the fc or complement receptors on susceptible cells thereby facilitating viral entry 53 54 55 previously ade has been investigated massively in dengue virus 56 57 58 hiv 59 and ebola 53 infections based on sars-cov in vitro studies and mouse models ade dysregulates the immune response provoking cytokine surge lymphopenia and inflammation-based injuries 54 in lung or other parts of the body in severely infected individuals 6061since ade phenomenon requires prior infection to similar antigenic epitopes donnelly ca and co-workers revealed several epitopes on the sars-cov spike protein 62 that were similar but not identical to sars-cov-2 and these epitopes may responsible for ade in covid-19 in convinced with this achievement liu et al discussed earlier during acute phase of sars-cov infection that anti-s-igg modulates macrophage functions by decreasing tgf- production meanwhile promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines which culminating in acute lung injury 63 in another point of view it has been declared some non-neutralizing abs binding non-rbd regions in the s protein may result in an ade of sars-cov infection with harmful immune response 64 notably it has been mentioned that it is not necessary to have experience of a predominant priming virus some other bat coronavirus strains 65 have been identified with higher homology to sars-cov-2 than sars-cov and when individuals were exposed to those viruses it might be considered as a regular common cold virus further researches are needed to exactly discover the mechanism of ade in sars-cov-2 infection and its appropriate role in covid-19 initiation and progression in order to introduce effective viral vaccines or antibody-based therapieschen j et al showed that in an animal model of sars- cov depletion of cd8t cells by the time of infection had not any specific impact on viral clearance or replication but in opposite cd4t cells depletion leads to interstitial pneumonitis which was due to immune system activation and the clearance of virus from the lung environment became time-consuming 70 in addition zhao jm et al exhibited that the main population of inflammatory cells infiltrated to lung were cd8t cells that cause immune-induced lung injury by means of virus killing pathways 71 it has been shown that sars-cov is not able to infect effective t cells but through infecting antigen presenting cells apcs can interfere with t cell priming and migration that in turn leads to declining of virus-specific t cells in the lung 7273despite all efforts that the immune system makes to defeat sars-cov-2 the virus like other known viruses for sure has its own ways to hide or evade from immune system as covid-19 is highly resembled to sars-cov there might be some overlapping mechanisms the most recommended pathways are 1 induction of immune cell apoptosis especially lymphocytes and t cell populations 2 triggering cytokine storm which leads to immune system malfunction besides virus indirect apoptosis of immune mediated cells 3 impairment of antigen presenting pathway and non-optimal t cell activation 4 possible viral mutation tendency especially in mhc-i presentation regions 74 5 changing t cells from immune-activated to immune-exhausted type 75indeed sars-cov-2 acts by establishment of an immune system anarchy which causes devastating sequence of events that end in a dramatic mortalityit has been documented that the uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response mainly exerted by pro-inflammatory cytokines causes vigorous multiple tissue damages and organ failures which finally leads to death in severely infected cases 6976 in consistent with this idea recent report in lancet showed that ards is the major reason of death in covid-19 in fact ards is the common immune-pathologic event for sars-cov-2 by triggering cytokine storm 69 xin et al has been revealed that the cytokine level of il-2 il-6 il-10 and ifn- in severe covid-19 patients reached the highest level during the first week of disease 41 ying xia et al has been evaluated 48 cytokines in plasma samples of 53 covid-19 cases in severemoderate stage and posed that ip-10 mcp-3 and il-1ra had the highest rate which were associated with pao2fao2 40 in a study performed by xiong et al on 19 patients the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 infection has been characterized they analyzed rnas isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf specimens of covid-19 patients and emphasized on the correlation of covid-19 pathogenesis with increased cytokine release such as ccl2mcp-1 cxcl10 ip-10 ccl3 mip-1a and ccl4 mip1b 77 these studies revealed that that the more pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines secreted the more severe disease could be expectedrecently it has been shown that viral load in respiratory tract of clinically ill patients and asymptomatic carriers are almost the same 48 jinya et al exhibited that in covid-19 patients viral load in serum should be considered as a poor prognosis index in critically ill group because by an up to 10 fold increase in il-6 elevation in severe cases it may lead to css and ultimately cause multi-organ failure 78 to support this study wenjun et al analyzed 11 critically ill pneumonia patients with covid-19 and found out 727 individuals suffered from cytokine release syndrome-like crsl they also identified that increased il-6 in pbmc was the leading risk factor for crsl indeed il-6 considered as a primary indicator of crsl in covid-19 patients with pneumonia 79 in total among different studies il-6 has been declared as the most elevated factor that acts as the director of css thus the main question needs to be answered in this subject area is which immune cells or events might be the early driver of massive il-6 secretion neutrophils and netosis have been accused for this catastrophe egeblad et al proposed a vicious cycle of uncontrolled inflammation between nets and macrophages among covid-19 severe cases in which nets amplified macrophages to produce massive il-1 and vice versa moreover they mentioned the capability of neutrophils for shedding soluble il-6r in response to il-8 stimulatory effects that leads to trans-signaling and creation of an uncontrolled-progressive pro- inflammatory state which is a common finding in sars-cov-2 cases 43 eventually css leads to multi-organ failure as an unwanted life-threatening happeningin a non-severe covid-19 patient t cell evaluations have been shown a dramatically increase not only in frequency but also in function especially in activated cd8t cells and in a less degree in activated cd4t lymphocytes on day 7 post infection its interesting that across with this rapid increase of immune cells a vast decline of sars-cov-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction rrt-pcr on the other hand the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines showed no sign of cytokine storm during the symptomatic phase of disease and the cytokine levels showed an inverse model of level changes in contrast to t cells 80in a comparison between severe and moderate covid-19 patients qin et al declared that in severe cases a worse decline in absolute number of cd8 and cd4 t cells along with regulatory t treg cells was observed which was accompanied by decreased ifn- secretion mainly by cd4t cells il-2r il-10 and tnf- were quietly higher in severe cases by the time of admission which brings out the fact of cytokine storm phenomenon direct effects on disease severity 67 it is worth to note that similar to non-severe cases of kedziereska et al study the frequency of hla-drcd8tcells were higher in severe cases of qin et al study they considered this group as a population of treg cells which express ctla-4 and induce suppressing effects on activated t cells 80 this population of t cells was previously introduced by aluvito l et al 81 in another study yong gao et al announced that decreasing cd4t cells is the most significant event in patients with sars-cov-2 which might be related to highly elevated il-6 secretion as a causative agent of t cell death and partial immunodeficiency 39 xin et al has been investigated 40 covid-19 patients severe and mild and declared that during the course of disease there was a sustained dropping in absolute t cell counts especially in cd8 subpopulation and this decline as well as lymphopenia persists even weeks after symptom resolution 41 in a large population of hospitalized patients il-6 il-10 and tnf- were highly over-expressed in icu patients in comparison to non icu cases of covid-19 infected individuals which shows a contrary trend toward t cell count during the course of disease 75yong wen et al showed that in an evaluation of 522 confirmed covid-19 patients who were further divided into icu patients and non icu patients the t lymphocyte population was remarkably lower in icu cases and this decrease showed a worse trend in aged cases interestingly they revealed that in icu admitted group the frequency of tim-3 expressing cd4tcells and pd-1 expressing cd8t cells was much higher than non-icu cases of covid-19 they pointed to the presence of il-10 which is not only responsible for prevention of t cell proliferation but also has a well-accepted role in t cell exhaustion process 75 it has been demonstrated by zheng et al that nk and cd8t cells became functionally exhausted with the increased expression of the inhibitory receptor nkg2a and reduced the ability to express cd107a ifn- il-2 tnf- and granzyme b in covid-19 patients whilst the percentage of nkg2a cytotoxic lymphocytes diminished after patients recovery which presented the role of nkg2a expression in the process of exhaustion and disease progression at early stages 8283 the role of innate immunity and adaptive response has been summarized in fig 1
the main clinical signature in severely infected covid-19 patients is multi-organ failure which ultimately leads to rapid death by creating a complete imbalance in key organ tissues including lungs heart liver and kidneys it has been declared that not only lung tissue but also gastrointestinal tract vascular endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells extensively express ace2 on their surfaces so the organs can be infected by the virus instantly 84 so it is essential to consider clinical investigations of sars-cov-2 in feces samples and the blockade of possible fecal-oral transmission it has also been supposed that covid-19 preliminary attack the lung parenchyma through binding ace2 on host cells leading to intervention of reninangiotensin system ras and then severe interstitial inflammation of the lungs will happen 85previous researches announced that pediatric populations possess strong innate immunity whereas the complement system and adaptive immunity are not mature enough 86 thus it seems that children with effective innate immune system are able to block viral invasion at mucosal level and consequently manifest mild or even asymptomatic features following sars-cov-2 infection on the contrary elderly population lacks effective innate immune system while the complement system is improved in this age remarkably adaptive immune system develops gradually from childhood to adulthood however weakens among elderly 8788 as a result of defective innate immunity and robust complement activation induced by sars-cov aged cases experience a severe progressing pneumonitis 8990 hence acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis hp is more common in aged comparatively healthy adults with normal adaptive immunity regulate inflammatory reactions better and show a sub-acute hp 91 it is worth to mention that aside from handy innate immunity other factors in children are responsible for covid-19 mild or asymptomatic manifestations such as higher lung pneumocyte ace2 proportion to elderlies trained immunity as a presentation of innate memory and higher lymphocyte frequencies specifically nk cells 92another organ that may be affected by covid-19 is liver due to cytokine surge findings show that bile duct epithelial cells derived from hepatocytes stimulate ace2 over-expression in liver tissue through compensatory proliferation that leads to hepatic tissue injury in covid-19 patients with pneumonia 93 fu sheng et al commented that during their evaluation between different studies severe cases especially those admitted to icu liver injury was a more common phenomenon than mild cases the presence of viral rna in blood or stool samples of 210 of covid-19 cases and also expression of ace2 on cholangyocytes were all possible witnesses that liver is one of the organs under covid-19 attack 94 laboratory observations performed by yong gao et al showed markedly liver dysfunction in covid-19 patients by increasing alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast they also found out the levels of troponin i and lactate dehydrogenase ldh were higher in the severe infection 39 moreover the decline level of platelets and longer activated partial thromboplastin time aptt with a jump in creatinine level with renal failure altogether confirmed the extensive devastating effects of multi-organ failure in covid-19 39in addition covid-19 affects cardiovascular system reversely as a result of exacerbated systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression 95 cheng long et al presented that heart pericytes are the main virus target in the heart due to high ace2 expression that leads to capillary endothelial and microvascular malfunction it is interesting that patients with basic heart failure showed an increased rna or protein expression of ace2 which is possibly the main cause of severe problems in this group 96 fox et al have been observed the covid-19 severe cases autopsies and reported valuable cardio-pulmonary findings in lungs they revealed aggregated cd4t cell populations near thrombotic small vessels accompanied with dramatic hemorrhage they defined this phenomenon with the existence of activated cd61 lung resident megakaryocytes which resulted in fibrin deposits and platelet derived clots this group mentioned another finding which was not common between samples degenerated neutrophils and defined it as a possible mirroring of the netosis event within alveolars moreover in their report the abundant rna burden in multinucleated cells that crowded the alveolar space was interpreted as a sign of cellular infection on the other hand cardiac biopsy samples showed a scattered myocyte necrosis without a specific viral induced lymphocytic infiltration 97 taken together these studied are showing that as we are facing a multi-faced disease to find a perfect therapy covid-19 must not be treated as a simple viral infectionbefore finding the best treatment we must meet our urgent needs in estimating of disease severity and patients possible outcome by finding the best prognostic and diagnostic index as previously described the n8r ratio may be one of the possible efforts 41 it has been shown that patients with covid-19 often have lymphocytopenia with or without leukocyte abnormalities according to this study the degree of lymphocytopenia provides a perspective toward disease prognosis due to its positive correlation with disease severity 98 based on clinical reports documented by zhang et al from 82 death cases with sars-cov-2 these patients had neutrophilia 743 lymphopenia 892 and thrombocytopenia 243 upon admission it has also been observed increased neutrophillymphocyte ratio of 5 945 and systemic immune-inflammation index of 500 892 with high level of il-6 c-reactive protein lactate dehydrogenase in all cases they detected 99in another attempt maohua li and colleagues generated covid-19-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against different areas of covid-19 nucleoprotein n through immunization of animals with synthetic peptides characterized antibodies were used for serological diagnostic tools such as immunohistochemistry staining of tissue sections from sars-cov-2 infected patients and sandwich elisa kit that could detect the concentration of virus or np of covid-19 in the vaccine preparations 100 hopefully hongye wang et al provided the sars-cov-2 proteome array to introduce commercial antibodies for sars-cov that can target sars-cov-2 proteins and are suitable for covid-19 researches moreover sars-cov-2 immunogenic epitopes directed igm and igg were profiled in ten covid-19 patients to be applied in diagnostic approaches 101more recently several tests have been developed in many laboratories amanat and co-workers developed sensitive and specific elisa test based on the recombinant full-length s protein and receptor-binding domain rbd epitopes to detect and screen seroconversion just 3 days post covid-19 symptom onset 102 there was no cross-reactivity from other human coronaviruses in their study alongside strong reactivity for iga igm and igg3 probably due to the specificity of s1 antigen for sars-cov-2 diagnosis 103 and highly number epitops found on s protein 102 therefore the sensitivity of the epitopes on which test is performed may be a detemnied factor for the efficient detection of specific antibodies for this reason the sensitivity of two antigens recombinant nucleocapsid protein rn and spike protein rs were compared by liu et al to detect specific antibodies in covid-19 patients collected data revealed that the detection of rs-specific igm was more sensitive in comparison to that of rn-spcific igm possibly due to the higher immunogenicity of the s protein than n protein 104additional effort has been taken by li and collaborations through developing a point-care lateral flow immunoassay lfia test based on the rbd antigen of the sars-cov-2 s1 protein with the ability of igm and igg detection simultaneously within 15 min and higher sensitivity than the individual igg and igm tests nonetheless the limitation of detection was not determined in the test 105chloroquine and hydroxylchloroquine are possibly effective because they may have the ability to prevent releasing virus into cells through increasing endosomal ph and interfering virus-cell fusion it also interferes with virus-receptor binding by blocking glycosylation of sars-cov cellular receptor ace2 110 they also show immunomodulating effect through down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine production based on some clinical trials conducted on chloroquine phosphate it showed sufficient efficacy and safety in the therapeutic management of covid-19 associated pneumonia 111 along with that antiviral therapeutics including lopinavir ritonavir and remdesivir are effective by inhibiting different phases of virus life cycle 112113as an adjunctive therapy azithromycin is applied for prevention of bacterial secondary infection tocilizumab in css cases used as it can put out the inflammation related fire by inhibiting il-6 as a major driver of css 114 these remedies are partially effective in disease control so we need better specific medicationsnovel anti-covid-19 therapies mainly focus on immunomodulation that targets different aspects of innate and adaptive immunity at the front line the most important interventions are virus-entry preventive agents cytokine chemokine and jak-stat inhibitors and blocking of immune-suppressive molecules 115recently li et al have introduced two potential drugs using a protein-protein interaction ppi network containing 125 hub genes of genes co-expressed with ace2 for treatment of sars-cov-2 116 one of them is ikarugamycin discovered as an antibiotic however it is considered in term of an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis 117 regarding it has been revealed that sars-cov gets into host cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis so ikarugamycin may be a choice to treat covid-19 as a result of similarity to sars-cov 118 another drug is molsidomine that is a long-acting vasodilator 119 and also a nitric oxide no donor some literatures showed that inhalation of nitric oxide no can alleviate the sign of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in patients 120 and provide selective vasodilation of the pulmonary circulation to improve oxygenation in patients with sars 121 furthermore no is able to block the replication cycle of sars-cov 122 hence molsidomine is suggested to alleviate the symptoms of covid-19it is proved that ifn-i is produced upon intracellular pathogen invasion two important agents such as dna sensor cyclic gmpamp synthase cgas and its downstream molecule sting stimulator of interferon genes also known as eris mita control transcription of many inflammatory mediators including type i and type iii interferons 123124 deng et al revealed that regulating the upstream of the cytokines production may be a promising approach against covid-19 according to the dysregulated ifn-i production in covid-19 they supposed preventing aberrant activation of cgas-sting pathway through their antagonistic drugs suramin and anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk inhibitors respectively may be helpful in cytokine storm alleviating and treatment of severe lung infection induced by sars-cov-2 given their studies fda approved drugs like suramin and alk inhibitors could be worthful in clinical trials 22 more recently chen et al have reported a sars-cov-2 pneumonia successfully treated by thalidomide combined with low-dose glucocorticoid thalidomide is not only an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent but also relieves anxiety to reduce oxygen consumption lessen vomiting and also lung exudation probably by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels 125further strategy that can be considered for treatment of severe infected covid-19 patients is passive immunotherapy using convalescent plasma cp there are a plenty of ongoing clinical trials for understanding the efficacy of cp therapy around the globe and some of them are summarized in table 1
 although fda eu have announced some guidelines for this type of therapy but the exact concentration and timing is still a matter of debate in a general point of view 200500 ml of cp units mostly through 14 days of disease onset were used in different studies 126 hence it has also been reported that many recovered covid-19 patients donated plasma to severe patients and showed primary favorable results in convince with this study it has been discovered that horse anti-sars-cov serum can surprisingly cross-neutralized sars-cov-2 infections 3 so it can be an expected idea to imply passive immunity to covid-19 through sars antibodies shen et al reported a cp for 5 severe ill patients from recovered cases four patients with no coexisting diseases received convalescent plasma at day 20 and a patient with mitral valve insufficiency and hypertension received the plasma transfusion at day 10 after admission the results showed that the rna of sars-cov-2 was negative between 1 and 12 days after transfusion in respiratory samples besides the clinical symptoms of the cases reduced and their antibody titers raised in a time-dependent manner the specific igg and igm titers increased from day 3 after transfusion and maintained a high level at day 7 post transfusion 127 although the study has some limitations as there was no control group of patients without any interventions administration of convalescent plasma to compare outcomes since it is not possible to determine the true clinical effects of cp on patients moreover patients received various other therapies which made difficult to distinguish the direct effect of the intervention 127in addition developing human single-chain antibodies huscfvs or humanized single-domain antibodies sdab vhvhh which can pass through the membrane of virus-infected cells transbodies and interfere with biological features of virus replication may be another achievement thus exploiting transbodies directed against coronavirus intracellular proteins like papain-like proteases plpro cysteine-like protease 3clpro or other non-structural proteins nsp that are vital for virus replication and transcription can be beneficial approach served as a safe and effective passive immunization for virus exposed individuals or therapeutic agent for infected patients 85 another effort was generating recombinant human monoclonal antibody mab to neutralize sars-cov cr3022 is a sars-cov specific human mab which can bind rbd of sars-cov-2 and may be an effective therapeutics candidate to sars-cov-2 infections 128 other mabs neutralizing sars-cov such as m396 and cr3014 could be plausible for sars-cov-2 treatment 85129 it has been evaluated that m396 and cr3014 failed to bind the s protein of covid-19 representing less similarities between receptor binding domain rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in these cases 85therapeutic agents such as specific antibodies or compounds which neutralize cytokines or their receptors like adalimumab tnf- and cmab806 il-6 22 could be valuable to alleviate host inflammatory responses especially those acting in the lung may improve immune-pathologic effects of covid-19 130 furthermore an in vitro study indicated that anti-cd147 humanized antibody meplazumab can notably neutralize virus and prevent it to infect host cells 7 in addition application of camostat mesylate as an inhibitor of tmprss2 activity should be considered in infected ones 6net suppressing agents also have been suggested as probable therapies inhibitors of net forming molecules such as neutrophil elastase ne peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 pad4 and gasdermin d across with mucosal net digestion by dnase could become useful 43 global efforts for finding new remedies are still an active field and everyday new clinical trial are being registered that some of the important ones are summarized in table 2
taisheng and co-workers have showed that sars-cov specific humoral and cellular immune responses against a pool of predicted highly antigenic peptides derived from different parts of virus structure was detectable even 2 years after recovery in infected cases however during their follow up unfortunately the absolute lymphocyte count did not rise to the normal level so they suggested that immune system impaired permanently or its recovering process is time-consuming 131 in consistence with this study yee-joo et al have been shown that the memory cd8t cells of sars infected cases could detect the virus structural proteins even 11 years after disease 132 counting on these studies and high resemblance of sars-cov-2 to sars-cov in different aspects draws a hopeful landscape for covid-19 vaccine productionahmed et al determined a set of b cell and t cell epitopes derived from the spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins of covid-19 proposed t cell epitopes has been also estimated to be presented by broad ranges of mhc alleles so they can trigger protective response among the globe since these epitopes had no mutation it has been suggested that the identified epitopes could act as potential immune targets in covid-19 vaccination strategies 133it is considered that s protein as an important vital immune-dominant protein of coronaviruses 134 is able to induce protective immunity against sars-cov through involving t-cell responses and neutralizing-antibody production 64 recent findings demonstrated that sars-cov-2 s2 subunit of s protein has a critical role in virus fusion and its entrance into host cells in s2 subunit the heptad repeat 1 hr1 and heptad repeat 2 hr2 are two important domains that interact and form a construction facilitating in virus fusion based on sequence alignment studies s2 subunit is highly conserved between sars-cov and covid-19 with 926 and 100 homology for hr1 and hr2 domain respectively 135 so these domain could consider as important targets to be blocked and thereby prevented viral entry and infection 129as it is known cd8t cells are the most prominent populations associated to protection against covid-19 32 herst cv et al proposed that a covid-19 peptide vaccine designed to activate specific cd8t cells based on the specific epitopes targeted by survivors of documented sars-cov-2 infection could be successfully preventative just like for ebola outbreak 136 adding to this in a most recent study the comparison of t cell subsets between recovered covid-19 cases and healthy individuals revealed an interesting pattern of immunodominancy it has been shown that the virus spike protein which is mainly used for vaccine production can only elicit a small population of responsive cd8t cells therefore an effective vaccine needs other antigens such as derivatives of m nsp6 orf3a n viral particle besides surprisingly in this study the writers reported that 4060 of unexposed cases showed cd4 responses against sars-cov-2 which were made by th1 group they brought up the importance of considering the pre-existence of cross-reactive immunity toward sars-cov-2 infection in vaccine development which might be the result of exposing to common cold coronaviruses according to h1n1 flu experience this pre-formed immune response was correlated with less severity thus this effect might be the incidence of milder response in some of the infected ones as their study population was from non-hospitalized patients and in vaccine production these specific analysis seems to be an obligation 137however due to consideration ethics issues biosafety and technical limitations most of the current attempts were taken from animal model studies and not directly from human subjects more investigations using patient samples are needed to develop promising strategies in vaccination nonetheless generating an effective vaccine and antiviral drug is a priority to control the outbreak of covid-19 infection there are different clinical trials across the world for finding an effective vaccine or anti-viral therapy which is summarized in table2in general point of view sars-cov-2 stimulates almost every aspect of the immune compartment that leads to madness of immune response although a short period of time has passed since the outbreak of sars-cov-2 researchers have learned a lot but there are many aspects of covid-19 immunologic response which are still hidden for us the most important question that needs to be answered is the logic of differences in susceptibility to this virus by finding accurate prognosis factor and enhancing diagnosis methods we can decrease the number of deaths hopefully the first steps for covid-19 treatment and vaccine designating has been taken certainly this virus needs both antiviral and immune-modulatoryregulatory treatments together to become under controlthe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest the authors alone are responsible for the content and writing of the paperthe coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection surprised the world with the spread of a new pandemia spreading itself through over 200 countries and infecting millions of people its main manifestation is a flu-like syndrome that can evolve rapidly into an atypical pneumonia and affect other important systems such as cardiovascular digestive and immune systems 1 2some studies started relating conditions that might increase the risk of developing a fatal course for the disease 3 4 are included diabetes hypertension cardiovascular and coronary diseases and obesity these comorbidities present a large inflammatory component which directly modulates the individuals immune system increasing its vulnerability to the virus 5autism spectrum disorder asd is a brain-based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment in social communication as well as the presence of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests 6 as one of the most frequent and serious neurodevelopmental conditions asd accounts for significant burden in public health with an estimated annual total cost of 250 billion in the united states 7approximately 16 of american children aged 8 years old had an asd and it is estimated an international prevalence of 076 8 9 epidemiology also estimate that more patients are men with the rate of 31 9 there has been a worldwide tendency of increase in asd prevalence in the last few years which could be explained by changes in diagnostic practice coding tendency and community awareness however asd prevalence could be increasing due to changes in true risk factors 10 furthermore data analysis regarding the rise of frequency in this condition should be cautiousthe physiopathology of asd autism spectrum disorder involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level such as the increase of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels 11 some of these modifications are common in the conditions that are considered risk-factor to symptomatic covid-19 and its worse outcome and it is possible to stablish a correlation between themsince asd is a disorders that affects a small but growing and expressive portion of worlds population and the fact that we do not yet fully understand the entire physiopathology of covid-19 we would like with this article bring known data that can support the hypothesis of asd being a risk-factor as the other conditions areclinically the infection and the immune response manifest in two phases initially there is an endogenous immune response which depends on individual health and genetic characteristics which prevents the virus from spreading through organism it is believed that has close relation to specific hla and histocompatibility complex to activate the immunity the response is linked to the destruction level of the virus the patients innate response and it determines its inflammation status and symptomatology 12studies that investigate covid-19 physiopathology demonstrate that there is a second phase of hyper-activation of cytokines known as cytokine storm especially in respiratory epithelium 13 the main cytokines activated are il-1-beta il-6 and tnf-alfa they are related with aggravation of respiratory symptoms particularly severe pneumonia and fatal acute lung injury these cytokines act causing damage to the pulmonary microvasculature while affecting apoptosis and chemotaxis decreasing epithelial barriers and causing alveolar edemaa correlation was also found between a secretory increase of ace-2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and covid-19 patients 14 ace-2 is a regulator in angiotensin-2 transformation into angiotensin-1 2 3 4 5 6 7 metabolite that has pro-inflammatory effects causing vasodilatation anti-proliferation and apoptosis being a common way with cardiovascular diseases 15 in covid-19 infection there seem to exist an ace-2 super-expression leading to a pro-inflammatory state related to cardiac and pulmonary damage 14coronavirus also have neuroinvasive ability presenting as febrile seizures encephalitis convulsions and change in mental status 16 main neurological symptoms found in covid-19 patients are non-specific such as headache dizziness and confusion it is known that neurological symptoms were directly related to the severity of the patients 17 thereby we can hypothesize that its physiopathology might have a strict relation with the nervous systemaccording to wu et al 5 the main factors associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and death were neutrophilia organ dysfunction inflammation and older age neutrophils and inflammation are strictly related due its function of being a source of chemokines and cytokines contributing to the cytokine storm older age contrarywise presents a less vigorous immune response exposing the organism to an inadequate protection against viral destructiona recent study demonstrated that a significant amount of patients about 40 of pneumonia due to covid-19 in the city of wuhan china presented cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases such as diabetes and coronary disease4 they were also more related to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome it is also revealed in the study that male patients are epidemiologically more related to the infection and with the severity of the pathological processthere is a theory that male genetics are more vulnerable thanks to major expression on androgen receptors considered to be primary factors in the genetic transcription of virus proteins spike protein 18 this relationship is also enhanced by the presence of polymorphically relation to an x chromosome-linked inheritance between the loci of androgen receptor genes and ace-2 receptor gene this way it is believed that the hyperandrogenic phenotype is correlated to an increased viral load and viral spread and with the severity of lung involvementbadawi and ryoo had shown in their study that similar respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus have a worse prognostic when associated with hypertension diabetes and obesity 3in diabetes and obesity occurs a chronic activation of neutrophils and macrophages  considering them as chronic inflammatory diseases 19 the increase of natural-killer cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines is related with higher lethality due to sepsis and multiple organ failure there is also a metabolic disfunction associated with glucose glutamine and fats with their less to generate energy to combat acute eventsan additional mechanism causes the decrease of the immune system in these patients a less effective role of lymphocyte b and t in the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response 19 20 it is also common the disfunction of chemotaxis and phagocytosis in the cellular immunity 20coronaviruses have neuroinvasion and neurotropism characteristics also causing demyelination and central nervous system cns inflammation with a possible pathway through the olfactory nerve due to its nasal inoculation 16 17 it is known that viral nervous dissemination is possible due to histopathological alterations in neurons located in cortex and hypothalamus facilitated by proteins dinein and kinesin affecting brain stem areas which regulate the respiratory rhythm 17 this could likewise be found in sars-cov-2 infection although the data in literature are still insufficient to establish an associationasd is a highly heterogeneous disturb presumably with multiple underlying causes ranging from genetic to environmental factors especially those influencing prenatal and early life development 21 congenital infections maternal immune activation and transplacental antibodies likely play an important role in asd physiopathology 22furthermore asd has been correlated with abnormal immune function including cytokine dysregulation inflammation and the presence of autoantibodies several studies have reported the presence of anti-brain immunoglobulins in asd patients 22 asd status could also be directly correlated with patients cytokine and chemokine levels contributing for the chronic pro-inflammatory environment noticed in their organism 23a large amount of patients with asd shares co-occurring medical conditions attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adha is commonly present within these patients as well as others neuropsychiatric conditions such as intellectual disability sleeping problems anxiety irritability language and motor impairments 24 gastrointestinal symptoms are seen in 47 of people with asd 25 epilepsy has a reported prevalence of 8-6 in autistic patients 26 the variety of other clinical conditions which usually affects the immune system as well should be considered when analyzing the role of chronic neuroinflammation among these patientsthe concept of persistent inflammation of the cns among patients with asd and its role in neurodevelopmental outcome has been gaining increasing credibility proliferation of glial cells and subsequent release of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators markedly cytokines and chemokines lead to abnormal immune profiles and altered neural signaling and cognitive function 27immune system dysregulation in asd determines abnormal innate and adaptive immunity responses natural killer nk cells from individuals with asd present higher resting but reduced stimulated cytolytic activity leading to an impaired response following injury stimulus and an excessive baseline level of activity 22regarding humoral adaptive role in asd pathogenesis the presence of brain autoantibodies as well as the correlation between severity of asd and serum antineuronal and anti-ganglioside m1 antibodies sustains the hypothesis of immunoglobulins contribution to neuroinflammation and behavioral changes 28 furthermore shifts in igg into lower affinity classes possibly play an important part in asd manifestations 29numerous studies in animal models established that a maternal immune activation could lead to macrophage inflammatory state up-regulation of interferon-gamma ifn- and systemic deficits of t regulatory cells 27studies suggest an alteration in cytokines profile in patients with asd elevation of prenatal levels of il-1 beta and il-4 could be associated with cognitive development in autistic patients moreover an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 beta il-1 il-5 il-6 il-8 il-12 il-13 il-17 1l-23 and tnf-alfa is often seen in asd patients even in postnatal period 11although uncertain most studies support the theory of an increased th1 response leading to a pro-inflammatory environment in asd 30 repeatedly asd individuals were reported to have lower concentration of anti-inflammatory or higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines however some results are contradictory 28 further studies are necessary to better understand the th1th2 balance among asd patientssome alleles of human leukocyte antigens hla were also associated with asd higher frequencies of hla-drb103 and hla-drb111 were found in asd children this evidence support the theory of autism as an autoimmune disorder leading to chronic neuroinflammation 31people with low-grade chronic inflammation conditions such as diabetes or chronic heart failure are at high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards due to covid-19 this may be explained by a massive inflammatory activation  cytokine storm  facilitated by an already pro-inflammatory environment observed in these conditions 32 this supposition raises the question that patients with asd a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder are at risk of poor outcome in covid-19 the relation of factors is resumed in figure 1
pro-inflammatory cytokines markedly il-6 and il-1 beta are highly increased in patients with ards due to covid-19 33 in effect suppressors of these cytokines such as tocilizumab are been tested as therapeutical weapons among these patients elevated il-beta and il-6 levels are often present in asd patients 11 therefore autistic patients could be at higher risk of developing a cytokine storm due to the already increased levels of the implied cytokinesthe neural pathway of coronavirus through the olfactory nerve 17 could lead to a major immune response on cns leading to an important state of neuroinflammation this state is also seen in asd patients and could be related directly to the organism capacity of defense and to the functionality of the respiratory tractalthough no major mutation has been identified as a genetic etiology for asd epidemiology shows that it is more common in male patients and some genetic syndromes as the fragile x have some clinical resemble 34 straightening the possibility of a correlation with hyperandrogenic phenotype as seen in sars-cov-2 infectionit is important to make a parallel with the vulnerability of the older patients in covid-19 some studies have shown that asd patients present higher levels of viral and bacterial seromarkers as well as increased diagnosis of numerous infections including common cold being also considered more vulnerable especially when they in the first three years of life 35 although the mechanism is yet unclear there can be similarities between the exposure and the risk in both conditionsasd patients present several comorbidities that usually potentialize their inflammatory system even though there are blank spaces in covid-19 physiopathology we know that patients who manifest endogenous inflammation tend to present a worst prognosticgiven the complexity of covid-19 and asd it is possible to notice a coincidence in immune and genetic factors in their physiopathology particularly when it comes to comorbidities considered risk-factor for worse prognostic of the viral infection thus further studies are necessary for the confirmation of this correlationthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papercoronaviruses are common human and mammalian positive-strand rna viruses 1 in december 2019 a new strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified as the pathogenic cause of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of april 21 2020 there were 2397217 confirmed cases of and 162956 deaths from covid-19 worldwide 2although most patients with covid-19 experience only mild-to-moderate disease approximately 15 progress to severe pneumonia and 5 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock andor multiple organ failure which can rapidly lead to death 3 no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments have yet proven effective against covid-19 current clinical management consists of palliative treatments with organ support to moribund patients understanding the immunopathologic mechanism and appropriately targeting the key pathways involved has the potential to minimize pulmonary immune injury and mortalityfollowing infection sars-cov-2 binds to alveolar epithelial cells and activates innate and adaptive immune responses 1 cd4 and cd8 t cells play an important role in balancing the adaptive immune response against pathogens and the potential development of autoimmunity or excessive inflammation 4 activation of cytotoxic cd8 t cells is vital for clearing virus from infected cells but also induces immune injury in tissues 5 on the other hand rapidly activated cd4 t cells become pathogenic t helper 1 cells that generate pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 6 the marked production of cytokines and chemokines leads to recruitment of lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection however a massive release of cytokines can occur as part of a positive feedback loop associated with immune response amplification resulting in cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm 1cytokine storm appears to be a common manifestation in severe covid-19 compared with healthy controls patients with covid-19 experienced elevated plasma levels of interleukin il-1 il-1r il-2

ip-10cxcl10 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 platelet-derived growth factor-bb mip-1 basic fibroblast growth factor tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- and vascular endothelial growth factor 7 furthermore patients admitted to the intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 and tnf- compared with patients who did not require critical care the high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to massive immune cell infiltration of the lungs in patients with covid-19 resulting in alveolar damage decreased lung function and rapid progression to death 78 indeed respiratory failure from ards is the leading cause of mortality associated with covid-19 910among the cytokines implicated in covid-19associated cytokine storm several signal predominantly via the janus kinase jaksignal transducer and activator of transcription stat pathway il-2 il-6 il-7 il-10 ifn- g-csf and gm-csf are dependent on jak1 jak2 or both furthermore ip-10 mcp-1 and mip-1 are ifn- dependent 1112 tnf- has been shown to activate jakstat signaling in a tnf receptor 1dependent manner 1314 these data suggest that jak inhibition

 and there were no detrimental effects on donor engraftment these alloreactive gvhd data are consistent with previous reports suggesting that ruxolitinib has immunomodulatory but not immune-depleting effects 1719data supporting reduction of the cytokine burden has emerged from multiple clinical studies with ruxolitinib mf is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm with progressive cytopenias bone marrow fibrosis and splenomegaly driven by a hyper-inflammatory state 20 plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including ifn- il-6 il-8 il-16 il-18 as well as c-reactive protein intracellular adhesion molecule 1 vascular adhesion molecule 1 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 were significantly higher at baseline in patients with mf compared with healthy controls fig 3a after one cycle of therapy with ruxolitinib 28 days levels of these pro-inflammatory biomarkers decreased fig 3b these changes were not related to jak2 mutational status or disease subtype indicating that the effects of ruxolitinib in patients with mf are reflective of a broad anti-inflammatory effect in addition constitutive phosphorylation of stat3 andor stat5 was observed at baseline in patients with mf and a dose- and time-dependent reduction of phosphorylated stat3 was observed after treatment with ruxolitinib these observations suggest that the dampening of cytokine levels is related to on-target inhibition of jakstat signaling by ruxolitinib at starting doses of 1520 mg bid ruxolitinib resulted in reduced spleen size improvement in mf-related symptoms and improved overall survival in the phase 3 comfort-i and comfort-ii studies of patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk mf 2021 anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequent any-grade and grade 34 adverse events experiencedsr-agvhd is a condition characterized by an allogeneic hyperinflammatory response that can lead to organ damage and death 22 ruxolitinib was approved for sr-agvhd based on the results of the phase 2 reach1 trial 23 ruxolitinib 5 mg bid in combination with corticosteroids resulted in durable responses in this population of patients with poor prognosis proteomics analysis revealed robust changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators after treatment with ruxolitinib and corticosteroids with il-2receptor alpha among the most significantly downregulated proteins 24hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh is another disease with elevation of many pro-inflammatory cytokines eg ifn- il-2 il-6 il-10 il-18 ip-10 mip-1 and tnf- that frequently results in cytokine storm 2526 ruxolitinib 520 mg bid has demonstrated improvement in symptoms and inflammatory markers in the treatment of patients with hlh 26 27 28 in two consecutive patients treated with ruxolitinib rapid reduction in fever was observed 28 in a study of 34 patients with hlh the overall response rate was 735 with a complete response rate of 147 26 in the 25 patients who responded there was a significant reduction in the levels of ifn- il-18 mip-1 and ip-10 in another study of five patients with secondary hlh and two additional patients treated off-protocol 100 achieved a response at the time of the first assessment day 14 with three patients achieving a complete response 27 furthermore hematologic parameters including platelet red blood cell and neutrophil counts improved within the first week of ruxolitinib treatment all patients treated on-protocol also experienced substantial improvements in ferritin and soluble il-2 receptor concentrations at 15 mg bid ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated in this populationthe sudden surge in hospitalization of patients with covid-19 and the high mortality rate of hospitalized patients has encouraged treating physicians to look to repurpose approved drugs to lessen the burden of disease increased understanding of the immunopathology of severe covid-19 6 7 8 has led to the search for drugs that can be effective in controlling the rapid surge in cytokine levels cytokine storms can occur in several infectious and non-infectious sterile conditions and the mechanisms of cytokine storm are conserved irrespective of the triggering event patients with severe covid-19 have similar elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines as patients with hlh 25monoclonal antibodies targeting il-6 are likely to have an impact on the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 given that il-6 is among the cytokines reported to be elevated in those patients compared with healthy individuals at the time of writing antiil-6 antibody products tocilizumab and sarilumab are being evaluated in phase 3 studies 2930 however other cytokines such as il-2 il-7 il-10 ifn- g-csf and gm-csf are also elevated and may be equally or more important in the inflammatory response in patients with severe covid-19 as these cytokines signal through jak1 andor jak2 it is likely that treatment with ruxolitinib will result in broader anti-inflammatory activity than targeting any one of the cytokines alone fig 4
in addition to mf sr-agvhd and hlh noted above jak inhibitors have shown promise in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and ulcerative colitis 31 ruxolitinib was the first jak inhibitor approved in the united states and european union indicated first for mf others have since been approved there are notable differences in selectivity profiles between approved jak inhibitors ruxolitinib is a balanced jak1jak2 inhibitor with good selectivity over non-janus kinases tofacitinib is a pan-jak inhibitor upadacitinib is a jak1 inhibitor and fedratinib is a jak2 inhibitor with activity against flt-kinase and other non-kinase proteins these differences result in distinct biomarker activity profiles singer et al determined gene signatures of four different jak inhibitors in a panel of 12 human primary cell systems and concluded that only ruxolitinib has a biomarker profile that is consistent with broad anti-inflammatory activity 32 these differences in selectivity may in turn be responsible for the differentiated safety profiles for example fedratinib shows a high incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance and cases of wernickes encephalopathy 33 whereas tofacitinib has been associated with an increased risk for lymphomas as well as cardiovascular events in patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor 34 non-melanoma skin cancers and elevated lipid parameters have occurred in patients treated with ruxolitinib 15 dose-dependent and reversible cytopenias have been commonly observed with ruxolitinib treatment in patients with mf pv and gvhd 1520213536 use of ruxolitinib has also been associated with viral reactivation including cytomegalovirus and herpes zoster virus 1535 suggesting the potential for an increase in infections with ruxolitinib treatmentthe pharmacokinetic profile of ruxolitinib is characterized by rapid oral absorption and a short terminal elimination half-life of approximately 3 h fig 5a as well as a concentration-dependent and reversible pharmacodynamic effect fig 5b 37 this profile is in contrast with that of antibodies such as tocilizumab which has a half-life of approximately 2 weeks 38 and other jak inhibitors such as fedratinib which has a half-life of 6278 h 39 thus ruxolitinib is more conducive to short-term therapy and withdrawal as needed based on the similarity of the reported elevation of cytokine levels in covid-19 to hlh and mf dose ranges of 5 to 15 mg bid may result in adequate inhibition of cytokine signaling while minimizing adverse events furthermore it is anticipated that patients would receive ruxolitinib for approximately 14 days a brief time period that should minimize the risk of long-term infection or other complications such as severe cytopenias although preclinical models and clinical data show a lack of any impact on t-cell function and immune response with ruxolitinib treatment at pharmacologically relevant doses 171940 it would be prudent to both select patients who are likely to develop cytokine storm based on evolving clinical criteria such as h-score and to identify the best time to initiate treatment based on onset of symptoms and other clinical indicators such as respiratory distress or the need for supplemental oxygentaken together these data suggest that ruxolitinib at pharmacologically achievable doses may be able to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state observed in patients experiencing covid-19associated cytokine storm indeed early clinical evidence supports this premise a team in northern italy has reported on the use of ruxolitinib in four of their hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen with clinical improvement seen in all four patients 41 furthermore emerging data from ongoing investigator-initiated trials suggest a potential benefit of ruxolitinib with a manageable adverse event profile 42 43 44 45 in a randomized trial of 43 patients in wuhan china patients treated with ruxolitinib had a numerically shorter time to clinical improvement compared with those treated with standard of care median 12 vs 15 days and better outcome for survival 0 vs 3 deaths in the control arm 42 importantly although higher rates of grade 12 anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed with ruxolitinib in this study there was no increase in grade 34 cytopenias and patients receiving ruxolitinib experienced a significantly shorter time to improvement of lymphopenia compared with standard of care median 5 vs 8 days hazard ratio 3307 95 ci 1097 to 8409 p  033 additionally no increase in infections was seen with ruxolitinib treatment in these patientsthese encouraging early clinical results combined with a thorough understanding of the evidence supporting the posited mechanism of action of ruxolitinib in covid-19associated cytokine storm and the urgent need for treatments in patients with severe disease support expedited investigation of ruxolitinib for patients with covid-19 in phase 3 clinical trialsthis work was supported by incyte research institute incyte corporation wilmington de usa the authors as employees of the sponsor were

not been previously found in humans on february 11 2020 the world health organization who named it as 2019 coronavirus disease and its english name was corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 since december 2019 a number of pneumonia patients with covid-19 infection have been found in wuhan hubei province china with the spread of the epidemic such cases have also been found in other parts of china and worldwide at present most of the reported cases have a history of residence or travel in wuhan and no case of travel history in wuhan has been found in some areas ncp is officially declared a public health emergencies of international concern pheic on january 30 2020 by who ncp has been included in the class b infectious diseases stipulated in the law of the peoples republic of china on prevention and control of infectious diseases simultaneously prevention and control measures for class a infectious diseases are taken and implemented in china as of 10 am on may 3 2020 a total of 84393 cases have been confirmed 78939 cases have been cured and 4643 cases have died with a mortality rate of 550 ncp has spread all over the world and posed a major threat to human health there is no vaccine or specific effective drugs for covid-19 infected pneumonia at present on march 5 2020 the national health commission of the peoples republic of china issued the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov infection trial version 7 which integrated traditional chinese medicine tcm into the treatment of covid-19 the therapeutic schedule is mainly isolation treatment and symptomatic support treatmenttraditional chinese medicine is a great treasure house of china and it has unique advantages in the treatment of viral infectious diseases covid-19 which belongs to the category of pestilence and epidemic disease in tcm has the pathogenesis characteristics of dampness poison blood stasis and closure and presents the syndrome of dampness poisoning heat and poisoning lung collaterals in the progressive stage of pneumonia 1 the theory of syndrome differentiation characterized by defensive energy nutrients and blood shows its unique advantages in guiding the clinical prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases with unknown characteristics and strong infectivity it provides an effective treatment scheme for infectious diseases such as sars h1n1 h7n9 and has been internationally recognized 24 viral infectious disease is called epidemic disease in tcm it is an acute febrile disease caused by pathogenic qi disease invading the human body through mouth nose or muscle surface it belongs to the category of febrile disease tcm emphasizes the overall concept syndrome differentiation and treatment which can not only be treated but also can be prevented especially in the improvement of body symptoms which has unique advantages in the novel coronavirus campaign tcm is playing a new therapeutic role in different stages of ncp that is supporting the healthy and eliminating the evil and keeping the same strain syndrome differentiation and treatment to change strain restraining cytokine storm and controlling the serious development of the disease reducing the sequelae caused by hormones and other drugs decreasing the fatality rate of patients and so on the strategy of tcm is added to the main battlefield of anti-epidemic is implemented and the clinical curative effect of the existing chinese medicine preparation or decoction is observed currently the conventional treatment plus tcm plan has been integrated and published forming a unified highly directive and practical integrative medicine for the prevention and treatment of ncpat present covid-19 serves as the pathogenic mechanism of ncp has not been fully revealed inhibiting virus proliferation in host cells and reducing host system response is considered to be an important way to alleviate viral infectious diseases as a -coronavirus covid-19 has more than 85 homology with sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and coronavirus 3cl mpro on host epithelial cells affected by its s-protein are considered to be the core targets for inhibiting virus proliferation 5 simultaneously cytokine storm induced by virus is the main cause of inflammation septic shock and multiple organ failure 6in this research we summarized the pharmacological action mechanism of action and clinical application of qingwen baidu decoction qbd and analyzed its characteristics and advantages of clinical application thus this study will provide theoretical basis and practical reference for its clinical application in anti-ncp and other diseasesqingwen baidu decoction which originated from a view of epidemic febrile diseases with rashes yi zhen yi de named in chinese in the qing dynasty 7 was created by shiyu yu a famous febrile pathologist in the qing dynasty the original prescription of qbd was made from baihu decoction antidotal decoction of coptis and decoction of rhinoceros horn and rehmannia including gypsum fibrosum rehmanniae radix rhinoceros nicornis lrsimus burchell gardeniae fructus platycodonis radix coptidis rhizoma scutellariae radix anemarrhenae rhizoma paeoniae radix rubra scrophulariae radix forsythiae fructus lophatheri herba glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma and moutan cortex which has the effect of clearing heat and cooling blood alleviating heat-producing and disintoxicating it is one of the most representative anti-epidemic agents in tcm 8 9 clinical evidence suggests that qbd can be used in the treatment of a variety of viral infectious diseases which can relieve symptoms with a good clinical effect pharmacological studies show that the antiviral effect of qbd is mainly associated with gardeniae fructus coptidis rhizoma scutellariae radix and scrophulariae radix which have obvious inhibitory effect on many kinds of influenza viruses via repressing virus replication and preventing virus from entering cells at the same time rehmanniae radix and anemarrhenae rhizoma can significantly regulate cellular and humoral immune function enhance the activity of immune system and reduce the expression of inflammatory factors 10clinically patients with high fever accompanied by extreme thirst headache dysphoria delirium red tongue and scorched lips it is syndrome of flaring heat in qifen and xuefen which is difficult to treat it is common in pneumonia septicemia sepsis infectious mononucleosis and so on in modern medicine among them sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the bodys dysfunctional response to infection 1113 qbd has effects on relieving sepsis fever inhibiting early inflammatory reaction improving blood coagulation dysfunction and reducing organ function damage also effectively improving patients clinical symptoms ameliorating patients prognosis and so on 1416 nowadays extensive studies have shown that qbd combined with conventional therapy in the treatment of sepsis can effectively ameliorate the clinical symptoms of patients reduce or inhibit systemic inflammatory reaction protect the function of various organs and systems and improve the prognosis of patients conventional therapy combined with qbd in the treatment of sepsis syndrome of flaring heat in qifen and xuefen has effects on reducing the serum immunological indexes such as igg iga igm c3 crp and tnf- reducing acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii score as well as improving the effective rate of clinical treatment with good clinical effect which is worth popularizing in clinical 17 18a prospective randomized controlled study was used to observe and evaluate the clinical effect of qbd on blood coagulation indexes and tcm clinical symptom scores in patients with sepsis with blood coagulation dysfunction the results indicate that qbd can increase the total clinical effective rate of patients with sepsis coagulation dysfunction from 742 of the basic treatment to 939 also qbd can also significantly decrease the tcm clinical symptom score apache ii score and sequential sepsis-related organ failure assessment sofa these results indicate that qbd combined with routine treatment can significantly improve the clinical symptoms and blood coagulation function indexes of sepsis patients ameliorate patients health status and protect internal organs 19 xi et al 20 used qbd plus routine treatment to investigate its effect on patients with sepsis with pathogen invading lung defense syndrome the apache ii score c-reactive protein crp white blood cell wbc count tcm syndrome score blood glucose and antipyretic time were significantly improved in the integrated group and there was no obvious manifestation of organ failure it shows that qbd can significantly improve the clinical symptoms and shorten the course of disease lin et al 21 established sepsis model in rats by cecal ligation and puncture clp it was found that the mechanism of qbd in treating sepsis was related to regulating the expression of genes related to il-17 signal pathway in rat spleen yi et al 22 established sepsis model by intravenous injection of colibacillus endotoxin into rabbit ear vein it was found that qbd reduced systemic inflammation in septic rabbits by regulating tlr4nf-b signalling pathway wang et al 23 found that the physiological and pathological conditions of septic acute lung injury ali in qbd rats were significantly better than those of the model group including pathological injury pathological score respiratory function mental state and mortality etc and the expressions of jak2 p-jak2 stat3 p-stat3 ikk and nf-bp65 protein in lung tissue of rats in qbd group were significantly down-regulated it is suggested that qbd can exert its protective effect by inhibiting the continuous activation of jak2stat3 and ikknf-b pathway and its down-regulating effect is significantly related to the improvement of physiological and pathological conditions in rats with ali in addition it can effectively inhibit the lung tissue inflammatory factors tnf- il-1 il-6 and its mediated jak2stat3 signal pathway in septic ali rats in addition qbd could improve the negative feedback regulation mechanism of this pathway and have a protective effect on ali model rats 24 the effects of qbd on lung pathology and the expression of nuclear factor-bp65 nf-bp65 in rats with ali induced by lipopolysaccharide lps were observed to explore the therapeutic effect and intervention mechanism of qbd on ali the results showed that qbd could reduce the degree of lung injury induced by lps in ali rats the accumulation infiltration and exudation of inflammatory cells in the lungs to a certain extent playing a definite role in lung protection qbd can effectively reduce the expression of nf-bp65 in the lung tissue of ali rats induced by lps it could reduce the cascade reaction of inflammation by inhibiting the activation of nf-b and the production of inflammatory cytokines as well as inhibiting the inflammatory reaction the use of qbd in the early stage of ali induced by lps can effectively reduce the injury course of lung tissue and the inflammatory reaction as well as preventing the occurrence and development of inflammation 25li et al 26 investigated the potential mechanism of qbd in treating the fever period of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs the results showed that qbd combined with conventional therapy was significantly superior to routine therapy in the treatment of hfrs and the former shows its effects on the regulation of cell immune function and the improvement of the hfrs symptoms by detecting the level of cd4 and cd8 cells cd4cd8 ratio and the concentration of tnf- and il-10 in lymphocyte the authors found that the prescription could significantly change the clinical symptoms and the integrated methods was better than that conventional therapy used alone according to the different stages of epidemic hemorrhagic fever patients according to the different stages of epidemic hemorrhagic fever patients hao et al 27 combined conventional therapy with the application of qbd for treatment the results show that the therapeutic effect of integrated strategy is significant with no adverse reactionsqin et al 28 treated four cases of meningococcal meningitis mainly by oral qbd supplemented by antibiotics all of them were cured and the course of treatment was shortened sun et al 29 treated 62 patients with epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis with qbd the results showed that 58 cases were cured 3 cases were significantly improved and 1 case was ineffectiveon the basis of routine treatment qbd plus subtraction retention enema increased the cure rate of infantile pneumonia from 814 to 9762 which significantly improved the clinical effect of the patients 30through the intervention of qbd the relationship between tlr4 cytokines and inflammatory mediators in sae rats induced by clp was observed the results showed that qbd could inhibit the number of wbc the percentage of neutrophils ne tnf- il-6 leukotriene b4 ltb4 and the content of tlr4 positive cells in brain tissue of rats with sepsis-related encephalopathy qbd can reduce the excessive inflammatory response and regulate the immune response in sepsis-related encephalopathy rats through its anti-inflammatory factors tnf- il-6 and tlb4 and regulating the expression of tlr4-mediated inflammatory signal pathway indicating that qbd can improve the neurological function and inflammatory response of sepsis-related encephalopathy rats 31hong 32 found that qbd plus rhei radix et rhizoma combined with conventional therapy had obvious advantages over conventional therapy used alone in the treatment of epidemic encephalitis b in children yang et al 33 treated 16 cases of epidemic encephalitis b with oral qbd the results showed that the effect of qbd was good and the total effective rate was 875by dynamically observing the effect of qbd on the expression of serum cytokines tnf- il-8 and il-10 in rats with ali induced by non-invasive instillation of endotoxin lps 2 mgkg solution through larynx he et al 34 found that qbd could regulate the imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors during ali alleviate pulmonary inflammatory injury and thus protect lung tissue wang et al 35 36 also found that qbd can effectively regulate the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines il-1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines il-13 in blood of rats with ali induced by lps promote the dynamic balance of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines reduce the total number of white blood cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid improve alveolar injury inflammatory cell infiltration and erythrocyte exudation etc thereby reducing inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung it can repair and protect the injured lung tissue oral or nasal feeding with qbd on the basis of conventional treatment can reduce the expression levels of tnf- il-1 il-6 and il-10 in patients with septic acute renal injury inhibiting excessive inflammation and delaying renal injury 37wang et al 35 observed the effect of qbd on the level of serum inflammatory factors in rats with ali and found that it can effectively regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines il-1 and il-13 to achieve a dynamic balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines repair and protect the injured lung tissue wu et al 38 observed the anti-inflammatory effects of paeonol and geniposide by increasing celiac capillary permeability and foot swelling test in mice the results showed that both paeonol and geniposide had obvious anti-inflammatory effects these results indicate that the anti-inflammatory effect of qbd is closely related to the anti-inflammatory effect of moutan cortex and gardeniae fructus in the prescriptionshi et al 39 used gardeniae fructus extract for detecting the expression of vp16 mrna and ifn- in the brain of mice infected with herpes simplex virus type i in vivo they found that gardeniae fructus extract could inhibit the replication of herpes simplex virus in the brain of mice therefore it can be known that qbd has significant antiviral effect which is related to the large doses of forsythiae fructus scutellariae radix and gardeniae fructus and so on by observing the efficacy of qbd in the treatment of h1n1 influenza virus pneumonia the results showed that the total effective rate of qbd treatment group 960 was significantly higher than that of the control group 700 and the serum levels of tnf- il-6 il-8 and crp in the qbd were lower than those in the control group while the level of il-10 was higher than that in the control group it was effective in the treatment of h1n1 influenza a complicated with respiratory distress syndrome it shows that qbd can reduce the inflammatory reaction and improve the symptoms of patients which is of great significance in the prevention and treatment of influenza a h1n1 viral pneumonia tcm not only has the effect of multi-link anti-influenza a virus but also can adjust the immune state of the body improve the antiviral ability enhance the stability of the tissue itself reduce the excessive inflammatory reaction of the body and protect the cell tissue qbd plays a significant role in reducing fever reducing temperature relieving cough and removing phlegm improving symptoms and other effects and its curative effect is easy for patients to accept which reflects the advantages of tcm compound prescription in the treatment of multi-pathway multi-link and multi-target and is of great significance to effectively control the epidemic situation of influenza a h1n1 15 40the clinical observation of qbd combined with ganciclovir in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis im caused by epsteinbarr virus infection showed that the total effective rate of the combined group was 9348 significantly higher than that of the control group 8000 and the effect was more obvious 41 the curative effect was more obvious and the time of fever pharyngitis and enlargement of liver and spleen lymph nodes in the qbd group was significantly shortened the time for the total number of wbc abnormal lymphocytes and liver function to return to normal was significantly shortened indicating that qbd is effective in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis in children 42to study the clinical efficacy of colon infusion of qbd in the treatment of severe entero virus 71 ev71 infection the control group was treated with routine therapy and the experimental group was treated with routine therapy combined with colon drip of qbd the number of advanced cases in the experimental group was significantly reduced and the time of fever regression and hospitalization in the experimental group was significantly shorter than that in the control group the results show that qbd colonic drip is effective in the treatment of ev71 infection it is worth popularizing for early antipyretic and preventing disease progression 43shen et al 44 infected mice by adenovirus adv3 and influenza virus fm1 then mice were treated with different concentrations of scutellariae radix and forsythiae fructus water extract it was found that both of them could significantly reduce the mortality of mice infected with the two viruses indicating that their antiviral effect was significant the effect of gardeniae fructus should not be ignored though served as an adjuvant in this prescriptionin addition qbd has the effects of antipyretic anti-inflammatory antibacterial and antiviral it can shorten the antipyretic time in the treatment of sars and no adverse reactions are found so it can be used as an antiviral adjuvant in clinic 45yu 46 used coptidis rhizoma to treat the skin model of bacterial and fungal infection in japanese white rabbits and the results showed that it had a strong antibacterial effect zhu et al 47 found that coptidis rhizoma and its different processed products had obvious bacteriostatic effect han et al 48 used the different extracts of anemarrhenae rhizoma to test the bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus shigella dysenteriae pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli in vitro the results showed that sarsasapogenin in the extract had the strongest antibacterial activity the coptidis rhizoma also has significant antibacterial activity in vitro liu et al 49 used qbd water extract to inhibit escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro the results showed that it had inhibitory effect on two kinds of enzyme-producing bacteria therefore it is speculated that the antibacterial effect of qbd may be exerted through the combination of the above drugsusing qbd to treat rats with summer heat syndrome of febrile disease the levels of il-2 il-6 and il-18 in the large dose qbd group and the il-10 level in the low dose qbd group were higher than those in the lps control group and the levels of il-2 and il-18 in the high dose qbd were higher than those in the low dose qbd group qbd can increase the levels of il-2 il-6 il-10 and il-18 in the rat model of heatheat syndrome of febrile disease which may have the effect of immune enhancement 50 zhang et al 51 observed the changes of igg iga igm crp tnf- and c3 in peripheral venous blood of patients with sepsis before and after treatment with qbd the results showed that qbd could inhibit the excessive immune response of patients and reduce its damage to the body moutan cortex is reused in qbd and its main active ingredient paeonol has the effect of regulating immunity adding qbd on the basis of routine treatment of western medicine can improve the clinical curative effect of patients with sepsis from 7500 to 8400 reduce the symptom score of tcm and the levels of igg iga igm c3 crp and tnf- inhibit the excessive immune response of septic patients and reduce the damage of excessive immune response to the body 52zhang et al 53 through intraperitoneal injection of 5 chicken erythrocyte suspension and intragastric administration of paeonol of different concentrations finally they found that paeonol could enhance the specific humoral and cellular immune function of mice fu et al 54 treated 18 patients with sepsis by qbd and detected the peripheral blood prothrombin time activated partial thromboplastin time thrombin time and platelet count before and after treatment the results showed that the prescription can improve the blood coagulation function of patients with sepsis and play a protective role in patients with sepsiswang et al 55 observed the clinical efficacy of qbd in the treatment of high fever and found that the total effective rate of qbd in the treatment of high fever 923 was significantly higher than that in the control group of angong niuhuang pill 5769 the clinical effect was satisfactory wang et al 56 studied the changes of body temperature in the fever model of rats and mice induced by dry yeast endotoxin and 24-dinitrophenol and found that yuanshen can reduce the fever temperature of rats and mice within 48 h after the fever it is inferred that the antipyretic effect of qbd may be played by gypsum fibrosum scutellariae radix forsythiae fructus and so on li et al 57 induced fever in rats by subcutaneous injection of yeast solution intragastric administration of different doses of baicalin solvent detected body temperature in different periods of time and found that its antipyretic effect was significant yu et al 58 induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome in rabbit by injecting lps into ear vein after intragastric administration of different doses of gypsum fibrosum the anal temperature was measured and it was found that qbd had obvious antipyretic effect hu et al 59 used different extracts of fructus forsythiae shell and seed to observe the neutralization effect on fever of rabbit ear swelling of mouse and endotoxin the results showed that the antipyretic effect of the extracts was obviousin qbd the sovereign drug is gypsum fibrosum and its main active ingredient is hydrous calcium sulfate rehmanniae radix is a minister drug which mainly contains rehmannia glycoside catalpol and so on the adjuvants are coptidis rhizoma scutellariae radix anemarrhenae rhizoma scrophulariae radix gardeniae fructus etc coptidis rhizoma mainly contains berberine scutellariae radix contains a lot of baicalin the main active ingredients of anemarrhenae rhizoma are sarsasapogenin scrophulariae radix contains paeonol gardeniae fructu mainly contains geniposide and geniposide paeoniae radix rubra mainly contains paeoniflorin etc the main components of forsythiae fructus are phillyrin and forsythoside rhinoceros nicornis lrsimus burchell mainly contains cholesterol and so on pentacyclic triterpenoid glycosides are the main active components of platycodonis radix and the effective components of moutan cortex are paeonol and paeoniflorin the conductant drug of this prescription are fresh lophatheri herba and glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma which contain flavonoids glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid respectively 60gypsum fibrosum and rhinoceros nicornis lrsimus burchell powder are commonly used and effective antipyretic in tcm scutellariae radix forsythiae fructus scrophulariae radix and gardeniae fructus can not only assist the main drug in heat-clearing and detoxification but also have direct antiviral effects confirmed by modern pharmacological studies tcm believes that superheat consuming qi and consumption of yin caused by febrile diseases thus both heat-clearing and detoxification and replenishing qi and nourishing yin should be taken into accounts in treatment astragali radix radix et rhizoma anemarrhenae rhizoma and rehmanniae radix were added to the original prescription while astragali radix can achieve indirect antiviral effect by regulating the immune function of the body 45through the analysis of the compatibility of disassembled prescriptions and the parallel comparison of multiple indexes ding et al 61 selected the effective ingredient of qbd to clear away heat and purge fire and made it clear that the effective component of qbd in interfering with endotoxic ali in rats was crocin-1studies have shown that lps or endotoxin were mainly used to establish ali model of rats moreover endotoxin of escherichia coli was used to establish sepsis models in new zealand rabbit these studies mainly investigated the influence of qbd on ali sepsis or sae model in terms of lung histopathology wd ratio wbc level pao2 level paco2 level and other indicators the specific details of disease types animal types experimental model does of qbd medical effects in qbd group and targets are shown in table 1 notably the relevant research of qbd is mainly focused on clinical research in clinical the therapeutic effects of qbd on sepsis viral pneumonia caused by influenza a virus subtype h1n1 sars hyperthermia and other diseases were discussed by collecting clinical cases in general qbd combined with conventional therapy can significantly improve the clinical treatment efficiency of these diseases the reported indicators in qbd group are shown in table 2the effect of qbd on lung histopathology was mainly reported in animal experiments he et al 34 found that the alveoli space of lps induced-ali rats became narrow with reduced swelling of capillary endothelial cells and the bleeding and exudation of edema fluid were significantly improved in qbd group wang et al 25 found that qbd can reduce the damage degree of ali rats lung tissue and can reduce the aggregation infiltration and exudation of inflammatory cells in the lung tissue so as to play a more obvious role in protecting the lung tissue qbd can effectively decrease the relative protein expression of nf-b p65 in ali rats induced by lps by inhibiting the activation of nf-b and the production of inflammatory cytokines the inflammatory response of rat lung tissue can be reduced early application of qbd can effectively reduce the degree of lung injury and the inflammatory response of alveoli zhang et al 62 found that qbd reduced the degree of congestion and edema of pulmonary interstitium and alveoli and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells wang et al 24 used endotoxin to establish sepsis ali the results indicated that pathological type ii alveolar cell injury score of observation data significantly reduced in qbd group in addition qbd could significantly alleviate the alveolar pathological damage in endotoxin-induced ali in rats the results showed that the alveolar structure of qbd group was relatively complete and the consolidation of alveoli infiltration of inflammatory cells and edema in alveoli were alleviated in varying degreesali is a syndrome caused by severe infection trauma and shock which is characterized by diffuse high permeability pulmonary edema and parenchymal cell injury it is a serious complication in the early stage of sepsis in essence the disease is an out of control systemic self-destructive inflammatory response previous studies have shown that qbd can reduce wbc pmns wd ratio pao2 and paco2 levels of lps-induced ali 24 25 31 3436 6163 it was found that the pharmacodynamics of qbd was mainly related to the regulation of il-8 il-10 and tnf- levels 34 pathway study showed that qbd could significantly reduce the over activation of nf-b p65 jak2stat3 and p38 mapk signaling pathway 25 63 simultaneously qbd can decrease the degree of lung inflammation and injury and the over release of inflammatory factors in ali ratsqbd can be used in the treatment of sepsis influenza a h1n1 virus pneumonia sars pneumonia and erythroderma psoriasis and so on among which the treatment of sepsis is the most reported table 2 most of the collected clinical cases were treated with conventional therapy combined with qbd the course of treatment was generally about 7 days which could significantly improve the clinical efficiency for the treatment of sepsis the influence of qbd on the apache ii score tcm symptom score serum immunology index serum pt aptt tt and plt values mortality and safety of the patients was focused as sepsis patients have obvious immune dysfunction qbd can play a role in treating sepsis by regulating the immunological index and the clinical effect is better than that of the conventional treatment group relevant detection indicators of other diseases are shown in table 2ncp is mainly characterized by pneumonia fever cough fatigue and gradually dyspnea a few patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea currently novel coronavirus infection has not been confirmed effective specific antiviral drugs from the outbreak of sars in 2003 and mers in 2018 to the recent outbreak of covid-19 clinicians and scientists have provided several potentially effective antiviral drugs for clinical use including remdesivir lopinavirritonavir convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies however the specific efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with covid-19 still need further clinical trialsmodern pharmacological studies have found that qbd has significant pharmacological activities in antiviral regulating immune function inhibiting inflammation improving vomiting and diarrhea from the theory of tcm to modern clinical and pharmacological studies it has been shown that qbd combined with modern medical conventional treatment has therapeutic effect on viral infection related diseases and its mechanism includes inhibition of virus infection related inflammation and improvement of disease-related symptoms qbd has therapeutic effect on a variety of virus influenza virus h1n1 sars virus ev 71 etc infection 40 43 45 it is a clinical goal for the body to remove the virus from the bodys immune system pharmacological studies show that qbd and its components have significant anti-inflammatory effects which can inhibit inflammatory exudation reduce the levels of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines il-10 and regulate the inflammatory related nf-bp65 jak2stat3 tlr4 pathways it is suggested that ncp can alleviate inflammation in qbd protect organs from inflammation and slow down the progress of inflammation in addition qbd could improve the symptoms of fever and diarrhea associated with viral infection suggesting that qbd may also improve the symptoms of new crown pneumonia the pharmacological effect and multi-target mechanism of qbd in the treatment of various diseases are shown in fig 1the inflammation caused by virus infection can promote the clearance of invading virus and return to normal under negative feedback regulation after virus clearance however excessive inflammatory reaction can lead to more serious damage to the body than the virus infection itself and in some cases even lead to the imbalance of immune regulation the lack of negative feedback and the continuous amplification of positive feedback and the abnormal increase of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in a storm of cytokines which eventually leads to organ damage functional failure and even death covid-19 patients also experienced a cytokine storm and related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in the absence of a specific drug for covid-19 the clinical goal is to support the treatment and control of inflammation and let the body immune system clear the virusthe pathogenesis of covid-19 is not clear it may be related to the damage of immunity and respiratory epithelial cells caused by covid-19 and the susceptibility of the body but regardless of the pathogenesis it is reported that there is overexpression of inflammatory factors in patients with advanced covid-19 which leads to cytokine storm 70 cytokine storm is considered to be an important factor in the development of viral pneumonia the roles of cytokines in immune network in promoting disease progression inducing local inflammation eliminating infection regulating cellular and molecular immune response and regulating tissue repair are very complex 71 when the immune system is out of balance and cytokines are overexpressed there will be a cytokine storm which will cause serious damage to the body such as diffuse alveolar injury hyaline membrane formation fibrin exudation etc at the same time accelerated lung injury the emergence of more serious pulmonary capillary injury and damage to the immune function of the body cytokines in the circulatory system will lead to systemic cytokine storm further lead to systemic organ dysfunction accompanied by the overexpression of inflammatory factors such as ifn tnf il and so on regulating the immune balance in the state of covid19 and inhibiting the occurrence of cytokine storm will be an important way and mechanism to block the deterioration of the diseaseoverall qbd has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on exogenous diseases related to viral infection from the theory of tcm to modern clinical and pharmacological studies qbd and its basic prescription exert the effect of detoxifying and cooling blood and play a significant therapeutic effect on a variety of viral infections eb virus h1n1 influenza virus sars virus ev71 etc it may be related to the systematic regulation of inhibition of virus proliferation in the host and excessive expression of host inflammatory response and is expected to be used in the treatment of severe pneumonia in covid-19 the specific mechanism of its curative effect may be closely related to the inhibition of covid-19 invasion into the host for proliferation and the improvement of cytokine storm the replication cycle of animal virus infection has similarity with the joint efforts of colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry it has been found that a number of drugs developed for other viruses can inhibit covid-19 in vitro 72 73 based on the pharmacological effects of qbd such as antipyretic antibacterial antiviral anti-inflammatory regulating immunity and so on it is commonly used in clinical treatment of infectious diseases such as sepsis epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis epidemic hemorrhagic fever epidemic encephalitis b and so on with remarkable curative effect not easy to relapse and little side effect as far as the material basis of the prescription is concerned the future research should not be limited to the application of the whole prescription but should be flexibly applied the relevant components and contents can be added or decreased according to the disease and the combination of tcm and western medicine should be adheredqbd has a dual regulatory effect on immune function through the regulation of immunity to achieve the purpose of anti-infection and anti-inflammation 74 the combination of heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs and drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis can enhance the non-specific anti-infective effect of the former 75 modern experimental studies have found that qbd has some pharmacological effects such as heat-clearing and detoxification anti-platelet aggregation reducing blood viscosity anti-inflammation analgesia sedation antibacterial antiviral liver protection cardiotonic diuretic and so on 76 all the heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs such as anemarrhenae rhizoma gypsum fibrosum scrophulariae radix forsythiae fructus coptidis rhizoma have certain antiviral ability which can remove the virus or inhibit its replication and reduce the inflammatory damage of the virus forsythiae fructus can stimulate mononuclear macrophage system enhance phagocytosis and promote antibody production scrophulariae radix can prolong the existence time of antibody scutellariae radix can enhance leukocyte phagocytosis promote lymphocyte transformation and improve immune function drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis such as paeoniae radix rubra and moutan cortex can not only inhibit cellular immunity and possibly inhibit the extensive toxic effect of t cells so as to reduce multiple organ damage but also promote non-specific immunity antivirus regulate immunity and so on 7782 moutan cortex cool blood and dissipate blood stasis rash clear camp diathermy to nourish yin scutellariae radix glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma gardeniae fructus have effect on protecting liver function and forsythia forsythiae fructus scutellariae radix and lophatheri herba can promote the excretion of endotoxin and virus all kinds of medicines are compatible clearing heat and detoxification activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis replenishing qi and nourishing yin and by regulating immunity and other effects of antivirus antipyretic detoxification and liver protection so as to achieve the purpose of treatment it is suggested that qbd can reduce the inflammatory reaction of covid-19 patients and may have a protective effect on organ damage caused by inflammation although there is no complete data on the treatment of covid-19 by qbd it is believed that in the near future the tcm and modern medicine can achieve positive clinical treatment effect and reduce the suffering of patients improve prognosis and rehabilitationin this fight against ncp tcm has shown its unique advantages in reducing mortality and improving cure rate 83 84 notably tcm also pays attention to three elements in the treatment of diseases first the climate environment now people are paying attention to the relationship between the climate humidity and temperature on the epidemic situation which is a common problem second we should attach importance to special disease and specific prescription and syndrome differentiation and treatment third we should attach importance to peoples constitution although qbd can be used in the treatment of a variety of viral infectious diseases and alleviates the symptoms of the disease with good clinical efficacy from the perspective of drug properties qbd belongs to cold medicine if the patients normal constitution is partial to yang deficiency it is not suitable to take more and use for a long time to avoid damaging the organismcurrently the number of convalescent patients of covid-19 is increasing especially in clinical practice by strengthening the integration of traditional chinese and modern medicine the course of disease is shortened and the cure rate is improved modern pharmacology and clinical research also confirmed that the treatment of qbd in covid-19 has the theory of tcm and modern research results as the theoretical basis which is suitable for the treatment of patients with covid-19 it is speculated that its main role is to reduce the level of inflammation in patients simultaneously it plays a role in inhibiting the replication and infection of virus inhibiting the concurrent bacterial infection and improving the immunity of the body however there are few researches on the mechanism of qbds action on human coronavirus through the study on the mechanism of qbds multi-channel anti coronavirus action we hope to provide new ideas for the clinical treatment of covid-19 which improve the cure rate of patients infected with covid-19 reduce their mortality and further explore the pharmacological effect and phase of qbd thus the series researches will provide scientific basis for the study and development of new drugsat the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 first china and then the rest of the world have been confronted with an outbreak of a new airborne transmitted coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 just a few months later there are already millions infected worldwide and with borders closed and strict travel bans imposed local transmission patterns are in place in most countries 1 covid-19 mortality rate appears to be in the range of 34-55 2 which is significantly higher than that for seasonal flu caused by the influenza virus 1 but lower than for both severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 15 3 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 34 4 at the same time the covid-19 transmission rate is much greater than those of mers or sars and poses a real threat to life for a large number of people worldwide especially in older patients with other co-morbidities 5 thus in the absence of effective vaccines and treatments early detection and the ability to define prognostic parameters predicting the course of the disease appear to be of particular interestcoronaviruses represent a large family of zoonotic respiratory viruses 6 that can cause both seasonal cold symptoms and fatal respiratory failure associated with severe inflammation of lower respiratory tract 7 the major clinical symptoms of covid-19 are similar to those experienced during a seasonal flu infection and include fever dry cough headache myalgia and others co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes respiratory diseases hypertension and age may exacerbate the disease manifestations 89 both moderate and severe covid-19 infections cases may result in pneumonia with fluffy opacities on the chest computer tomographic scans lung edema and accumulation of pleural fluid in the lungs 10 11 severe cases require invasive oxygen supplythe exact molecular mechanisms of covid-19-mediated pathogenesis are still under investigation however the lessons learned from sars-cov and mers-cov infections may uncover some key features of covid-19-related pathologies as well as molecular mediators and signaling pathways involved the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2 12 which was released almost simultaneously with the first reported cases 10 revealed that it belongs to the coronavirus genus with 790 nucleotide identity to sarscov and 518 identity to mers-cov inoculation with sars-cov-2 of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects 10 and cessation of the cilium beating of epithelial cells similar to the cytopathic effect observed for sars-cov infection 13 the initial step in viral infection was revealed by the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 spike receptor binding domain 14 which just as sars-cov 15 binds to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the presence of ace2 on the cell membrane is crucial for virus virulence as hela cells lacking ace2 are resistant to sars-cov-2 infection 1617 structural analysis identified residues in the sars-cov-2 spike receptor binding domain that are critical for ace2 binding the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those of sars-cov these similarities in virus entry between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov correlate with detectable cross-neutralizing activity of serum from sars-cov-recovered patients 18 however no available monoclonal antibodies targeting sars-cov receptor binding domain were able to prevent sars-cov-2 infecting the cells highlighting unique intrinsic structure features of sars-cov-2 s-protein binding domain including a much higher binding affinity than that of sars-cov s-protein 19 in line with this more recent study reports that human recombinant soluble ace2 effectively but not completely prevents sars-cov-2 infection suggesting alternative mechanisms for viral entry 20surface molecule cd147 emmprin or basigin is being considered as one alternative pathway for the virus to enter the host cells since sars-cov-2 s-protein can bind cd147 as suggested by preliminary data 21 cd147 is expressed on hematopoietic cells including red blood cells epithelial and neuronal cells 22 basigin is viewed as the molecular gate for plasmodium pmalariae 23 not surprisingly cd147 is also associated with the hiv1 24 and sars-cov 25 infections in both cases viral protein binds to the cd147 in complex with cyclophilin a cypa sars-cov n-protein conjugates with cypa inside ace2-expressing infected host cells 25 with this modification newly assembled viral particles can infect cd147-positive cells however further studies are needed to evaluate possible impact of sars-cov-2 interaction with basigin in the context of covid-19ace2 crucial for sars-cov-2 virulence is expressed in the upper and the lower respiratory tract most remarkably on lung alveolar epithelial cells arterial and venous endothelial cells as well as enterocytes of the small intestine epithelial cells in the kidney ace2 expression is also detected in heart pancreas testis and brain 26 interestingly ace2 expression is not the highest in the upper respiratory tract 2726 once again supporting the hypothesis that increased transmissibility of sars-cov-2 as compared to sars-cov may be attributed to yet to be identified co-receptors or auxiliary factors adopted by sars-cov-2 28 also the fact that ace2 is widely expressed in other tissues and organs explains a broad spectrum of adverse effects not limited just to the lungs in addition it was shown that sars-cov-2 directly infects ace2-expressing tissue-resident cd169 macrophages in the spleens and lns causing lymph follicle depletion splenic nodule atrophy histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reduction 29 thus virus infection of macrophages firstly enhances viral spread and secondly triggers destructive events in the immune organs such as spleen and lns recent data from the experiments using sars-cov-2 capsid or live virus infection of cultured t cell lines mt-2 and a301 provides first evidence that sars-cov-2 could also infects t cells however expression level of ace2 on t cells is low and thus cd147 is considered to mediate sars-cov-2 entry into t cells 17after virus binds to ace2 fig 1
 serine protease tmprss2 cleaves the viral spike protein then another protease furin subsequently releases spike fusion peptide and the virus enters the host cell through an endosomal pathway 183031 following viral replication assembly and release the infected cells may undergo apoptosis or necrosis triggering the inflammatory response with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of macrophages and th1 cells as well as production of ifn il-17a il-21 and il-22 by neutrophils th17 and cd8 cells in turn sars-cov-2 infection of recruited immune cells may increase their apoptosis and exacerbate lymphocytosis 3233 and finally may lead in some patients to life-threatening conditions such as respiratory distress syndrome cytokine storm and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosiscovid-19 mortality is strongly associated with the development of severe respiratory distress syndrome which requires invasive ventilation it is important to identify those patients who are most likely to develop a severe form of the disease as early as possible based on the existing statistics a number of clinical predictors of the disease deterioration and mortality including the presence of secondary infections lymphopenia 34 comorbidities such as cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases diabetes hypertension obesity and cancer 35 increased cytokine production and serum ferritin 36 have been reported the other study showed that the elevated serum creatinine d-dimers lactate dehydrogenase c-reactive protein procalcitonin as well as increased white blood cell counts may indicate impending respiratory failure and the need for invasive oxygen supply 37 interestingly in recently published reports elevated interleukin-6 il-6 level was proposed as a relevant parameter predicting the unwanted course of the disease and the need for mechanical ventilation 38 39 40 these assumptions are consistent with data from a clinical trial in china that demonstrated on a small number of patients the efficacy of il-6 neutralization during exacerbation of covid-19 associated pneumonia 41 supplementary table 1il-6 is a cytokine with pleotropic functions ranging from hematopoiesis and metabolic regulation to inflammation autoimmunity and acute phase response il-6 modulates host defense through a number of immune stimulating mechanisms control of monocytes and their differentiation into macrophages 42 modulation of antigen-dependent b cell differentiation 43 increased igg production by b cells 44 and promotion of th2 response by inhibiting th1 polarization 45 several studies revealed strong correlation between il-6 levels in the serum and the upcoming respiratory failure 46 47 48 it was shown that even moderately elevated il-6 levels above 80 pgml were sufficient to identify covid-19 infected patients with a high risk of respiratory failure 37 moreover serum sars-cov-2 nucleic acid rnaaemia which is strongly associated with cytokine storm is closely correlated with extremely high il-6 serum levels 47 it was also suggested that serial measurement of circulating il-6 might be important in identifying disease progression or when evaluated immediately after covid-19 diagnosis confirmation may predict the upcoming respiratory failure or alternatively asymptomatic disease among sars-cov-2 infected patients 49therefore it would be valuable to explore the potential contribution of il-6 in the events occurring during sars-cov-2 infection the next section will discuss the mechanisms by which il-6 may possibly affect the disease exacerbation and the potential of therapeutic approaches based on anti-il-6 biologicsil-6 is one of the key proinflammatory cytokines during infection onset especially at the mucosal sites 50 however the impact of il-6 on the disease outcome may vary significantly fig 2
 on one hand il-6-dependent th17 activation and differentiation are important for effective neutrophil migration il-6 together with il-15 modulate cytolytic capacity of cd8 t cells 5152 and finally il-6 as a pyrogenic cytokine contributes to thermostatic regulation which is important for effective anti-viral response 5354 studies using il-6-deficient mice showed that il-6 ameliorates acute lung injury in influenza a virus iav infection 55 il-6-deficient mice infected with influenza virus exhibited higher lethality as well as increased weight loss and fibroblast accumulation in the lungs associated with virus-induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells and neutrophils 56 indicating that il-6 may promote repair following virus-induced lung injury 57 finally early il-6 signaling promotes il-27-dependent maturation of treg cells in the lungs and resolution of viral immunopathology in mouse model of respiratory syncytial and influenza virus infection 58on the other hand il-6 has been implicated in the progression of viral infections in this regard il-6 synergizes with il-1b and tnf to upregulate trypsin expression which activates matrix metalloproteinases and causes the breakdown of basal membrane and extracellular matrix which in turn results in increased tissue permeability and edema 59 th1 cell-derived ifn is essential for effective antiviral immune response however il-6 may inhibit th1 polarization by stimulating cd4 cells to differentiate into th2 cells or by suppressing ifn expression 6061 moreover il-6 promotes th17 cell differentiation and il-17a secretion which in turn activates the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as bcl-xl favoring survival of virus-infected cells in the model of persistent viral infection 62 at the same time il-17 promotes the migration 63 and survival 64 of neutrophils which in turn contribute to the pathogenesis of covid-19-driven ards 65 finally in contrast to influenza virus infection il-6-deficient mice infected with murine pneumonia virus are characterized by better survival than wt mice with decreased lung edema and diminished neutrophil recruitment 66taking into account that in several experimental models of viral lung infections il-6 demonstrates either pathogenic 66 or protective 55 effects in vivo the role of this cytokine in sars-cov-2 infection should be carefully evaluated moreover the consequences of il-6 induction in covid-19 may vary depending on the infection stage and on the host immune statuspatients with the most severe outcome of sars-cov-2 displayed high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines responsible for cytokine storm induction 3667 interestingly the majority of severe covid-19 cases with respiratory distress syndrome were associated with high systemic il-1b tnf and il-6 levels suggesting a direct connection between proinflammatory cytokine induction and adverse effects of covid-19 34 as sars-cov-2 shows 79 nucleotide identity to sars-cov major pathogenic mechanisms including cytokine storm and extensive lung damage during sars and covid-19 infection may be similar cytokine storm is a condition caused by extensive activation of the immune system and as a result extremely high production of cytokines and chemokines since cytokine storm can lead to multiple organ failure it is important to understand the mechanisms driving this conditionin lower respiratory tract sars-cov-2 infects predominantly type 2 alveolar epitheliocytes the cell type which does not participate in active gas exchange following replication and disengagement of the lung epithelial layer virus enters the underlying tissues and infects or is being captured by macrophages dendritic cells and neutrophils resulting in further viral spread 29 fig 3
 at the same time damaged epitheliocytes release danger molecules which drive the activation of lung epithelium and resident immune cells thus even at the early onset of viral infection its penetration of the mucosa to the epithelial layer activates the innate immune response adaptive immunity is also activated during covid-19 mainly by antigen presenting dendritic cells which produce large amounts of cytokines including il-6 il-1b and tnf and migrate to the regional lymph nodes to present viral antigen to nave t cells pushing their differentiation and migration into the affected tissue 68 specific humoral response represented by viral-specific antibody-producing b cells is also in place 69 replication of the virus results in further damage of affected organs together with self-boosting immune response manifesting to uncontrolled overexpression of inflammatory mediators in severe cases another mechanism driving cytokine storm during viral infections is increased blood vessel permeability which enables infiltration of effector cells producing additional amounts of inflammatory molecules and exacerbating hyper cytokine production 70 in addition leakiness of blood vessels allows virus to spread to other tissues and organs compromising their functions finally under persistence of inflammatory factors an increased number of inflammatory exudates and erythrocytes enter the alveoli resulting in lung damage and respiratory failure syndromeas mentioned above severe covid-19 induced pneumonia is marked by hyperactivation of the immune system and excessive production of il-6 3667 the main source of pathogenic il-6 appears to be myeloid cells as their number is significantly increased among pbmc 69 and in balf of severe covid-19 patients 71 myeloid cell recruitment and activation in the lungs is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in sars-cov mouse model 72 human primary macrophages and dendritic cells can be infected but they fail to support productive replication of sars-cov 7374 unlike alveocytes in which virus can replicate very quickly at the same time sars-cov and apparently sars-cov-2-infected macrophages demonstrate up-regulation of il-6 production and low expression of interferons 2973 interestingly patients requiring intensive care and invasive lung ventilation display negative correlation between il-6 tnf and il-1b concentrations and cd4 and cd8 t cell counts 75 confirming previous studies in animal models which suggested that cytokine storm actually dampens adaptive immunity against sars-cov infection 76 moreover production of ifn by cd4 t cells tended to be lower in severe as compared to moderate cases suggesting that sars-cov-2 infection induces lymphopenia with the suppression of antiviral ifn production 36 furthermore it has been suggested that this pathogenic il-6 is likely to be produced by highly inflammatory macrophages 71 but not by alveolar macrophages which are almost absent in the lung aspirates of severely affected patients 77 at the same time it should be noted that complete ablation of il-6 at the very early stages of viral infection may result in depressed tfh cell maturation and delayed antiviral antibody response 78it is known that acute inflammation and cytokine storm as its extreme manifestation can have a significant effect on hemodynamics and also on platelets and erythrocytes the dysregulated coagulation cascade and the subsequent formation of intra-alveolar or systemic fibrin clots are prominent findings in previous zoonotic coronavirus infections sars and mers orchestrated by crs 79 80 81 covid-19 patients also show significant changes in coagulative status ie low platelet count increased d-dimer fibrinogen levels and dysfunction of micro-vessels in pulmonary circulation 8283 thus thrombosis of the pulmonary capillaries is believed to contribute to rapidly developing hypoxia the role of il-6 in inflammatory hypercoagulation is controversial il-6 can increase the rate of fibrotic clot formation in whole blood but the effect is less pronounced than it is shown for il-1 or il-8 84 on the other hand il-6 is important for thrombus formation being a regulator of mmps and other thrombolysis-associated genes in macrophages 85other characteristic feature of cytokine release syndrome is change in iron homeostasis and hyperferritinemia as indicated by high levels of serum ferritin 86 in covid-19 patients ferritin elevation correlated with poor prognosis 36 as it was an indication of hemolytic events caused by hypercoagulation and hemophagocytosis in general inadequate macrophage activation leads to pathologic phagocytosis of erythrocytes and reutilization of heme iron using ferritin 87 in line with this high systemic ferritin may serve as an indicator of developing macrophage activation syndrome rather than a factor driving covid-19 pathogenesisanother key proinflammatory cytokine tnf is also released abundantly during cytokine storm caused by sars-cov-2 infection serum tnf levels were found to be elevated in severely affected covid-19 patients 34 previously it was shown for sars-cov that its spike protein is able to modulate tnf converting enzyme tace-dependent shedding of the ace2 ectodomain 88 tace expression is coupled to tnf production therefore it is hypothesized that the use of tnf inhibitors may also show some efficacy in preventing viral entry 89 as well as in decreasing immunopathology associated mortality as it was shown in preclinical studies in mice infected with severe respiratory syncytial virus 90 moreover anti-tnf therapy was effective in decreasing the il-6 and il-1b serum levels in lethal bacteremia suggesting that such treatment may provide complex anti-inflammatory effect 91 data obtained from covid-19 infected patients with inflammatory bowel diseases undergoing anti-tnf therapy support safety of such intervention in the context of sars-cov-2 treatment 9293 these findings argue for a potentially protective effect of tnf inhibition in covid-19 and further studies are needed to address this possibilityhypertension has been suggested as a risk factor for severe covid-19 outcomes 94 early data from the literature already assumed an association between blood pressure and circulating il-6 levels in otherwise healthy individuals 95 moreover several studies reported an increased il-6 expression in patients with hypertension 9697 il-6-transgenic mice characterized by elevated plasma il-6 levels displayed pulmonary hypertension 9899 taken together this data suggest that il-6 might be connected with increased risk of respiratory failure in hypertensive patients with covid-19one of the mechanisms regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance is angiotensin-renin system it is comprised of two pathways which are normally functioning in the state of dynamic equilibrium ace2-angiotensin iiangiotensin 1 receptor axis activating vasoconstriction and inflammatory response and ace2-angiotensin 17-mas receptor axis supporting vasodilation and suppression of inflammation fig 4
 a 100 changes in renin-angiotensin system activity are related to the pathogenesis of hypertension and of inflammatory lung diseases in particular acute lung injury caused by viral infections 15101sars-cov2 uses ace2 as an entry site thus reducing ace2 availability promoting an imbalance between the ace2-angiotensin iiangiotensin 1 receptor axis and the ace2- angiotensin 17-mas receptor axis 15102 in line with this recent studies have reported that covid-19 patients have increased angiotensin ii compared to healthy individuals 103 altogether the abovementioned data suggests that covid-19 infection leads to imbalanced angiotensin conversion and a shift towards pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by angiotensin 1 receptor axis 104 fig 4 bangiotensin ii is known to significantly increase the expression of il-6 in a dose-dependent manner 105 through pleiotropic activation of nf-kb transcription factors 106 107 angiotensin 1 receptor downstream activation of nadph oxidase results in elevated oxidative stress in particularly superoxide that activates transcriptional mechanisms that directly promotes il-6 gene expression in turn plasma il-6 concentrations correlate with blood pressure plasma angiotensin ii levels and vascular hypertrophy suggesting an important role of il-6 in the development and maintenance of hypertension specifically that mediated by angiotensin ii 108109 il-6 promotes angiotensin 1 receptor expression sensitizing the vascular wall to angiotensin ii-dependent signaling mechanisms activated cells can release cytokines including il-6 which promote expression of adhesion molecules and induce endothelial activation inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular inflammation 110 this further drives oxidative stress and il-6 expression therefore it is plausible that il-6 and angiotensin ii activate each other through a positive feedback mechanism in support of this hypothesis ace2 protects against lethal avian influenza a h5n1 infection 111 through prevention of oxidative stress and acute respiratory distress syndrome moreover it was recently reported that in covid-19 patients with hypertension angiotensin receptor blockade attenuated the inflammatory response possibly through il-6 inhibition 102112 taking together angiotensin ii accumulation due to sars-cov-2-mediated ace2 downregulation may cause angiotensin 1 receptor downstream activation of nadph oxidase which in turn leads to elevated ros production and to induction of transcriptional mechanisms that directly promote il-6 expression implicated in inflammation-induced injury and immunopathologychronic inflammation is the one common feature of hypertension diabetes obesity and age  the risk factors associated with covid-19 severe outcomes elderly obese and diabetic persons are affected by a low-grade chronic inflammation and are characterized by systemically increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines which may contribute to and facilitate the cytokine storm the main cause of covid-19 mortalityamong conditions predisposing patients infected with sars-cov-2 to severe outcomes diabetes is the most prominent it is estimated that mortality rate of those with covid-19 and diabetes is about 16 8 to 35 113 il-6 is known for its dual role in autoimmune diabetes as it is involved in the development of insulin resistance and -cell dysfunction and at the same time has anti-inflammatory effects and improves glucose metabolism 114 recent clinical data demonstrates significantly elevated systemic il-6 in covid-19 patients with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes 115 covid-19 may exacerbate the pre-existing diabetes since its entry site ace2 is expressed in the pancreas with a potential role in the development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion 116 il-6 may be the link between diabetes and severe covid-19 outcomes through its ability to modulate t cell response some indirect evidence to support this comes from mouse studies of closely related mers-cov infection demonstrating that abnormal elevation of il-17a produced by il-6-dependent th17 cells exacerbates disease severity in diabetic mice 117 consistent with that finding patients with covid-19 have a higher proportion of th17 cells in the blood 118 suggesting that diabetics due to improper activation of th1 and th17 cells may have a compromised anti-viral immune response 31obese patients with covid-19 are more likely to develop severe respiratory distress syndrome 119120 just as diabetics obese patients have higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines both in steady state 121 and apparently during covid-19 infection 8 in addition to decreased anti-viral t cell response enhanced il-6 production by adipose tissue in obese patients 122 may alter innate anti-viral immune response by neutrophils 121 and cause uncontrolled replication of the virus at the early stages of infectionfrom the very beginning of covid-19 pandemic age was identified as a risk factor 38 supporting the idea that ace2 may be a marker of cell senescence 123 myofibroblasts which increase in number with age express high levels of ace2 124 thus myofibroblasts are more susceptible to sars-cov-2 and elderly people bearing higher proportion of myofibroblasts might be more susceptible to covid-19 infection reviewed in 125 il-6 is a critical inflammatory regulator of senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp 126 therefore il-6 overexpression may correlate both with senescent status of cells and tissues as well as with increased expression of ace2 in line with this idea hydroxychloroquine an anti-malaria drug which is now approved in some countries for covid-19 treatment effectively reduced the salivary and serum levels of il-6 in patients with sjorgens syndrome 127 moreover azithromycin prescribed together with hydroxychloroquine can target and selectively remove senescent cells 128 and thus provide anti-fibrotic activity by protecting the lungs from inflammation-induced injury 129130another issue facing elderly patients with covid-19 is a compromised activation status of their effector t cells these cells may display limited function during prolonged infection as a result of their exhaustion associated with the surface expression of such immune-inhibitory factors as pd-1 75 since aging itself is a process known to promote reorganization of the t cell landscape 131 and il-6 is a sasp predictor and regulator t cell exhaustion in the elderly patients with covid-19 is much more evident due to higher basal concentration of il-6 which can enhance the exhaustion process 132133smoking is another potential risk factor for sars-cov-2 infection smokers are more vulnerable to influenza virus infections 134135 and are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 136 enhanced ace2 expression had been reported in the lungs of healthy smokers 137138 in line with that studies in mice have established that cigarette smoke can trigger the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express ace2 in a dose-dependent manner 139 patients with copd as well as active smokers have increased ace2 expression in the lungs 140 which may potentially explain a fourfold increased risk of adverse development and severe outcome of covid-19 141142 taken together these recent reports suggest that smokers may be at higher risk of infection examination of factors predisposing to severe covid-19 in wuhan china revealed that 192 of patients with severe disease were smokers 143 on the other hand preliminary meta-analysis based on chinese patients suggest that active smoking was not associated with the severity of covid-19 144 indicating that impact of smoking on covid-19 progression is controversial and requires further assessmentintuitively patients with pre-existing asthma should display higher proportion of covid-19 severe cases however the prevalence of asthma in covid-19 patients in wuhan study was markedly lower 09 than that reported in the adult population of wuhan 64 143 one possible explanation is a shift toward th2-type immune response in asthmatics as opposed to th1-associated inflammatory response induced by sars-cov-2 infection 118 recent study reveals that tmrss2 expression in upper respiratory tract correlates positively with type 2 response genes especially with il-13 whereas ace2 expression is suppressed by il-13 considering low numbers of cells co-expressing these proteases in the upper respiratory tract it has been proposed that in the context of il-13-dependent reduction in ace2 expression allergy should promote resistance to infection 145 in line with this it was shown that ace2 expression is decreased in nasal and bronchial epithelium of allergic individuals following allergen challenge suggesting that asthma-associated immune response actually protects from covid-19-induced pathology 146 nevertheless further studies are required to reveal the impact of covid-19 severity in patients with preexisting asthmameta-analysis studies of covid-19 cases in china from december 2019 to february 2020 report lower incidence of the disease 147 and risk of death 35 in women than in men similar data on association of gender with poorer prognosis for males were obtained earlier for sars-cov 148 149 and mers-cov 150151 in connection to sars-cov-2 the x-linked ace2 gene is of a particular interest significant fraction of genes encoded on the x chromosome undergo dosage compensation however ace2 is located at xp22 ie the area in which genes may escape from x chromosome inactivation 152 possibly contributing to gender disparity in disease susceptibility gender differences in immune responses are known to depend not only on genetic but also on endocrine factors 153154 high doses of estradiol acting through estrogen receptors decrease production of proinflammatory cytokines via suppressing nf-kb signaling pathway 155 in relation to covid-19 the effects of estrogens on il-6 and on disease progression is of particular interest estrogen may suppress lps-mediated il-6 expression in mouse macrophages by both blocking of nf-kb activation 155156 and inhibiting p38 mapk phosphorylation 156 furthermore downregulation of il-6 expression in kupffer cells appears to be er-dependent 157 overall immunomodulatory effects of estrogens may contribute to decreased susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection in women and this question requires further studyone of the common complications from the respiratory viral infections including sars 158 and covid-19 159 is lung fibrosis this is characterized by alveolar epithelial cell injury recruitment and activation of fibroblasts and subsequent production of extracellular matrix ecm in the presence of specifically activated immune cells fibrosis develops as an exaggerated repair process following injury associated with abnormal immune response leading to chronic progressive disease 160 histological examination of lung biopsies from covid-19 patients show massive apoptosis of pneumocytes hyaline membrane formation fibromyxoid exudates 161 which are manifestations that are characteristic for ards and represent key events preceding development of fibrosis reviewed in 162 significant pro-fibrotic m2-like spp1macrophage infiltration was also described for covid-19 correlating with the disease severity 71 damage to the epithelial layer caused by the virus further attracts various immune cells participating in inflammation-repair balance monocytes macrophages granulocytes and t cells in addition some viral components such as n-protein and papain-like protease can directly stimulate production of tgf- one of the pro-fibrotic hallmarks in respiratory epithelium similar to what has previously been reported for sars-cov 163164the role of il-6 had been extensively studied in bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic antibiotic which causes damage of tissues lacking bleomycin hydrolase predominantly in the lungs 165 mice with genetic ablation of il-6 were characterized by impaired fibrosis 166 however in the same model mice with pharmacological rather than genetic inhibition of il-6 demonstrated opposing phenotypes depending on the phase of inflammation-repair cycle specifically il-6 neutralization at the early inflammatory phase day 2 following bleomycin-induced lung injury resulted in apoptosis of pneumocytes which further contributed to pulmonary fibrosis whereas il-6 blockade at the early fibrotic stage day 8 following bleomycin-induced lung injury significantly ameliorated lung fibrosis 167 interestingly treatment of mice with recombinant soluble gp130fc at the late stage of chronic bleomycin model attenuated lung fibrosis emphasizing the importance of sil-6ra and il-6 trans-signaling in mediating this condition 168 it was further suggested that m2-like infiltrating macrophages are the major source of soluble il-6ra in fibrotic foci whereas pulmonary fibroblasts are the recipient cells which proliferate and produce extracellular matrix under trans-il-6 activation finally overexpression of il-6 in respiratory tract mediated by adenoviral vectors also resulted in the exacerbation of fibrosis and was associated with increased levels of m2-macrophages with pro-fibrotic features 169 these pro-fibrotic macrophages are also characterized by increased il-6ra expression 168 ace2 expression is reported for lung heart kidney intestine liver and brain thus similar fibrosis-associated complications should be expected not just for respiratory tract but also for other tissues and organs in correlation with viral load and severity of cytokine release syndrome summarizing the data available at the moment from infection-free experimental models of fibrosis one can conclude that il-6 may affect fibroblast proliferation and functions directly or through potentiation of a distinct macrophage phenotype taking into account the importance of this cytokine at the repair stage anti-il-6 therapy may prove beneficial not only in acute phase but also in subacute proliferative phase of covid-19-related ardssars-cov-2 tropism to neural system is of particular interest while neurological symptoms such as dizziness headache ataxia and anosmia are often found in mild covid-19 patients and develop early in the infection 170 ace2 expression in cns is attributed to the nuclei in brain stem and is associated with cardiorespiratory control 171172 recent study based on scrna sequencing suggests co-expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in olfactory epithelial cells but not in mature olfactory sensory neurons which were initially considered as the most obvious target population for the virus in cns 173 even without the understanding of the exact mechanisms of sars-cov-2 penetration and distribution in cns it should be noted that as a result of the disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and cytokine storm caused by infection blood-brain-barrier permeability is significantly increased which can lead to negative consequences for cns functioning 174175an effective therapeutic approach should include a combination of specific antiviral drugs which inhibit viral dissemination and limit direct virus-induced cytopathic effects coupled with anti-inflammatory therapeutics directed against immunopathology induced by a viral infection 176 sars-cov-2-induced immunopathology exhibits features of systemic hyper-inflammation reminiscent both of cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis 177 since overexpression of il-6 appears to be associated with severe covid-19 outcomes neutralizing antibodies used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases by targeting exacerbated inflammatory immune response of the host may provide a life-saving approach by preventing the cytokine release syndrome in line with that patients responding to cd19 car t cell therapy experience cytokine release syndrome 178 which is well managed by il-6 neutralizing antibodies 179 in a non-randomized open-label clinical trial 21 patients with severe or critical covid-19 were treated with a single dose of tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy 180 90 of patients recovered suggesting that anti-il-6 might be a powerful potential rescue therapy in managing acute respiratory distress syndrome of covid-19 and inhibiting the most adverse outcome peripheral mononuclear cell scrna-seq profiling data obtained from these patients indicate that treatment with tocilizumab does not reduce the number of cytotoxic cd8 and plasma b cells thus does not interfere with robust adaptive immune response 69 preliminary data from 21 patients with covid-19 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and participated in a compassionate-use program at papa giovanni xxiii hospital in bergamo italy indicate that intravenous introduction of siltuximab reduced c-reactive protein level in all patients and significantly improved clinical conditions with a reduced need for ventilation in 33 of patients 43 of patients showed stabilization of their conditions and 24 of patients experienced a worsening of the disease and required intubation 181sarilumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the il-6 pathway through binding and blocking the il-6 receptor recently another clinical trial was initiated which will evaluate the effects of sarilumab in patients with severe covid-19 this us-based multi-center double-blind phase 23 trial will begin at medical centers in new york and is anticipated to enroll up to 400 patients 182the overview of initiated clinical trials of anti-il-6 therapeutics in covid-19 patients is presented in supplementary table 1 in summary strong scientific evidence of the beneficial impact of il-6 inhibitors in the modulation of the covid-19 infection requires further clinical datain the face of a pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide the need to develop new approaches or reassess the existing ones in the treatment of severe viral infections is more pressing than ever despite the fact that humanity experienced viral infections causing deadly pneumonia twice in the past 20 years there are still no drugs specific for coronaviruses the evidence discussed in this review suggests that for patients with risk factors especially those with high systemic levels of il-6 clinically approved neutralizing antibodies against il-6 or its receptor il-6r in combination with standard treatment protocols may provide benefit gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the immune response and mechanistic link of these factors to disease severity is crucial for effective clinical management of covid-19 in severely affected patientsthis work was supported by the ministry of science and higher education of the russian federation grant 075-15-2019-1660the authors declare that there is no conflict of interestthe emerging and re-emerging viruses ebola zika chikungunya h1n1 dengue sars mers have led to numerous global public health crises in recent years and continue to threaten public health and security unfortunately these viruses are often difficult to control due to the lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines in addition to sars-cov2 two other novel coronaviruses have emerged as global health threats since 2002 namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 that was transmitted to 37 countries and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 that was transmitted to 27 countries severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic human coronaviruses hcov are often associated with induced hypercytokinemia also termed cytokine storm in immunocompetent individuals uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines contributes to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ardsthe secretion of multiple cytokines also termed cytokine release syndrome crs is closely related to development of clinical symptoms for example ifn- can cause fever chills headaches dizziness and fatigue tnf- can cause flu-like symptoms similar to ifn- with fever general malaise and fatigue but can also cause vascular leakage cardiomyopathy lung injury and acute-phase protein synthesis 4 il-6 which is an important target in crs induced by adoptive cell therapy can lead to vascular leakage activation of complement and the coagulation cascade leading to the characteristic symptoms of severe crs such as diffuse intravascular coagulation dic 56 it is noteworthy that il-6 is likely to cause cardiomyopathy by promoting myocardial dysfunction which is often observed in patients with crs 7 in addition activation of endothelial cells may also be one of the hallmarks of severe crs endothelial dysfunction can lead to capillary leakage hypotension and coagulopathy 8 fig 1
 taken together these studies argue that the virus-induced immunopathological events play a crucial role in the fatal pneumonia observed after hcov infections 9the development of a cytokine storm is a potentially fatal immune condition characterized by rapid proliferation and hyperactivation of t cells macrophages natural killer cells and the overproduction of more than 150 inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators released by immune or nonimmune cells 1011 in viral infections the aberrant release of pro-inflammatory factors leads to lung epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis which damages the lung microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barrier leading to vascular leakage alveolar edema and hypoxia the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory factors containing il-6 il-8 il-1 and gm-csf and chemokines such as ccl2 ccl-5 ip-10 and ccl3 together with reactive oxygen species cause ards leading to pulmonary fibrosis and death 12in sars-cov infected patients high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn- il-1 il-6 il-12 and tgf and chemokines ccl2 cxcl10 cxcl9 and il-8 were detected in cases of severe disease compared to patients with uncomplicated sars 13 in mers infection high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 and ifn- and chemokines il-8 cxcl- 10 and ccl5 were likewise observed in severe disease compared to mild or moderate disease 14 in contrast to sars and mers doctors in wuhan central south hospital found that the levels of il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf  were significantly elevated in the blood of severely ill patients compared to patients with mild illness 2 the level of il-6 in the blood of the severe group was 76  higher than that of the mild group 30  15 furthermore histological examination and biopsy samples obtained from a patient who died from severe sars-cov-2 infection showed an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory ccr4ccr6 th17 cd4 t cells suggesting that t cell hyperactivation contributesdin part to the severe immune injury in this patient 16 pulmonary examination in other patients with early phase sars-cov-2 pneumonia also revealed patchy inflammatory cell infiltration however the pathological results in early stage of sars-cov2 pneumonia require further confirmation 17 in short aberrant release of multiple cytokines appears to trigger a cytokine storm that produces immunopathogenic damage to tissues and organs even while the immune response seeks to suppress and eradicate the virus fig 1in view of the above observations therapeutic strategies to treat the cytokine storm in the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 pneumonia deserve special attention in accordance with current who guidance 18 supportive therapy remains the most important management strategy for this pneumonia including supplemental oxygen therapy conservative fluid management and empiric antimicrobial application in the time of need it is noteworthy that the use of glucocorticoids remains controversial current who guidance recommends that corticosteroids should not be used in sars-cov2-induced lung injury or shock except in the setting of a clinical trial however in clinical settings front-line physicians in china tend to use corticosteroids prudently at a low to moderate dosage in patients with sars-cov2 infection 19in the period of sars epidemic 20022003 corticosteroids were generally used by clinicians for immunomodulatory treatment and according to clinical feedback could bring early beneficial changes including a decline in fever resolution of radiographic lung infiltrates and the improvement of oxygenation 2021 however further studies indicated opposite clinical outcomes and a systematic review in sars mers and influenza infections indicated no survival benefit and possible harm avascular necrosis psychosis diabetes delayed viral clearance and secondary infections with corticosteroids 22 in our opinion the use of corticosteroids is not recommended for patients with hcov infections although corticosteroids may be used prudently in critically ill patientsone strategy that has received considerable attention in the face of covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma also called passive antibody therapy to treat patients with advanced disease the treatment uses plasma from a patient who has survived covid-19 infection to provide neutralizing antibodies against the virus the antibodies are available and active immediately but only for a limited time as an example of one study five patients critically ill with covid-19 and on mechanical ventilation received convalescent plasma 1022 days after being admitted to a hospital in shenzhen china all patients improved three were discharged after 50 days in hospital while the other two patients were in stable condition well controlled clinical evaluation of this strategy is currently ongoing in light of such positive anecdotal responsesanother potential treatment involves the use of anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab johnson  johnson which was used previously to treat the consequences of cytokine storm following by car-t cell therapy for cancer interleukin-6 il-6 has become a key point in some crs originally described as b-cell differentiation factor-2 bsf-2 and macrophage and granulocyte induction factor-2 mgi-2 il-6 has significant pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic properties and given chronic overproduction in covid-19 patients anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody may be beneficial in controlling cytokine release also il-17 inhibitor secukinumab novartis was used as specific treatment for severe patients with covid-19 pneumonia 25 to control th17 cell activation an additional observation indicated that the expression levels of cd4 t and cd8 t were low while il-6 levels were high in patients with severe pneumonia suggesting that t cell subsets and cytokine levels could be used as one predictor of the transition from mild to severe pneumonia 15pegylated and non-pegylated interferons ifn have been under intensive study for some time however in the case of hcov infection the results of ifn therapy were mixed as predicted by animal and human hcov infection models early application of ifn was slightly beneficial to reduce viral load and improve clinical outcome however delayed ifn administration was of no benefitscompared with the placebo group early application of ifn and ribavirin moderately improved disease severity without affecting mortality 26 the use of sifalimumab monoclonal antibody produced against multiple ifn subtypes medimmune has not been examined clinically but could hold promise in situations of constitutive ifn productionthe early use of ifn had some beneficial effects in sars-cov-infected animal model although the timing of ifn treatment was crucial in determining the course of disease the use of ifn- receptor inhibitors or antagonists could be considered as an approach to avoid excessive inflammatory reactions in late stage severe hcov infection 27 since sars-cov and mers-cov infect mainly airway epithelial cells and ifn- stimulates antiviral gene expression in these cells without over-stimulating the immune system ifn- might be a option in the therapy of hcov infectionoxidized phospholipids oxpl have been demonstrated to promote acute lung injury by increasing the production of cytokineschemokines from lung macrophages via tlr4-trif signaling in influenza a virus iav-infected mice 28 in a recent study therapeutic administration of the tlr4 antagonist eritoran protected mice from lethal iav infection by decreasing the levels of oxpl and inflammatory cytokineschemokines 29 because pathogenic human coronaviruses can cause acute lung injury and promote the production of oxpl in the lungs the strategies of oxpl suppression by using eritoran boc sciences or other similar compounds may have value in controlling hcov induced inflammationsignal transduction by the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 s1p1 in mouse endothelial cells nfected with influenza a virus has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation responses 30 targeted s1p1 antagonism inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells limited pro-inflammatory cytokinechemokine release and reduced mortality and morbidity induced by influenza a virus 31 s1p1 antagonism may be considered a potential therapy in hcov-infected individuals to limit cytokine responsesthe results of studies in animal models have borne out claims that imms paly pathogenic roles in the process of fatal hcov infections in the mice cardiac inflammation model the systemic administration of optimized lipid nanoparticles including ccr2-silenced small interfering rna sirna can effectively degrade ccr2 mrna and destroy the imm recruitment in the inflammatory site thus improving the outcome of the disease 32 because hcovs are single-chain rna viruses and tlr7 agonist r837 a synthetic single-chain rna analog stimulates imms which causes exuberant inflammatory response therefore imm specific tlr-7 signal may promote the excessive inflammatory response caused by hcov infection therefore a tlr7 antagonist targeted approach to alleviate inflammation reaction could be usefulcontinuous renal replacement therapy crrt may benefit severe patients by removing potentially harmful components and maintaining haemodynamic and metabolic status in addition to the conventional aim of maintaining renal function crrt can be used to regulate the immune response of patients with sepsis with the goal to regulate circulating levels of inflammatory cytokine mediators as shown in studies demonstrating removal of inflammatory mediators containing cytokines and complement tnf il-1 il-6 il-8 complement factors c3a c5a and d by crrt 35 at present there is a need for well-designed clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of such a treatment regimenafter covid-19 infection some patients develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs and mods characterized by the uncontrolled release of inflammatory mediators giving rise to a cytokine storm that contributes to increased mortality in ards in summary further experimentations is required to understand the changes in the immune response of patients with covid-19 infection and the mechanisms of abnormal cytokine expression in covid-19 pneumonia accurate prediction and targeted intervention during the course of covid-19 pneumonia will be essential to improve patient survival fig 2there are no financial or other interests with regard to the paper that represent a conflict of interest3334severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a positive-stranded rna virus and has 82 homology with that of human sars-cov genomic analyses indicate 89 nucleotide identity with bat sars-like-covzxc21 and suggests that sars-cov-2 evolved from bats the potential for amplification from the mammalian host intermediate between bats and humans is unknown sars-cov-2 enters human cells mainly by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace21 which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells cardiac myocytes the vascular endothelium and other cells2 sars-cov-2 is transmitted primarily after viral particles are inhaled and enter the respiratory tract3generally people with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 develop signs and symptoms on average of 56 days after infection the disease induces mild symptoms in the initial stage but can cause severe illness including systemic inflammatory response syndrome acute respiratory disease syndrome multiorgan involvement and shock4 according to the most recent data the fatality rate is 60 worldwide a high mortality rate has been observed in certain groups such as older populations and people with underlying health issues such as cardiovascular disease cvd and diabetes mellitus dm5 a few early studies have reported that obesity is associated with the severity of covid-196-8 however the features of covid-19 in people with obesity have not been elucidated and it has not been determined whether obesity is an independent risk factor for susceptibility to infection with sars-cov-2 or the severity of covid-19 or bothwe obtained data from a retrospective multicenter study in which all 28 of the first confirmed patients with covid-19 in the republic of korea were enrolled five of these patients had a body mass index bmi 30 kgm2 189 zheng et al10 investigated 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from three hospitals in wenzhou china and compared patients with obesity and metabolic- associated fatty liver disease mafld with those with nonobese mafld they found that obesity in patients with mafld was associated with a 6-fold increased risk of severe covid-19 illness using retrospective data obtained for 103 patients hospitalized with covid-19 at three hospitals in rhode island usa kalligeros et al8 reported an association between severe obesity bmi 35 kgm2 and intensive care unit icu admission in that study a history of heart disease and obesity bmi 30 kgm2 was independently associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation publications that have investigated the associations between the extent of obesity and other conditions in patients with covid- 19 are summarized in table 1during the covid-19 pandemic dietary patterns have changed to include increased reliance on delivered foods and access to healthy food options has diminished11 delivered foods are mostly fast foods such as pizza hamburgers fried chicken and sugar-sweetened beverages or carbonated soda12 these items are probably more obesogenic than home-cooked foods13 increased consumption of these foods is associated with increased risk of obesity and dm1415people with obesity or who are overweight are reported to be less active1617 in addition during the covid-19 pandemic community health centers gyms swimming pools and parks have been closed by law in many countries as part of their quarantine strategy these changes in the food and social environments may have contributed to an increase in body weight in people with obesity as well as in the general populationa study of 44672 confirmed chinese patients with covid-19 reported an overall case-fatality rate of 23 1023 deaths among 44672 confirmed cases4 in that study the fatality rates were 80 in people aged 7079 years and 148 in those aged 80 years and older in china the fatality rate is higher among those with preexisting comorbid conditions105 for those with cvd 73 for those with dm and 60 for those with hypertension18 an early study of 1099 patients with covid-19 from 552 hospitals in china found that 237 of patients had one or more underlying diseases hypertension in 150 coronary heart disease in 25 and dm in 74 comparison between patients with severe disease n173 mean age 52 years with those with nonsevere disease n926 mean age 45 years showed that patients with coronary heart disease and dm exhibited more severe disease than those without for example the rates of severe versus nonsevere diseases were 58 vs 18 among the patients with coronary heart disease 237 vs 134 among those with hypertension and 162 vs 57 among those with dm19a meta-analysis of six studies that included a total of 1527 patients with covid-19 reported the prevalence rates of hypertension cvd and dm as 171 164 and 97 respectively20 in a retrospective case series study in lombardy italy the most common underlying medical conditions among patients admitted to the icu with covid-19 were hypertension 49 cvd 21 and dm 1721 according to the data from the italian national institute of health the fatality rate of covid-19 was 355 in patients with dm22 early data from the us centers for disease control and prevention on march 28 2020 reported that dm was the most prevalent health condition 109 prevalence in people infected with sars-cov-2 the prevalence of dm was 32 among patients admitted at icu23 in contrast an epidemiological data reported that patients with dm are not at higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection than the general population22glucose and glutamine are good sources of energy for viruses35 a high glucose condition affects immune function and conversely dysregulated immune status is linked to macrovascular complications 3637 a high blood glucose level in people with dm may provide a favorable environment for viruses to proliferate in addition infection with sars cov-1 has been reported to cause hyperglycemia in people without preexisting dm38 it is possible that dm particularly when not well controlled may increase the risk of complications arising from covid-19 and the risk of death2139obesity represents a state of chronic low-grade inflammation hyperplastic or hypertrophied adipose tissues directly secret various inflammatory products fig 1 such as inflammatory cytokines transforming growth factor- adipokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 5 hemostatic proteins proteins affecting blood pressure and angiogenic molecules58 59 the main inflammatory cytokines derived from adipose tissues are tumor necrosis factor  tnf- il-6 and il-1 increased tnf- level in people with obesity reflects a potential role of this cytokine in obesity-associated inflammation particularly insulin resistance il-1 can activate transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-b nf-b which increase inflammatory signaling and overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor increased il-6 level in obesity plays an important role in inflammation- associated carcinogenesis through the janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway60 in addition il-8 il-10 interferon-gamma ifn- and inducible protein 10 are associated with obesity42 the delayed ifn responses during persistent chronic inflammation and obesogenesis may reflect reciprocal causality between obesity and virus susceptibility43 many cytokines released by dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes in obesity increase the recruitment of macrophages which produce high amounts of proinflammatory moleculesa cumulative effect of chronic inflammation and hypercytokinemia seems to bring about a hyperinflammatory response through macrophage active syndrome especially in patients with severe covid-19 fig 244 inflammation subsequently leads to hypoxia and ischemia which results in an oxidative stress state involving release of inflammatory proteins and reactive oxygen species that impair mitochondrial function as a result protein synthesis by hypertrophic and hypoxic white adipocytes is altered toward the production of cytokines and other inflammatory proteins which may lead to metabolic disease6162 a vicious cycle between elevated release of cytokines and a state of increased metabolic inflammation which leads to cytokine storm occurs in patients infected with sars-cov-2 fig 2 in patients with covid-19 cytokine storm has been proposed to be the cause of the multiorgan failure in patients with severe disease6364 for example hyperglycemia was reported in 51 of patients with sars-cov-2 infection65 hyperglycemia or type 2 dm which is closely associated with obesity has been suggested as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with sars-cov-266several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how sarsfigure cov-2 infection induces inflammation and promotes insulin resistance fig 246 patients with covid-19 exhibit increased production and secretion of inflammatory markers such as c-reactive protein crp d-dimer ferritin and il-667 in general virus infection increases il-6 levels and this increase is associated with increased risk of diabetic complications75 given its proinflammatory role in innate immunity il-6 level may correlate with disease severity and a procoagulant profile76 by increasing oxidative stress il-6 can damage proteins lipids and dna and this damage may alter the organisms structure and function viral-induced production of ifn- by natural killer cells causes insulin resistance in myocytes by downregulating insulin receptor transcription thus causing insulin resistance46the mechanisms linking the poor prognosis of covid-19 with obesity overlap with the pathways that regulate immune function fig 2 obesity leads to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells into adipose tissue under conditions of overnutrition7778 people with obesity have altered innate and adaptive immune responses which are characterized by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation and a higher circulating concentration of proinflammatory leptin and lower concentration of anti-inflammatory adiponectin55 consistent with this unfavorable hormone milieu obesity alone can impair the immune responses to microbial agents such as blunted macrophage activation and proinflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation77 this reduced macrophage activation after exposure to an antigen may explain the poor vaccination success rate observed in people with obesity79 b and t cell responses are also impaired in people with obesity and this can increase the susceptibility to and delay the resolution of viral infection77 diet-induced obesity has been shown to impair memory cd8 t-cell responses to influenza virus infection which resulted in increased mortality and viral titers in the lung and worsened lung pathology80physical inactivity is another important problem among people with obesity fig 2 reduced physical activity by itself40 or mediated by insulin resistance81 has been reported to impair the immune response to microbial agents at several steps including macrophage activation and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines obesity is associated with accelerated immune dysregulation which may relate indirectly to the covid-19 prognosis the effects of obesity on immune function may be important to covid-19 susceptibility and severityproinflammatory cytokines of the t helper 1 signature are known to promote insulin resistance in obesity estan et al46 reported that virus-induced ifn- increases muscle insulin resistance and anti-viral cd8 t-cell responses virus-induced ifn- may directly target skeletal muscle by downregulating its insulin receptors hyperinsulinemia increases antiviral immunity through direct stimulation of cd8 effector t-cell function in prediabetic mice with hepatic insulin resistance caused by diet-induced obesity infection resulted in loss of glycemic control46 therefore upon encountering pathogens the immune system transiently reduces insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle to promote antiviral immunity and induce hyperinsulinemia which result in glucose intolerancetaken together these findings suggest that obesity is associated with accelerated immune system aging andor dysregulation and that these changes may relate indirectly to the covid-19 prognosis the immune modulation induced by obesity may be important to the susceptibility and severity of covid-19 fig 2the reninangiotensin system ras appears to be activated in people with obesity4950 normally when blood flow decreases to the kidneys the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys release renin which activates the ras82 in obesity there is inappropriate activation of the ras in the context of increased sodium intake sodium water retention central blood volume and blood pressure fig 149 this metabolic dysregulation is associated with the expansion in visceral adipose tissue content which leads to increased production of angiotensinogen up to 30 of circulating angiotensinogen and possibly elevated plasma renin activity4950 massiera et al83 showed that angiotensinogen-deficient mice exhibit impaired weight gain which supports the association between obesity and the rasa large amount of visceral adipose tissue induces release of insulin which activates angiotensin type 1 receptors and influences the release of tnf- and il-6 from adipocytes resulting in activation of the ras pathway84 of note the organ involvement of sars correlates with the organ expression of ace2 in addition the localization of ace2 expression in the endocrine pancreas suggests that coronavirus enters islets using ace2 as its receptor and damages islets which leads to hyperglycemia38 these data suggest that the ras may be involved in the association between obesity and covid-19people with obesity might be at a disadvantage after admission to the hospital or icu or when given medications in the icu which might contribute to their increased all-cause mortality older age and comorbidities such as cvd and dm can increase the severity of covid-19 and other factors such as use of steroid can increase the amount of weight gained in people with obesity84wearing proper masks is an important strategy to stop the spread of sars-cov-285 however masks made in only one size may not be effective for people of different body sizes for this reason mask fitting tests for n95 masks are now used in some hospitals in addition people with morbid obesity can have difficulty with mask ventilation86 the facial features of people with obesity may differ from those without8788 and it may be more difficult to find the right mask size for people with obesitysocial distancing is recommended as the most effective way of slowing the spread of covid-19 in a physically identical space larger objects will be placed closer to each other for this reason it may be difficult for people with obesity to maintain social distance from other people which may increase the risk of exposure to the virus people with obesity tend to spend less time in work recreation and rest activities and more time in activities of daily living than do those without obesity fig 141 restricting outdoor and indoor sports activities may have a greater impact on obese populations who are less likely to be physically active the unprecedented boom in delivery industry such as food-delivery services may also contribute to the adoption of an unhealthy diet which may have a stronger effect on people with obesity special attention to lifestyle factors such as a healthy diet may be needed for people with obesity and covid-19glucagon-like peptide-1 glp1 analogues have an anti-inflammatory effect for example the mrna levels of glp1 receptors are downregulated in monocytes that have differentiated into macrophages89 treatment with exendin-4 decreases monocytemacrophage accumulation and mrna expression of inflammatory markers such as tnf- and mcp1 in the arterial wall of apoe mice90 overexpression of glp1 in balloon-injured vessels reduces monocyte infiltration and improves reendothelialization which contribute to reduced neointimal formation91 in mice fed a high-fat diet treatment with liraglutide 30 gkg twice daily decreases tnf- expression and translocation of its downstream signal nf-b p6592 and adhesion of human monocytes to tnf--activated human endothelial cells92
in vitro mcp1 expression and nf-bp65 translocation also decrease significantly after glp1 treatment91 glp1 analogues can shift the polarization profile of macrophages from m1 toward m293 supporting the anti-inflammatory properties of glp1 analoguesliraglutide therapy has an anti-inflammatory effect by increasing nitric oxide production in endothelial cells93 liraglutide and semaglutide treatment reduce the development of atherosclerosis through mechanisms involving inflammatory pathways in apoe and ldl receptor mice94 in humans glp1 and glp1 analogues have been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 95 atherosclerosis91 and neurodegenerative disorders96 taken together these findings suggest that glp1 analogues have a protective role against atherosclerosis that is mediated by a dampening of the inflammatory pathways97 therefore alleviation of inflammatory processes in the vascular system by these agents is a rationale for the recommendation to prescribe glp1 analogues during the covid- 19 pandemicdipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 inhibitors are one of the most frequently prescribed medications for patients with dm regardless of bmi dpp4 inhibitors have both positive and negative effects on the immune system for example the use of dpp4 inhibitors was reported to increase the rate of certain types of infection98 but basic and clinical studies support its anti-inflammatory properties99dpp4 are oligopeptides and play an important role in various biological processes such as proliferation t-cell immunity and glucose homeostasis100 the interaction between coronaviruses and this cellular type-ii transmembrane protein dpp4 cd26 has generated great interest recently dpp4 serves as the receptor for middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in the same way as ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov and sarscov- 2101 experimental studies have suggested that certain polymorphisms of dpp4 are associated with a reduced rate of merscov infection102 this finding may explain the perplexing absence of mers-cov cases in africa despite the presence of the virus in camels presumably because of the frequent presence of protective polymorphisms of dpp4 in africans102 in one in vitro study sitagliptin vildagliptin and saxagliptin could not block the entry of coronaviruses into cells103 although ace2 is the main receptor for sars-cov-2 a recent modeling study did not rule out its interaction with cd26 or dpp4103 at present there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of dpp4 inhibitors in patients with dm and covid-19104the physiological role of ace2 counter-regulates the reninangiotensin aldosterone system raas105 independent of the raas ace2 also regulates intestinal amino acid homeostasis and the gut microbiome106 in coivd-19 ace2 on the respiratory epithelium serve as a main entry of sars-cov-2107 interaction of sars-cov with ace2 is initiated via trimers of the sars spike protein which extends into a hydrophobic pocket of the ace2 catalytic domain that is independent of its peptidase activity108 ace2 is highly expressed in the lung as well as in the heart endothelium kidney and gastrointestinal tract and the tissue distribution of ace2 overlaps with the tissue tropisms of sars-cov-2109 this means that ace2 expression may be implicated in the severe illness caused by covid-19 higher expression of ace2 in patients with hypertension and cvd has been postulated as a factor that increases the susceptibility to sars-cov-2108by contrast there is evidence that ace2 may have a beneficial role in covid-19 both sars-cov infection and challenge with recombinant sars spike protein trigger marked downregulation of ace2 expression in the lung110 downregulation of ace2 results in susceptibility of lung injury111 and unopposed raas activation112 in animal models elimination of ace2 was associated with severe lung injury which could be recovered by recombinant ace2 protein111 in addition ace2-knockout mice exhibited cardiac dysfunction which could be reversed by concomitant deletion of ace113 reduced ace2 expression in cardiac injury has been confirmed in sars infection114 and myocardial infarction111 given that the involvement of the cardiopulmonary system is a key factor for the severity of covid-19 ace2 may play a role in the prognosis of covid-19people with obesity often also develop hypertension or heart failure112 a large multicenter study has confirmed that hypertension can increase the risk of severe covid-19 by as much as 17 times19 raas inhibitors are the mainstay for treatment of hypertension and heart failure because raas inhibitors can increase the tissue expression of ace2 in animal models115 raas inhibitors may increase the susceptibility to covid-19 and its severity after exposure to sars-cov-2108 however all classes of antihypertensive medication including raas inhibitors are not associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness in covid-19116 the effect of raas inhibitors on ace2 level or activity in human studies is controversial generally ace inhibition does not affect ace2-directed angiotensin ii metabolism117118 and only specific raas inhibitors appear to increase the ace2 level119120 by contrast raas inhibitors may potentiate the protective function of ace2 against cardiopulmonary injury121 a recent study of 417 covid-19 patients showed that ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy was associated with a lower rate of severe disease less systemic inflammation and lower peak viral load compared with the use of other antihypertensive drugs122despite uncertainties regarding raas inhibitors on the infectivity of sars-cov-2 there is clear potential for harm related to the withdrawal of raas inhibitors in patients concerned that raas inhibitors may be harmful in those with an unstable status such as heart failure123 or myocardial infaction124 experts strongly recommend that patients should not stop taking their raas inhibitor during the covid-19 pandemic125hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors or statins have anti-inflammatory properties in the justification for the use of statins in prevention an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin trial rosuvastatin reduced the relative risk of major cardiovascular events by 44 in people without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity crp level126 in a viral pneumonia mouse model simvastatin directly modulated antiviral inflammatory responses in lung tissues127 in that study simvastatin treatment attenuated airway inflammation such as rantes regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted expression and neutrophil recruitments 127 rosuvastatin therapy also has additional benefits including anti-inflammatory effects beyond the lipid-lowering property which suggests that this drug has pleiotropic effects128 these data support the favorable effects of statins on respiratory diseases 129 statin therapy should be continued during the covid-19 pandemic if there is no definite contraindicationduring the covid-19 pandemic people with obesity should maintain a heathy lifestyle regular exercise is essential to maintaining immunity130 healthy eating is also crucial for strengthening the immune system and reducing inflammation130 people with obesity who experience symptoms such as cough sputum fever or a sudden increase in blood glucose level should consult their physician immediately the clinical guidelines for the management of obesity- related disorders should be followed closely health-care providers should make sure that their patients with obesity do not stop taking antiobesity agents particularly glp1 analogues or medications for obesity-related disorders such as statin and ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers provided there is no contraindication to these patients taking these agentsin conclusion covid-19 is a global pandemic and may pose considerable health hazard especially for people with obesity obesity is a risk factor for poor outcomes of viral infection because of the deleterious effects of obesity on the immune system which can lead to mortality in people with obesity with covid-19 during the covid-19 pandemic it is important for people with obesity to maintain a healthy lifestyle and their medications should be adjusted properly close monitoring of patients with obesity is required because of the restrictions imposed by the quarantine policies on physical activity and healthy eating the optimal management strategy for these people warrants further investigationthe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the complications caused by coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 are a global public health challenge the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 infection closely resembles cases from the 20022003 epidemic of sars-cov with aggressive inflammatory responses resulting in damage to the lungs 1 disease severity is not only due to viral infection but it is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the host immune response indeed sars-cov-2 infection and the destruction of lung cells trigger a local immune response innate immune cells including local macrophages and monocytes recruited from blood respond to the infection releasing cytokines priming an adaptive immune response from t cells and b cells 1 in most cases this immune response is capable of resolving the infection however in some cases an exaggerated production of cytokines also known as a cytokine storm can lead to sepsis which is responsible for 28 of the total fatal cases of covid-19 in such cases exacerbated inflammation leads to multi-organ damage affecting mostly pulmonary cardiac hepatic vascular and renal systems 1in the absence of evidence-based treatments or vaccines to counter sars-cov-2 social distancing has been adopted worldwide to control virus transmission however isolation measures are not without adverse effects periods of confinement can lead to physical dysfunction and mental distress partially attributed to reductions in habitual physical activity 2 physical inactivity accumulated over weeks and months can lead to immune system dysfunction which could in principle increase infection susceptibility and exacerbate the pathophysiology of conditions that are common among older adults including cardiovascular disease cancer and inflammatory disorders 3 older adults and people living with these comorbidities are at a greater risk for complications during covid-19 disease given that ageing is also associated with a decline in physical activity and alterations in immune function 4 5 it is plausible that there is an interaction between these age-associated changes and covid-19 disease pathogenesis in this brief review we discuss the negative impact of physical inactivity on immune function and showcase evidence that regular physical activity may be an effective strategy to counter some of the deleterious effects of social isolation furthermore we highlight key research questions in exercise immunology with a focus on older adults in the context of covid-19the majority of research conducted over the past century has investigated how being physically active affects the immune system 6 fig 1b however evidence is beginning to accumulate that physical inactivity and its consequences such as adipose tissue accumulation and muscle dysfunction deleteriously affect both innate and adaptive immunity for example physical inactivity accumulated over weeks months and years is associated with increased systemic inflammation eg increased tnf- ifn- and crp impaired natural killer cell cytolytic activity 7 and reduced t-cell proliferation and cytokine production 8 9 all of which can result in a loss of viral control 10 11 it is important to emphasize that some understanding of how physical inactivity affects immune function comes from experiments conducted in space so the effects of microgravity radiation exposure and psychological stress need to be considered however other studies have been conducted using space-flight analogs on earth consisting of head-down tilt bed rest in humans or in animal models using hind-limb unloading 9 10 12 for example in rodents hind-limb unloading resulted in decreased responses of bone marrow cells to colony-stimulating factors resulting in an alteration of leukocyte differentiation and activation following antigenic stimulation 13 other studies have shown that hind-limb unloading results in failure to generate long-term memory responses among t cells leading to a loss of resistance to bacterial pathogens 14 human bed rest studies have also reported increases in systemic inflammation alterations in leukocyte subset distribution impaired t-cell ifn- production and impaired natural killer cell functions 13 these immune system disturbances are thought to contribute to the development of urinary tract infections and reactivation of latent herpesviruses in astronauts during missions 13 or mild reactivation of epstein-barr virus and varicella zoster virus 15 during prolonged periods of physical inactivity further research that could be interpreted as supporting the concept that physical inactivity leads to impaired immune function comes from other settings such as studies recruiting overweight or obese participants who are often physically inactive too for example people who are obese exhibit poor antibody responses to vaccination 16 17 18 and impaired lymphocyte proliferation following mitogenic stimulation 19 these immunological effects likely lead to a greater risk of viral and bacterial infections and longer stays in hospital due to more frequent and prolonged complications following surgery 20 21research over the past century has determined that being regularly physically active and undertaking bouts of exercise has a profound effect on the immune system 6 although since the 1980s there has been a debate over whether very large volumes or high intensities of exercise can suppress the immune system 22 23 it is now generally agreed upon that most forms of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise is beneficial for immune function 24 indeed it is now accepted that bouts of exercise enhance immune surveillance this is because exercise causes substantial hemodynamic changes eg increases in cardiac output vasodilation and blood flow which impose mechanical forces on the endothelium 11 this causes leukocytes to demarginate and enter the free-flowing circulation concomitantly with the release of catecholamines and glucocorticoids following the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 11 this orchestrated response induces a striking 2- to 4-fold increase in total leukocytes leukocytosis and a redistribution of so-called effector cells between the blood compartment and the lymphoid and peripheral tissues 11 indeed exercise preferentially mobilizes leukocyte subtypes with tissue-migrating characteristics and the capacity for rapid effector function such as natural killer cells cd8 t cells and neutrophils 11 the rapid redistribution of immune cells with every exercise bout most likely enhances immune surveillance reducing the chance of pathogens gaining a foothold and causing overt disease in regular exercisers many of the immunoenhancing effects of exercise are direct including priming of the cells mobilized by exercise improving their tissue migration capacity cytotoxic function and the ability to recognize antigens 11 other effects of exercise include immune cell metabolic reprogramming anti-inflammatory signaling 11 and effects on the lymphatic system 25 for example although lymph is thought to primarily circulate due to intrinsic lymphatic pumping extrinsic compression caused by skeletal muscle contraction respiratory activity and bodily movement also contribute 25 thus being physically active may facilitate the circulation of lymph within the lymphatic vessels further enhancing the ability of the immune system to respond to antigens 25although the immune system responds to single bouts of exercise in a transitory way it is likely that these effects accumulate over time and produce the immunological adaptations that happen with long-term exercise training 11 fig 1b for example regular exercise has been shown to reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and has been linked to increased t-cell proliferation and cytokine production following antigenic stimulation increased neutrophil phagocytic activity and increased natural killer cell cytolytic activity 11 these changes indicate that regular moderate-intensity exercise might be capable of improving or at least maintaining immunity across the life span 26 indeed exercise training is capable of improving immune responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines hastening the recovery following experimental rhinovirus infection 11 and reducing the incidence and the number and severity of symptoms associated with acute respiratory infections eg upper respiratory tract infection 24 long-term regular exercise training can also reduce the expression of toll-like-receptors especially tlr-4 on the surface of monocytes promoting switching of the proinflammatory m1-like macrophages to the anti-inflammatory m2-like a response that mitigates the monocyte-downstream inflammatory signaling cascades resulting in anti-inflammatory actions 27 other longer-term but indirect effects of exercise on the immune system are largely attributable to changes in body composition and metabolism 11 reducing fat mass reduces inflammatory macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue chronic low-grade inflammation and inflammatory signaling cascades 28 reducing cholesterol content of cell membranes that accompanies changes in body composition may improve t-cell receptor signaling for antigen presentation while improvements in cardiovascular and endothelial function with exercise may facilitate immune cell recirculation between the blood the lymphoid and peripheral tissues 11 finally evidence that regular physical activity over a lifetime might prevent delay or limit the age-associated deterioration of immune competency  referred to as immunosenescence  is now beginning to accumulate 5 26it is unknown how bouts of physical activity and exercise might influence the immune response to sars-cov-2 infection which could be a moot point given that individuals self-isolate and typically rest when an infection is suspected however there remains a possibility that individuals may undertake physical activity or exercise when unknowingly infected especially if initially asymptomatic following sars-cov-2 infection active replication and release of virus causes the host cells to undergo pyroptosis and release danger signals recognized by neighboring epithelial cells endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages which produce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines additional tissue-resident macrophages are recruited and monocytes and t cells extravasate from blood and other tissues contributing to the inflammatory response thus it is conceivable that this immune surveillance response might be enhanced by bouts of physical activity or exercise facilitating the detection and elimination of sars-cov-2 infected cells and potentially limiting disease severity for example animal experiments using labelled cells have shown that the lungs are a site of immune cell extravasation following exercise 29 however if sars-cov-2 infection is suspected resting would be the most cautious approach given that it is the excessive accumulation of immune cells in the lungs and an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines which leads to complications in the most severe cases of covid-19 1immunosenescence is the decline in immune function that takes place with biological aging fig 1a which is influenced by environmental factors such as viral infection in particular cytomegalovirus but probably also lifestyle 5 26 30 immunosenescence is characterized by particularly marked changes in the adaptive immune system especially among t cells and b cells 31 within the t-cell compartment there is a diminished thymic output of naive t cells from adolescence and continued differentiation into memory t cells with infections 31 some studies show that overall t cells exhibit a reduced proliferative capacity and cytokine production in response to stimulation by mitogens 30 other cells are also affected including a decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to toll-like receptor agonists in myeloid dendritic cells 31 within the b-cell compartment naive b cells decline memory b cells accumulate and there is a diminished diversity of the b-cell repertoire 31 these effects on the cellular composition and function of the immune system lead to a greater incidence and severity of viral and bacterial infections among older adults 32 33 and less effective vaccine responses 34 when compared to younger individuals importantly immunosenescence has been linked to a higher risk of chronic diseases frailty and all-cause mortality 35 importantly individuals exhibiting signs of immunosenescence may have poor control over the initial inflammatory response to infection and may have a poor ability to generate an efficient and robust adaptive immune response by effector t cells and b cells 31 35 this may partially explain the suboptimal responses to infection and vaccination exhibited by older adults compared to younger counterparts 34 thus it could be argued that immunosenescence predisposes older adults to a greater risk of complications caused by covid-19 36encouragingly evidence is beginning to accumulate showing that people who have been regularly active for the majority of their lifetime exhibit less pronounced features of immunosenescence for example one study compared 125 adults 5579 years who had maintained a high level of physical activity for much of their adult lives to less-active 75 age-matched controls 4 the frequency of b cells naive t cells and recent thymic emigrants were higher in active compared to inactive older adults some of these effects were thought to be driven by higher serum levels of the thymoprotective cytokine il-7 and lower il-6 among active older adults 4 in addition there is evidence that regular exercise training can improve influenza vaccine responses among older individuals 11 for example antibody titers to the h1n1 and h3n2 strains of the influenza a virus were enhanced in older adults immunized with a trivalent influenza vaccine after a 10-month aerobic exercise training intervention 11 likewise community-dwelling older adults engaged in a 10-month cardiovascular exercise training program had increased seroprotection rates compared to nonexercising age-matched controls up to 24 weeks after receiving an influenza vaccine 11 studies showing improvements in vaccine responses following exercise training are considered to be robust evidence showcasing how the immune system can be positively affected by exercise 37 although it might be expected for very active people to exhibit slower immunological ageing compared to inactive people interaction between physical activity or exercise with individual components or drivers of immunosenescence  such as cytomegalovirus  are more nuanced 38 for example individuals latently infected with cytomegalovirus exhibit exaggerated exercise-induced t-cell immune surveillance which might improve the detection of infections and damaged cells but could also amplify inflammatory responses 38 not all immune responses to exercise are affected in the same way by cytomegalovirus however exercise-induced immune surveillance by natural killer cells is impaired whereas exercise-induced b-cell responses remain unaffected among people latently infected with cytomegalovirus 38further justification for promoting a physically active lifestyle among older adults is that habitual physical activity declines with aging due to an increase in time spent undertaking sedentary behaviors and decreasing time spent undertaking moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 39 leading to muscle wasting and weakness 40 skeletal muscle is a major immunoregulatory organ and produces a range of soluble factors which have anti-inflammatory and immunoprotective effects 41 indeed regular exercise improves physical capacity and muscle mass and function and reduces cardiometabolic risk factors and systemic inflammation in older adults 42 physically active older adults have lower concentrations of circulating proinflammatory biomarkers and higher concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to physically inactive individuals and this is partly due to muscle physiology 42 indeed muscle contraction triggers an anti-inflammatory response by releasing so-called myokines  muscle-secreted factors that influence almost all aspects of physiology and metabolism 43 during exercise predominantly il-6 is released into the blood from contracting skeletal muscle independently of tnf- or nf-b activation eg as opposed to sepsis and induces a subsequent increase in the production of il-1ra and il-10 by various immune cells in addition to the acute effects brought about by stimulating the myokinome regular physical activity also modulates the properties of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue reducing systemic inflammation 28 thus partly due to these mechanisms physical activity is associated with a reduced incidence of chronic age-related conditions such as cardiovascular metabolic and pulmonary diseases and cancer 44 in addition these anti-inflammatory mechanisms provide a nonpharmacological therapeutic intervention that can influence the disease pathogenesis and disease trajectory in a number of clinical conditions 45 46 taken together these data emphasize the importance of maintaining optimal levels of physical activity in older adults in order to ameliorate or perhaps prevent age-related disturbances in the immune system and minimize complications caused by chronic diseasegiven the very recent emergence of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 future studies should investigate whether being physically active is a protective factor for reducing the risk of complications caused by covid-19 this hypothesis is supported by a recent cohort study that calculated the population attributable fraction to show that physical inactivity accounted for up to 86 of hospitalized cases of covid-19 and obesity  a condition potentially preventable by physical activity  contributed to 295 of the cases 47 interventional studies are necessary to confirm these findings in addition it should be examined whether people who are regularly physically active exhibit faster recovery times and are less likely to have poor outcomes considering that single bouts of aerobic and resistance exercise have been shown to improve vaccine responses 26 if older adults exhibiting signs of immunosenescence generate poor antibody responses to vaccines developed for sars-cov-2 36 then exercise could be prescribed at the time of vaccine administration to boost antibody responses as a form of behavioral adjuvant ie the so-called immune-enhancement hypothesis 48 which remains to be tested in the context of covid-19social isolation is likely to lead to a decline in physical activity which could result in immune dysregulation but more broadly also impairments in glucose and lipid metabolism physical dysfunction and mental distress 49 in this scenario the maintenance of physical activity levels become of paramount relevance for improving immune function for the general population fig 2 physical activity is particularly important for older adults and those with chronic disease not only because these individuals may exhibit impaired immune function 26 but also because these people will gain almost immediate benefits related to cardiometabolic health muscle function and overall wellbeing 12 49 of clinical relevance social isolation has been associated with heart disease depression anxiety and mental distress 50 some studies have shown that stress depression symptoms and social isolation can impair immune defenses which can make an individual more susceptible to a potential viral infection 13 27 in this context promoting a physically active lifestyle could help individuals to cope with the psychological distress and the dramatic lifestyle changes during social isolation although it is worth emphasizing that there is no direct evidence that physical activity can prevent or treat covid-19 promoting an active lifestyle is a key intervention to counteract the effects of social isolation thus healthcare professionals and public health policy makers should promote physical activity to everyone but especially older adults and other at-risk individuals such as those living with chronic diseases associated with aging and lifestylethe authors declare no conflict of interestsad ajp and

revision from jet all of the authors have seen and approved the final version of this papers for publicationalthough the pathogenesis of this disease has not been fully understood it seems that the host immune responses play an important role aberrant host immune response causes lung tissue damage reduced lung capacity and finally respiratory failure 4 studies indicated that dendritic cells dcs and macrophages are playing crucial role in innate immune responses 12 13 these cells produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including tnf- il-12 il-6 ifn and il-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor g-csf 6 14 these inflammatory responses may lead to systemic inflammation 6 7 13 14adoptive immunity plays a major role in viral infections 15 cytotoxic t cells cd8 t cells are the main t cell subsets that destroy infected cells 16 therefore the number of these cells is one of the major factors for clearance of the viral infection 17 18 preliminarily it was indicated that the number of total t cells cd4 and cd8 t cells reduced significantly in covid-19 patients this decrease was more intensive in icu admitted patients compared with that in non-icu admitted individuals 19 it is also reported that t cell clonal exhaustion occurred during the infection and the expression of certain t cell surface markers like pd1 programmed cell death protein 1 and tim-3 t cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 markedly increased 19 20 the cytokine storm occurred in response to sars-cov-2 infection that led to increased expression of nkg2a natural-killer group 2 member a on cytotoxic t cells ctls and nk cells this upregulation suppressed ctl and nk function and cytokine secretion 19 21 22 it is suggested that inflammatory cytokines tnf- and il-6 mainly originated from apoptotic monocytes cd14cd16 and macrophages and induced t cd4 and t cd8 cells 19 23 these excessive inflammatory responses might result in respiratory system pathology and dysfunction 23perhaps it takes many years to achieve a specific and effective therapeutic protocol efficient vaccine or suitable medicine for the treatment of covid-19 there is a wide range of existing and current treatment strategies categorized into antiviral drugs immunotherapy protocols including convalescent serum and monoclonal antibodies cell-based therapies hydroxychloroquine chinese medicine and steroids just for patients who suffer from ards 24 a schematic figure fig 1 summarized the novel therapeutic approaches in treatment of covid-19 patients moreover there are a growing number of clinical trials registered for the treatment of covid-19 table 1antibody injection to the patients and susceptible people provides rapid immunity to treat or prevent the disease 2527 past experiences from sars and mers viral infections indicated that passive immunotherapy could be a potential treatment strategy for the patients 2729 it is considered that passive immunotherapy could also be beneficial in sars-cov-2 infection 30 extracting neutralizing antibodies from recovered individuals with high titer of antibodies in sera and transfusion to infected patient could deactivate the virus however neutralization activity of these antibodies is not fully understood it has been showed that neutralizing antibodies are not long lasting and only the recently recovered patients are suitable candidates 31 it has also been reported that the neutralizing antibody titers vary among the patients and elderly patients had higher antibody titer compared with young recovered individuals 32 it is supposed that convalescent serum administration may induce phagocytosis and antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity 25 27 one important implications for using convalescent serum is the risk for antibody-dependent enhancement ade 33 it is supposed that these neutralizing antibodies may enhance other viral infections 34 another major limitation of this strategy is donor shortage however by increasing the number of recovered individuals this limitation would be solved 25it has been shown that monoclonal antibodies mabs could be an effective tool for the treatment of viral infectious diseases 3537 different techniques have been used to develop mabs including phage display library hybridoma single b cell isolation and transgenic mice 37 various monoclonal antibodies developed against mers and sars infections include m396 80r and s31 against sars and lca60 for the treatment of mers disease 29 3741 these mabs limited virus replication and facilitated lung recovery in animal models 4244 s protein is also the most immunogenic determinant of coronaviruses 40 several mabs target receptor-binding domain rbd in the virus spike s glycoprotein and inhibit the virus to invade the host cell 9 it is reported that mabs against sars-cov-1 could cross react with sars-cov-2 45 it is indicated in the preprint that mab 1a9 that targets the s protein of sars-cov-1 could interact with sars-cov-2 46tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against il-6 receptor cytokine tocilizumab targets both membrane and soluble-bound il-6 receptors this mab is used for the treatment of covid-19 patients 47 it is shown that the il-6 level is considerably high in severe covid-19 cases treatment of 21 severe covid-19 cases with tocilizumab indicated that using this monoclonal antibody is an effective treatment and well tolerated in these patients in the preprinted study tocilizumab caused body temperature and crp returned to the normal levels and improved lung function 48 there are also many registered clinical trials on efficiency and safety of tocilizumab for the treatment of covid-19 table 1vegf is one of the main mediators of vascular permeability and progression of ards bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vegf and employed in a phase iiiii clinical trial for the treatment of covid-19 patients nct04275414as described earlier during the sars-cov-2 infection exhaustion of t and nk cells happens in order to restore these cells using monoclonal antibodies to block the pd-1pd-l1 and tim3 pathways may have beneficial therapeutic effects as well 49it is suggested that an inhibitor of janus kinase jak called baricitinib could prevent the entry of sars-cov-2 into the host cells and also inhibit the inflammation 50 51 cyclin g-associated kinase gak and ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 are endocytosis regulators baricitinib might inhibit sars cov-2 entry by disruption of these regulators other jak inhibitors such as fedratinib and ruxolitinib are also candidates for decreasing inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 individuals 51 although jak inhibitors have wide effects and can inhibit cytokine secretion such as ifn- more studies need to confirm their safety and efficiency 14adoptive transfer of antigen-specific t cells has been developed for the treatment of cancers autoimmunity and viral infections including hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis c virus hcv and cytomegalovirus cmv 2426 in this approach anti-viral-specific t cell clones are generated expanded and purified in vitro 26 it is shown that engineered sars-specific cd8 t cells had normal activity and function and may be a potential therapeutic tool for sars infection 27 recently it has been indicated that the number of cd8 t cells decreased dramatically and the ratio of cd4cd8 t cells increased during the sars-cov-2 infection this decrease in the number of cd8 lymphocytes has been correlated with the disease severity and clinical outcome 52 it has also indicated that cd8 t cells and the cd4cd8 ratio decreased and increased respectively after the treatment it seems that cd8 t cells play an important role in covid-19 and could be a potential biomarker of the disease 52 53 due to these findings adoptive transfer of covid-19-specific cd8 t cells may be an effective treatment strategy 28 nk cells are innate immune cells that play a crucial role in host immune response after viral infections 54 preprinted studies indicated that nk cell population decreased remarkably during the disease 55 56 it has been indicated that during sars-cov-2 infection increased amount of il-6 inflammatory cytokine had negative correlation with the number of nk cells 52 thus it is assumed that adoptive transfer of nk cells may have an effective therapeutic approach therefore recently an ongoing phase i clinical trial has been registered in which nk cell therapy in combination with conventional therapies for covid-19 patients was proposed nct04280224 altogether it seems that cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in host immune response against sars-cov-2 57persistence of inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 patients leads to lung dysfunction and even death using corticosteroids for dampening cytokine storm suppresses immune system and makes delay in virus elimination 58mesenchymal stromal cells mscs are characterized with their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties 59 60 because of these characteristics they have been used for the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including diabetes graft-versus-host disease gvhd and multiple sclerosis 59 it is proven that mscs and msc extracellular vesicle ev infusion have beneficial effects in the treatment of virus-induced pneumonia by reducing the lung inflammation 61 62 evs are stable could distribute to the lungs and have the same immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of parental mscs 63 mscs decreased inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in animal model of avian influenza they could also prevent immune cell infiltration into the lungs and improved alveolar injury 61 recently there are studies evaluating allogenic mscs and msc-derived exosomes as potential therapeutic tools for reducing inflammation and improving covid-19-related ards 47 64 it is indicated that adoptive transfer of allogenic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells uc-mscs could inhibit inflammation and attenuate symptoms in patients with advanced covid-19 four days after cell therapy patients are disconnected from the ventilator uc-msc therapy also elevated t cell numbers and boosted the immune system 58 administration of ace negative mscs to seven covid-19 patients improved clinical symptoms with no side effects just 2 days after injection the number of inflammatory cytokine secreting cells reduced significantly regulatory dc subpopulation cd14cd11ccd11bmid elevated the levels of il-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine increased while tnf- decreased 65 infusion of mscs also induced lung tissue regeneration by modulating inflammatory microenvironment in covid-19 patients 66 there are several ongoing clinical trials using different sources of mscs for the treatment of covid-19 table 1 taken together msc therapy could inhibit excessive immune system reaction modulate inflammatory milieu and prevent virus-mediated cytokine storm 65 it seems that msc therapy could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of covid-19 64lif leukemia inhibitory factor is one of the important cytokines to protect the respiratory system and promote lung homeostasis during viral infections 67 68 this cytokine modulates severe adverse events during ards 67 up to now there is no study investigating the role of lif in sars-cov-2 infection however in respiratory syncytial virus rsv model it has been shown that overexpression of lif enhanced the recovery of lungs during pneumonia neutralization of the lif induced alveolar damage and chemokine secretion 69 according to these data lif might also have protective effects in sars-cov-2 infectionlif nanoparticles lif-nps indicated clinical benefits in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae animal models lif-nps possessed immunomodulatory effects and increased self-tolerance in animal models for ards 70 these inhalable nps could be a novel strategy for lung tissue repair and cytokine storm inhibition 64 activation and polarization of macrophages play a major role in the initiation and intensity of inflammation respectively in aliards peptide-coated gold nanoparticles could alleviate lung inflammation through inducing m1-to-m2 macrophage phenotype transition and increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in the lung of acute lung injury ali mice 71as mentioned above sars-cov-2 attaches to ace2 receptor to invade the host cells particularly alveolar epithelial cells sars-cov-2 spike protein has strong affinity to ace2 receptor 7274 this attachment may enhance viral entry and replication 74 75 it is assumed that targeting this interaction and using soluble form of ace2 could be a potential therapeutic approach 76 studies on covid-19 indicated that ace2 injection could competitively neutralize the virus and improve lung injury 77 recently a novel therapeutic approach was developed based on soluble ace2 interaction with the virus it has been shown that human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 could inhibit sars-cov-2 from entering the host cells decreasing the viral load in a dose-dependent manner this molecule inhibits viral infection of human blood vessels and kidney organoids these data indicated that hrsace2 was effective in early-stage patients 78 since the inhibitory effects of hrsace2 were not complete it is preliminarily considered that the virus may use a second receptor or co-factor such as transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 79 in this regard tmprss2 inhibitor was approved for clinical application in covid-19 to inhibit the entry of virus 74remdesivir is claimed to be an option to treat covid-19 80 it is a nucleoside analog and has broad-spectrum activities against rna viruses such as mers remdesivir can effectively diminish the viral load in lung tissue infected with mers-cov and improve lung function in animal model 81 the in vitro study revealed that compared with ribavirin or favipiravir remdesivir in combination with emetine showed the inhibition in viral yield that might achieve 649 82 regarding its clinical application grein et al reported the good improvement among severe covid-19 cases 68 n  53 after treatment with remdesivir 83 it also showed promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 in the usa 84 however its efficacy is doubted because eg in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial wang et al reported no statistically significant clinical benefits 85chloroquine is a drug used to treat malaria 86 it is taught that chloroquine has a great potential to treat covid-19 87 chloroquine can prevent ph-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses such as sars-cov 88 additionally chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects by suppressing the productionrelease of tnf- and il-6 it also might interfere with viral infection and replication as an autophagy inhibitor 89 in preprinted paper chen et al showed that hydroxychloroquine use can shorten the time to clinical recovery in covid-19 patients 90 gautret et al claimed that the treatment of covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine chloroquine analog caused the significant viral load reductiondisappearance 91 however other researchers did not reveal the same effect moreover high-dose chloroquine diphosphate in combination with azithromycin or oseltamivir resulted in high rates of death and adverse cardiac events 92 clinicians also cautioned that the increased consumption of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can lead to their shortage that might create a problem for people suffering systemic lupus erythematosus other rheumatological disorders primary sjgren syndrome dermatological diseases and antiphospholipid syndrome 93it has been previously reported that the protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavir used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency virus hiv 94 could improve the outcome of mers-cov- 95 and sars-cov 96infected patients initially lopinavir and ritonavir were hypothesized to inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of sars and mers and seemed to be associated with improved outcomes of patients with sars in a non-randomized open-label trial in a case report from korea it has been shown that the viral loads of a sars-cov-2 significantly decreased after lopinavirritonavir treatment 97 however it is controversial whether hiv protease inhibitors could effectively inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases of sars-cov-2 hiv protease belongs to the aspartic protease family whereas the two coronavirus proteases are from the cysteine protease family moreover hiv protease inhibitors were specifically optimized to fit the c2 symmetry in the catalytic site of the hiv protease dimer however this c2-symmetric pocket is absent in coronavirus proteases if hiv protease inhibitors alter host pathways to indirectly interfere with coronavirus infections their potency remains a concern 98favipiravir is a new type of rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor additionally it is capable of blocking the replication of other rna viruses 99 favipiravir is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form favipiravir-rtp in cells and is recognized as a substrate by viral rna polymerase therefore inhibiting rna polymerase activity 100 favipiravir may have potential antiviral action on sars-cov-2 which is a rna virus in a clinical trial on favipiravir for the treatment of covid-19 the preliminary results indicated that favipiravir had more potent antiviral action than lopinavirritonavir 101bacillus calmette-gurin bcg weakened strain of mycobacterium bovis vaccination could have protective effects against covid-19 infection there are several mechanisms that ensure bcg-induced non-specific protection and are actively studied bcg and viral antigens have similar molecular structure so after vaccination b and t cells can recognize both pathogen types moreover bcg vaccination results in the so-called trained immunityepigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cell types 102 monocytes of vaccinated individuals had higher expression of different surface markers of activation and synthesis of cytokines il-1 il-6 ifn and tnf in response to infection than those of non-vaccinated ones so non-mycobacterium pathogens eg staphylococci yellow fever virus and influenza can be removed faster 103 in several preprints it is claimed that bcg vaccination program could reduce the number of sars-cov-2-infected individuals and their mortality 104 105 however the who does not recommend bcg vaccination to prevent covid-19 because there is still no direct evidence that it can protect against sars-cov-2 infection and all related clinical trials are ongoing 106corticosteroids are well-known with their immunosuppressive activity which are essential to stop or delay the progression of the pneumonia and have been proved to be beneficial for the treatment of ards 107 additionally corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect to diminish systemic inflammation reduce exudative fluid in the lung tissue and inhibit further diffused alveolar damage which can relieve hypoxemia which can protect the lungs effectively and prevent further progression of respiratory insufficiency 108 the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of covid-19 is controversial due to their negative impact on anti-viral immune responses 109 however it has been shown that corticosteroids could improve mortality in severe covid-19 patients with systemic hyperinflammation 110 it is supposed that patient selection half-life formulation and dosage of the corticosteroids are important factors determining the clinical outcome in this regard a preprinted study indicated that in severe covid-19 patients with ards early short-term and low dose of corticosteroid methylprednisolone improved clinical manifestation and long lesions 111although it seems that antiviral drugs are effective in improving clinical manifestation and controlling the sars-cov-2 infection until now there is no definite treatment protocol for this novel virus infection lymphocytopenia alongside with excessive inflammation and cytokine storm followed by ards in these patients are still unsolved problems that cause severity of the disease 14 therefore it is considered that immune response modulation and inflammation management are essential steps based on the abovementioned more studies needed to be conducted on immunopathogenesis and immune response during the sars-cov-2 infection in this regard new therapeutic approaches including mesenchymal stromal cell therapy and immune cell therapy showed promising resultsover the past two decades the world has experienced three acute lower respiratory tract outbreaks caused by coronaviruses those were the epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus cov the epidemic middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and  presently  the pandemic coronavirus infection disease covid-19 or sars-cov-2 initially known as the 2019-novel n-cov mainly prevalent in china and hong kong between 2002 and 2003 sars-cov infection resulted in 8100 cases and more than 770 deaths with a case fatality rate cfr of about 1013 the intermediate host was shown to be the civets4 mers-cov infection on the other hand was predominantly prevalent in the middle east 20122014 and caused over 850 cases resulting in approximately 350 deaths with a cfr of about 385 the intermediate host of mers-cov was identified to be dromedary6 in december 2019 sars-cov-2 infection began to spread from wuhan hubei china and by march 11 who declared covid-19 a pandemic when the number of cases was increased 13 times outside china than the initial number of cases reporting more than 118000 infections and triple the number of countries primarily involved 114 countries with over 4000 deaths7 as of june 16 2020 there were approximately 79 million confirmed cases reported from 210 countries and territories around the world claiming over 450000 lives7 on that date almost one third of the world confirmed cases and death toll were reported in usa alone7 so far the crude cfr is around 65 lower than that of the other two coronavirus pandemics7 although yet to be fully realized the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 is thought to be pangolin8 it is speculated that like sars-cov and mers-cov the natural host is bats9the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc divided the clinical manifestations of the disease severity into mild non- or mild-pneumonia occurred in 81 of the cases severe dyspnea 30min respiratory frequency 93 blood oxygen saturation andor more than 50 lung infiltrates within 12 days in 14 of the cases and critical respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure in 5 of the cases10 in addition to the common systemic symptoms eg fever and fatigue covid-19 manifest in respiratory symptoms that range from mild dry cough difficulty in breathing hypoxemia to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome  ards and acute respiratory or multiple organ failure table 1 covid-19 can also cause severe pneumonia with clinical manifestations biomarker profile and lung imaging similar to that observed in sars-cov13 some severe cases experience acute myocardial injury sepsis andor fungal infection1112 severe clinical symptoms may eventually lead to death
this article explores our current knowledge of the common and different characteristics of the coronavirus epidemic sars-cov and mers-cov and pandemic sars-cov-2 infections emerged over the past two decades special emphasis is directed to understanding the pathogenhost interaction in disease symptomatology and severity the development of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia and the influence of the subsequent inflammation on disease outcome our current understanding of covid-19 together with the knowledge gained from sars-cov and mers-cov infections would permit developing new avenues of approach for disease prevention and treatment and can define effective public health measures to control the spread of covid-19 and other coronavirus-related diseasessars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are all enveloped positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family orthocoronavirinae subfamily  genus that mainly cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans1315 sars-cov-2 genome is in 80 homology with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov but it is 96 homologous with coronavirus isolated from the giant bats in yunnan9 typically the coronavirus genome is 2632 kilobases in length with a highly conservative basic structure sars-cov-2 genome was reported to be 29829 ribonucleotides in length16 in general the coronavirus genome utilizes approximately 67 of the sequence to encode rna polymerase that plays a role in viral protein processing unwinding and replication and blocking host cell protein synthesis91317 the remaining genome however encodes other structural and accessory proteins414 sars-cov-2 has evolved two subtypes a more infectious l-type and the primary s-type18 the different virus subtypes may have a critical role in disease spread and can influence vaccine development and disease therapyin humans coronavirus pathogenesis and infectivity are related to a specific binding between the virus spike s-protein a glycoprotein that exists as a trimer on the surface of the envelope lipid layer and a protease receptor on the human cell surface19 in sars-cov and mers-cov the human cells receptors respectively are angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace22021 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2 or cluster of differentiation 26 cd2622 ace2 is also identified as the cell surface receptor for sars-cov-2 s-protein17 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov is expressed ubiquitously in many tissues  endothelia and epithelia  including but not limited to kidney liver lung intestine and interestingly also on immune cells eg t cells activated natural killer nk cells and myeloid cells23 dpp4 is known to play a major role in glucose metabolism which may explain the high prevalence of diabetes observed in severe mers-cov cases2425 ace2 the receptor for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 although ubiquitously present in many tissues it is primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the tracheobronchial tree and respiratory system kidneys digestive tract cardiovascular system and skin26 ace2 is a membrane protein with protease activity that plays a critical role in the regulation of blood pressure by catalyzing the cleavage of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii into the vasodilator angiotensin 17 to antagonize the potentiating function of ace127 attenuation of pulmonary ace2 activity was found to impair bradykinin and facilitate lipopolysaccharide lps-induced neutrophil infiltration28 such a process has long been known to be sufficient to induce respiratory symptoms eg airflow obstruction and increased airway hyperreactivity and inflammation eg expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines29 it is apparent therefore that the elevated ace2 expression in lung tissue plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of the acute outcome of infection caused by sars-cov and sars-cov-2 indeed since ace2 is the same receptor for both viral conditions they may share the same target organs pathogenic mechanisms clinical manifestations and  possibly  treatment optionsfollowing the binding of viral s-protein to human cell receptor the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane permitting entry of the viral genome to human cells the receptor-binding domain rbd of s-protein determines its binding affinity to the human cell surface receptor an observation that can be employed in vaccine development in the determined effort to develop a sars-cov-2 vaccine the molecular structure of its s-protein has been mapped30 it was found that the predominant state of the trimer has one of the rbds rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation and binds ace2 with higher affinity 10- to 20-fold than does sars-cov s-protein16 such higher affinity between the s-protein and ace2 in sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov may help explain the elevated infectivity and rapid person-to-person spread of sars-cov-2 relative to sars-cova comparative and systematic genetic analysis of ace2 gene in different populations was conducted recently31 the coding-region variants in ace2 may affect the expression of ace2 receptors this study indicated no evidence of coronavirus s-protein binding-resistant ace2 mutants in different populations however the data of variant distribution and allele frequencies were thought to contribute to the role of ace2 in acute lung injury and lung function31 the study also concluded that east asian populations have much higher allele frequency in the expression quantitative trait loci eqtls the genomic loci that explain variation in mrna expression levels variants associated with higher ace2 expression in tissues this was suggested to influence different levels of susceptibility or response to sars-cov-2 in different populations under similar conditions this observation warrants the need for further population-based genetic epidemiological studies on the potential effect of variants in the functional coding region of ace2 among different populations to characterize its role in the spread of covid-19 disease severity and response to treatmentcoronavirus infections were shown to induce massive synthesis and release of cytokines and chemokines and lead to non-specific activation of mononuclear macrophages that  in a positive feedback loop  further release high levels of cytokines see below such an excessive synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infections and also a number of chronic diseases results in a state of hypercytokinemia also known as cytokine storm32 and can lead to severe outcome eg multiple organ failure33 pneumonia cases from sars-cov and mers-cov were invariably accompanied by extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and hypercytokinemia leading to acute lung injury ards and death34 current evidence suggests that severe covid-19 cases have significantly elevated levels of cytokines  compared to non-severe cases  similar to that observed in sars-cov and mers-cov interleukins such as il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf c-x-c motif chemokine 10 cxcl10 also known as interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a and tumor necrosis factor  tnf were particularly and significantly elevated in severe covid-19 cases35 other inflammatory factors such as il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf interferon  ifn platelet-derived growth factor pdgf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf were also increased35 several studies reported elevated levels of il-6 in non-survival or critically-ill cases compared to survivals or those with a mild outcome113637 furthermore severe covid-19 cases with ards and hypercoagulation leading to thrombosis thrombocytopenia and gangrene had persistent very high levels of erythematosus sedimentation rate esr and c-reactive protein crp accompanied by elevated levels of il-6 tnf il-1 il-8 and il2r38the extensive synthesis of cytokines is known to stimulate massive proliferation of monocyte-macrophages and induce excessive apoptosis of lymphocytes disrupting the immune system to develop a status of immunodeficiency that can lead to secondary infections3439 indeed early stages of covid-19 were shown to be characterized by a decrease in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes that progressively decline as the disease develops into a severe outcome35 similar findings  with comparable lung lesions  were also reported in the severe sars-cov3940 and mers-cov41 hypercytokinemia has been also noted in sars-cov39 and mers-cov41 and was suggested to result in inflammatory lesions in the lungs and extensive inflammatory reactions and necrosis in the spleen lymph nodes and blood vessels such a profile of hypercytokinemia was further suggested to be a major causative factor in exacerbating lung damage and other fatal complications38 the profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines in coronavirus diseases may therefore be a common pathophysiological basis in pneumonias resulting from these infections3442 direct evidence for the role of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the pathophysiology of coronavirus infections was noted however from sars-cov cases3940 where ace2-positive cells were shown to express significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as mcp1 transforming growth factor 1 tgf-1 tnf il-1 and il-6 than ace2-negative or non-infected cells40upon infection the innate immunity-mediated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines by target cells recruits and activates immune cells including monocytes-macrophages lymphocytes and neutrophils into the site of infection43 based on our understanding of the coronavirus-induced pneumonia the accumulation of these cells in the lung and blood vessel walls mediate inflammatory reactions to clear the infection and further synthesize cytokines to stimulate immunity leading to a state of hypercytokinemia3941 such a local reaction aggravates the lung and vascular tissue injury and may lead to lung exudate pulmonary edema hyaline membrane formation and mucus cell activation to block the airway ultimately manifesting in ards16 early stage of this process is accompanied by extensive lymphocyte apoptotic cell death that attenuates cellular immune system leading to a state of immunodeficiency3941 this complication may culminate to respiratory failure systemic hypoxia multiple organ failure and death such a proposed range of clinical events may permit identifying a set of biomarkers along the innate immunity pathway related to the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines for early prediction of the severe outcome of infection it may also delineate effective avenues for the treatment of early disease stages as well as in critically-ill patients however much is yet to be learned  particularly in the case of sars-cov-2  to introduce such a proposition into clinical practicesinnate immunity-related inflammatory response has long been characterized to play a critical role in the bodys response to infection33 several studies have demonstrated that hypercytokinemia is the principal immunopathological mechanism that contributes to severe clinical presentation in patients with infectious diseases4447 the genes that code for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines responsible for hypercytokinemia include tnf ifn il-1 il-6 il-8 il-9 il-12 il-15 and il-1744 these genes are polymorphic and certain alleles have been associated with susceptibility to a wide range of infectious conditions as well as their severe outcome4546 although these mediators are principally related to immune reactions they can also influence functions of epithelial and endothelial cells smooth muscle and adipose tissue and play a role in sepsis shock ards and responses to toxic medication4748 in general clinical signs and symptoms associated with hypercytokinemia include headaches muscle pain nausea diarrhea vasodilatation and hypotension47several variants in the genes encoding for cytokines eg tnf rs1800750 ga il1b rs16944 ga ccl rs2282691 at and ifitm3 rs12252 tc have been associated with risk of an array of clinical manifestations in infectious diseases3249 furthermore elevated levels of the resultant pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were found in the plasma of patients with ards in response to infection1650 previous studies examining the relationship between infectious diseases and cytokine markers suggest that host genetic factors may indeed influence these biomarkers and the subsequent disease severity5054 this relationship may shed some light on the interindividual differences in response to sars-cov-2 infection and other coronavirus diseases and warrants analysis of the genetic variants in cytokine genes in coronavirus patients linking these genetic polymorphisms to the extent of hypercytokinemia and the individuals response to infection may identify novel approaches related to the risk of disease severity as well as effective measures of prevention and control in this context single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in cytokine genes can be employed to determine whether the patients innate immune status is prone to hypercytokinemia in sars-cov-2 virus infection as proposed in other infectious diseases3244-47 attenuating the effect of these genes ie their role in extensive cytokine synthesis can provide an approach for early intervention in subjects prone to hypercytokinemia upon infection for example we325556 and others57 have proposed a utility of some nutritional factors to impact the expression of cytokine genes as in the early prevention of a number of infectious and chronic diseases furthermore the use of il-6 pathways blockers and other biologic drugs currently prescribed for rheumatology was suggested to be employed in targeting inflammation in patients prone to hypercytokinemia58the systemic nature of coronavirus infection outcomes is perhaps due to the ubiquitous expression of the virus receptors ace2 in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and dpp4 in mers-cov such an expression may further relate to the common hypercytokinemic responses in the lungs and vasculature characterized in these infections the pathophysiological mechanism of covid-19 and other coronavirus diseases may then relate to this state of hypercytokinemia that both exacerbates the inflammatory lesions in the target tissues and induces massive t cell apoptotic death and a subsequent vulnerability to immune deficiency furthermore the notable higher affinity of sars-cov-2 s-protein to ace2 compared to sars-cov16 where a relatively lesser level of the virus can result in disease manifestation may have influenced the extensive worldwide spread of covid-19 within this context it is important to note that although respiratory transmission was considered as the principal route in the disease spread59 the ubiquitous expression of ace2 receptors in many human tissues and organs suggests that new transmission routes eg aerosols and direct contact should be also taken into considerationthe interindividual differences in response to covid-19 infection may relate to the genetic polymorphisms in genes regulating the virus s-protein binding receptor ace2 gene and those modulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines eg tnf ifn il-1 il-6 il-8 il-9 il-12 il-15 and il-17 genes these genes influence both target organ function and injury31 as well as host immune response to infection4546 various combinations of these genes can emerge to differentially determine the infection outcome in different individuals populations and sub-populations this observation underlines the necessity to conduct more systematic population-based genetic epidemiological studies to elucidate the influence of sequence variation in this array of genes on the response to and treatment of viral infection factors that modulate the expression and activity of these markers eg at1 receptor blockers arbs or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists mras for ace26061 or anti-inflammatory factors for cytokines62 may need to be further considered in studies with a systematic population-based approachoverall extensive research is warranted in many areas related to coronavirus diseases particularly covid-19 work needs to be developed in areas related to the transmission route pathological mechanism natural history and prognosis of the disease approaches for effective therapy and vaccine development ultimately the establishment of effective public health measures for disease prevention and control is critical both regionally and globally in this respect  and given the varying rates of disease prevalence among the different world regions there is a need to characterize the effect of health inequities and inequalities within and between countries on public health and healthcare response to covid-19 the rapid and vast spread of the disease substantiate an urgency to develop a global policy coherence and complementation between public health authorities around the world that takes into consideration the well-known influence of socioeconomic status and inter-population differences on healthclassified within the coronaviridae family sars-cov-2 shares the main common characteristics of this family coronaviruses are enveloped with large 30-kb single-stranded positive-sense rna 17 their genome is divided into two parts 5 two-thirds and 3 one-third with the former including open reading frames orf1a and orf1b that encode pp1a and pp1ab two large polyproteins that can be cleaved to nonstructural proteins nsp116 required for the synthesis of new viral genetic material the rest of the genome includes genes that encode the structural proteins to produce virions and accessory genes that play a role in the host response 17structural proteins include the spike s glycoprotein known for its pathogenicity that comprises two functional subunits s1 as the receptor-binding domain and s2 that mediates fusion between the virus envelope and host cell membrane other coronavirus proteins include nucleocapsid n involved in genome replication a membrane m protein from the host endoplasmic reticulum or golgi responsible for virus assembly and the envelope protein e figure 2a table 1 sars-cov-2 highly resembles sars-cov-1 sharing 77 similarity with the residual amino acids of the s protein 1 also the similarity of n m and 3a proteins in sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 implies a similar pathogenic pathway sars-cov-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a cell surface receptor that converts the vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin-ii to the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 and is highly expressed in the vascular endothelia lung kidney small intestine epithelial cells immune cells and testis 1819 following binding to ace2 the virus enters the cell through either an endosome in acidic environments or by s glycoprotein cleavage with host cell proteases such as tmprss2 and furin 2022 using their own rna polymerase coronaviruses replicate their genome in the host cell cytoplasm and employ the host ribosome machinery to produce proteins subsequent viral assembly occurs in the host endoplasmic reticulumgolgi intermediate complex and mature virions are released through a secretory mechanism in smooth-walled vesicles resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress figure 2bthe human body uses pattern recognition receptors to identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous danger or damage-associated molecular patterns the most well-known pattern recognition receptors include the toll-like receptors tlrs cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i the rig-i-like receptor rlr and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor nlr tlrs such as tlr7 are induced in response to recognized particles 2324 including single-stranded rna viruses and stimulate proinflammatory cytokines and interferons ifns type i and iii 25 the latter released from virus-infected cells upregulates ifn-stimulated genes which is a first step in limiting viral entry or viral replication 26 at later stages ifns can inhibit viral assembly the viral spread and modulate the immune system by promoting macrophage natural killer nk- t- and b-cell activities 27 it has been suggested that coronavirus can antagonize ifns and thereby evade the immune system 28rig-i-like receptors which reside on mitochondria can detect rna viruses and activate mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins in turn increase proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin il-6 tumor necrosis factor- tnf- that are related to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-b pathway interferon regulatory factors and inflammasome-related cytokines il-1 and il-18 23 elevated inflammasome pathways in normal aging have been associated with age-related chronic diseases 2930 by further stimulating inflammasome pathway activity viral infections can exacerbate age-related impairment of immunological responses with aging the decline in innate immunity attenuates ifn responses to viral infection in neutrophils monocytes and macrophages and nk cells 24273132 moreover costimulatory signals are reduced from the antigen-presenting cells including macrophages b cells nk and dendritic cells that are required to activate t cells 32coronaviruses have been shown to activate both the nlrp3 inflammasome and the nf-b pathway 3334 of particular importance are elevated levels of tnf--converting enzyme tace a proteolytic enzyme in the processing of tnf- tnf receptors tnfrs and ace2 both ace2 and tace levels are associated with poor prognosis in heart failure in addition tnfr-1 and tnfr-2 are strongly associated with kidney failure in older adults 35 ace2 is an enzyme that promotes the formation of angiotensin 1-7 which has anti-inflammatory functions 3638 however ace2 expression levels in human aging and ace2 activity upon sars-cov-2 infection remain to be elucidatedmoreover in response to viral infections plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level increases to neutralize proteases such as tmprss2 and thus reduces the infectivity transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta increases in response to persistent inflammation and is known to trigger serpine1 expression the gene encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 which further increases tgf-beta levels 26 of note increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level a known marker of senescence 39 may increase thromboembolism and coagulopathy which are risk factors for acute cardiovascular events and stroke 26 similar to mesr-cov sars-cov-2 also has been reported to have a furin-like cleavage site 40 furin another host cell protease stimulates both nlrp3 and nf-b inflammatory pathways and activates tgf-beta 41 notably tgf-beta and growth differentiation factor 15 a member of tgf-beta superfamily are known markers associated with aging 42 as well as significant prognostic markers in acute respiratory distress syndrome 4344adaptive immunity that identifies and responds to specific pathogens includes humoral and cellular immunities which are mediated by b cells and cd8 and cd4 t cells respectively b lymphocytes are triggered to differentiate into immunoglobin-producing plasma cells by cytokine production from cd4 cells 42 increased levels of all immunoglobulins ig including iga from respiratory mucosal cells igm and igg have been reported in response to coronavirus 23 igm is the first antibody secreted in response to acute viral infection igg produced later and enhanced upon reinfection facilitates phagocytosis of infected cells and antibody-dependent cellular toxicity by both nk and cd8 cells 45 with aging there is a shift from the nave toward memory b cells alterations in the key stimulatory factors mediating the b-cell response to antigens as well as reduced capacity for antigen recognition sites on antibodies to recognize novel pathogens moreover in response to antiviral vaccines long-lived plasma cells decrease 46with aging in addition to the decreased number of nave t cells communication between t cells and antigen-presenting cells which is required to convert nave t cells to memory cells is reduced 47upon viral infection the activated cytotoxic cd8 cells release the lysing enzymes to degrade infected cells and viral genomes if cd8 cells fail to eliminate the virus cytokines released from cd4 t effector cells induce augmented inflammatory responses 48 decreased numbers of nave cd8 t cells and reduced t-cell receptor diversityas well as alterations in distribution and function of effector memory and regulatory cd8 t cellslead to impaired recognition of new antigens and accumulation of dysfunctional memory t cells 4951 of note transcription factor foxo3 that is expressed on t cells was shown to play an essential role in the regulation of t-cell functions in response to pathogens 52notably an age-dependent sex discrepancy in immune systems has been demonstrated 53 and the incidence of coronavirus infection has also been reported to be higher in men than women with sars-cov-1 viral titers and the accumulation of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in the lungs were higher among men than women 5455 a study of epigenomics and transcriptomics of immune cells has suggested a bimodal reduction in b-cell function in men first in the early 30s and then at age 65 years and older 53 the sex- and age-dependent immune cell-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic discrepancy can also underlie the sex and age differences in severity of covid-19 symptoms moreover estrogen receptor signaling 56 variability in testosterone levels and androgen receptor expression have been implicated in the variability of immune responses 57 notably androgen receptor element genes are upstream to the tmprss2 transcription start site and regulate its expression 58 while more rigorous epidemiological data on sex and age distribution of covid-19 are warranted 59 more investigation on sex- and age-dependent immune response to rna viral infections will shed more light on covid-19 severitythe accumulation of somatic mutations genomic instability and attenuated dna repair have been shown in aging immune cells the overexpression of oxidative stress seen with a viral infection along with attenuated dna repair capacity could accelerate genome instability and apoptosis in noninfected cells 6061among dna repair mechanisms p53 plays a vital role in response to low levels of stress and protects cells from oxidative damage conversely higher levels of oxidative stress eg increased inflammatory responses secondary to viral infection result in persistent activation of p53 and increased mitochondrial outer membrane permeability which in turn leads to apoptosis figure 3 62 although p53 can downregulate coronavirus replication via regulation of the cell cycle 63 the coronavirus papain-like protease degrades p53 and allows replication of infected cells 64 further the dna damage response can play a role in the pathogenesis of rna viruses through induction of apoptosis deleterious somatic mutations and excessive stimulation of inflammatory immune responses figure 3 65 additionally coronavirus can inhibit the activity of the cyclin-dependent protein complex resulting in inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein which is an important tumor suppressor protein and cell cycle check 66of note coronavirus accessory proteins such as the 7a protein also mediate apoptosis by interfering with bcl-x an antiapoptotic protein additionally coronavirus accessory proteins 3a and 9b as well as structural proteins such as s e m and n modulate apoptosis by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating the p38 mapk pathway figure 3 6768collectively adverse cellular responses to dna damage and diminished dna repair capacity have been associated with genome instability and a decline in immune system function this hallmark of aging not only is likely to be a risk for poor outcomes in older adults but also is likely to be amplified by coronavirus infectionmitochondria through several functions play pivotal roles in cell homeostasis they play a powerhouse role with metabolic oxidation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the production of adenosine triphosphate via the electron transport chain and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids with aging mitochondrial phosphorylation capacity is decreased accordingly the increased energy expenditure secondary to a cytokine storm can lead to a nonadaptive state overwhelming the metabolic reserve capacity of mitochondria among older adults who have covid-19 as a normal body function against pathogens mitochondria also produce reactive oxygen species ros 69 however excessive ros production can be damaging in a similar way to encountering coronavirus infection 70 moreover augmented ros production known as one of the contemporary theories of aging has been associated with age-related diseases and decreased life span 71 though diminished with aging detoxifying systems including catalase superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase with selenium and magnesium as their cofactors 72 vitamins e and c and coenzyme q10 all help minimize ros-induced tissue damage 73 supplementation with coenzyme q10 an integral part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been linked with antioxidant activity less severe respiratory viral infections and less severe inflammatory response 74as mentioned above mitochondria regulate innate and adaptive immunity eg viral rna activates mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins via rig-i on mitochondria which in turn stimulate nf-b nlrp3 pathways and interferon regulatory factors mitochondria also mediate cytotoxic responses to lung cell stress 7576together the combination of impaired respiration diminished adenosine triphosphate production increased ros and reduced detoxification capacity with dysregulated immune functions seems likely to play a pivotal role in the increased inflammation and severity of covid-19with aging epigenomic alterations play a pivotal role in distinguishing immune cell phenotypes and regulating inflammatory responses to intrinsic or extrinsic stressors age is one of the main drivers of variations in chromatin structure measured by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing atac-seq 53 specific epigenetic modifications such as chromatin accessibility via histone acetylationmethylation play essential roles in response to viral infection 7779 shared epigenomic patterns of aging result in decreases in nave t cells and increases in monocytes and cytotoxic cell functions however the magnitude of alterations is more significant in men than in women with an accompanied loci-specific methylation decline in the b cells 53 as such sex and age differences in epigenetic patterns of immune cells in part can explain variability in the severity of covid-19moreover the epigenetic changes in cpg-sites located in subtelomeric regions that control innate immunity can mediate inflammatory responses to covid-19 chronic viral infection can accelerate aging as measured by the epigenetic clock 80 it remains to be elucidated whether these epigenetic clocks based on chronological or biological age 8081 can predict the severity of covid-19 and subsequent exacerbation of chronic diseases in covid-19 survivorstelomeres which are repetitive nucleotides ttagggn at the ends of each chromosome play a role in maintaining genome stability and regulate innate immunity in response to viral infection regions near telomeres called subtelomeres contain cg-enriched genes that regulate innate immunity 82 influenced by telomere length these genes regulate telomere repeat-containing rna terra transcription and their expression can be upregulated in response to viral infection via activation of interferon-stimulated genes therefore diverse telomere lengths often observed with aging immune cells 83 can underlie differential responses to viral challenge 82 another consequence of telomere attrition is the premature induction of genome instability in viral-specific cd8 memory t cells that results in senescent or antiapoptotic cells 84 thus telomere attrition coupled with dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection is another hallmark of aging that can contribute to the severe outcomes in older adults with covid-19the process of autophagy is modified by aging and thus can play a role in controlling viral infection through diminished viral degradation as well as by dysregulating innate and adaptive immunity 85the autophagy process includes the functions of several protein complexes in the absence of stress the mtorc1ulk12 complex inhibits the initiation of autophagy under stress including viral infections mtorc1 is inhibited which subsequently activates a series of proteins that result in the induction of autophagy and virion encapsulation and degradation of viral particles 86moreover autophagy regulates the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection by inducing antigen-presenting cells such as b cells macrophages and dendritic cells antigen-presenting cells in turn present viral antigens to cd4 t cells to release cytokines and regulate adaptive immune responses the early autophagic process induces the release of interferon-gamma ifn- from cd4 t cells to promote cd8 t cells nk cells and macrophages in response to viral infection 87 moreover the autophagic process controls the inflammatory response preventing the accumulation of ros and the inflammasome pathway via targeting pro-il-1 for lysosomal degradation 88 while some viruses evade the direct autophagy-mediated function immune-mediated effects of autophagy can still control viral infection and inflammatory-mediated tissue damage therefore impaired autophagy a hallmark of aging possibly contributes to the severity of covid-19 and poor outcomes in older patients niclosamide and valinomycin two fda-approved drugs for other purposes enhance autophagy and diminish viral replication 89 however the antiviral effect of polyamines such as spermidine a bolster of autophagy has been debated 90 of note rapamycin and its analogs and also vitamin d3 drugs with suggestive antiaging effects have antiviral efficacy by increasing autophagy 91 despite its immunosuppressive effects in transplant patients rapamycin inhibition of mtorc1 improves immune function in older adults and increases the response to vaccines some clinical trials using rapamycin have shown no serious side effects in humans 9295 therefore rapamycin by improving immunity is expected to improve outcomes in older adults with covid-19clinical manifestations of covid-19 have indicated that hostvirus interactions such as cytokine storm and coagulopathy underlying comorbidities and possibly polypharmacy are all possible culprits for the spectrum of covid-19 severity to combat both acute and chronic conditions related to covid-19 enhancing response to the vaccine and antiviral therapies using drugs that boost immune system response and enhance body system health is warranted older adults with an attenuated response to vaccine or antiviral medications might skew the pandemic figure toward epidemy in the older population therefore some antiaging modalities possibly attenuate the severity of covid-19 and increase response to vaccines when they become available thus combating sars-cov-2 requires methods that go beyond direct targeting of the virus to include those approaches that support bodily system function via improving immunity especially in older adultsas such interfering with pathways associated with the hallmarks of aging has the potential to improve the response to antiviral drugs 96 potential drugs include agents that reduce mitochondrial ros production and boost the immune system rapamycin has been shown to increase the immune response to the influenza vaccine and boost immune function in older adults 9394 metformin an old antidiabetic drug and also a candidate antiaging modality interferes with viral replication and hostviral interactions 97 increasing sirt6 an enzyme regulating multiple age-related signaling pathways has been shown to reduce the immense inflammatory response to the fatal dengue virus infection 98 some of the chloroquine-related family drugs which are treatment candidates for prevention and treatment of covid-19 also interfere with beta-galactosidase a marker of senescence in cells 99 however the efficacy and safety of chloroquine drugs in older adults require more dataalthough lists of drugs and vitamins have been suggested 100 at this writing none of the ongoing clinical trials has considered recruiting older patients thus the impact of all potential therapies and safety in older adults remains to be determined we suggest an accelerated understanding of the interactions between covid-19 and the host hallmarks of aging in order to identify biomarkers with which to screen individuals at higher risk understanding the mechanisms of covid-19 will likely arise from comparing the disease risks and response to treatments in young men and women with covid-19 versus older patientsto do this we need to include older adults in clinical trialsthe covid-19 outbreak is a worldwide public health problem with health consequences that are likely to persist for many years currently older adults and patients with comorbidities and other unknown risk factors have developed more severe and critical complications and therefore are at higher mortality risk both the incidence and severity of disease appear to be more prominent in men than women which can be partially explained by both age-dependent and -independent sex dimorphism in the immune system coronaviruses use host factors for replication these factors are affected by age and the same mechanisms as those linked with the hallmarks of aging some of the hallmarks of aging coupled with immune system responses and comorbidities seem likely to play a pivotal role in the severity of covid-19 innate immunity with cytokine storms coagulopathy neutralizing antibodies cellular immune responses such as cd4 and cd8 t cells b cells nk cells monocytes and macrophages and inflammatory host responses along with specific virus antigen epitopesall have interactive roles in disease development diminished reserves and stress response capacity coupled with the reduced immune response to vaccines place older adults at higher risk for critical health complications and mortality especially during times of acute stress together with antiviral interventions the key hallmarks of aging can offer insights for the identification and treatment of patients most at risk and help elucidate the basis for age and sex differences in response to such stressors application of candidate antiaging drugs such as rapamycin and metformin and antiviral drugs with potential senolytic effects possibly boost the immune system of older adults further investigation requires immediate attention such drugs can also prevent the possible post-covid-19 accumulation of morbidities and accelerated biology of agingthe current sars-cov-2 pandemic challenges the health systems across the world to an unprecedented degree 1 the scientific community was put to a test in order to evaluate the risk factors associated with the viral response since the most sensitive patients in respect to the respiratory response to the pathogen are those in a prerequisite unbalanced health conditionobesity is one of the most important conditions that increases exponentially the mortality risk of the sars-cov-2 patients 2 the center for disease control and prevention cdc determined the most important groups with higher risk for severe illness noting that besides obesity asthma chronic lung disease diabetes serious heart conditions chronic kidney disease severe obesity age 65 years and older people in nursing homes or long-term care facilities immune-compromised and liver disease patients are the most vulnerable to the complications examining the respective list we can conclude that most of the high risk group patients have conditions associated frequently or consequences of obesity diabetes heart conditions asthma etc 35the strong correlation between obesity and the complications of viral infections was previously pointed out for the influenza virus as well as for the previous corona-viruses causing wide spread infections sars mers this association is important when analyzing results since there is an increased genetic similarity between sars-cov-2 determining covid-19 sars-cov 80 and mers-cov 50 6 studies show that obese patients are at higher risk of hospital admission regardless of their viral status and also obese patients are at higher risk of hospitalization compared to normo-ponderal ones when affected by influenza 78literature data state that there is a direct metabolic link between the state of inflammation such as the one associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome and the cytokine storm contributing to the respiratory decline of covid-19 patients the entry of the virus to the cell is mediated by the ace2 ectoenzyme located at the cell surface in the lungs and by the serine protease tmprss2 thus the correlation with the renin-angiotensin system is obvious indeed ace1 activity is increased and ace2 inhibited while angiotensin ii activates angiotensin receptors 1 and 2 at1r at2r mediating a pro-inflammatory response and a consequent increase of vascular permeability importantly this metabolic imbalance is aggravated by pre-existing diabetes or hypertension usual consequences of obesity 910 moreover some drugs frequently used for treatment of obese patients complications such as antihypertensives statins thiazolidinediones have the tendency to up-regulate ace2 thus increasing the viral up-take 1113 previous preclinical studies in an animal model showed that the association of diabetes with mers-cov dampened the ability of the body to engage an effective immune response and induced a poor recovery after illness 14the disease burden of obesity is obvious in hospitalized covid-19 patients and has strong relationship with the development of obese-related major and lethal complications obesogenic comorbidities 1516 have become major health problems in hospitalized patients including increased insulin resistance 1720 and type 2 diabetes 21 fatty liver diseases 2223 vascular inflammation and coronary heart disease 2425 immune diseases 26 risk of cerebral ischemia and brain injury 27 atherosclerotic vascular disease and myocardial infarction 28 as well as cancers 29 adipose tissue and adipocytes produce leptin and other molecules that affect the cardiovascular function the production of these substances is perpetrated through distinct endocrine autocrine and paracrine mechanisms and believed to lead to cytokine-mediated inflammatory changes in the liver and systemic inflammation and atherosclerosis 3033smethers and rolls 34 reported that in obese adults the correlation between unhealthy eating patterns or uncontrolled eating management and immune deficiency is highly complex systematic reviews 3536 research studies 37 and meta-analyses 38 have documented that high-energy diets are a risk factor for weight gain nutritional patterns collectively termed as western diet include trans- and saturated high-fats and cholesterol high-protein high-sugar excess salt intake low in complex carbohydrates fiber micronutrients such as vitamin d 39 and are all associated with impaired inflammatory pathways 4047 frequent consumption of processed fast foods or foods contaminated with pesticide residues predispose individuals to inflammation through the increased uptake of lipopolysaccharide from microbes in the gut because of increased gut leakiness 48 as well as promote obesity and metabolic syndrome 15 furthermore unhealthy diet has been correlated to autoimmune pathology such as multiple sclerosis 49 rheumatoid arthritis 50 inflammatory bowel disease 51 systemic lupus erythematosus 52 and psoriasis through specific deregulations of t cells treg that particularly promote leptin 53 and th17-biased immunity partly dependent on increased il-6 54 importantly excess dietary salt intake is associated with obesity 55 hypertension cardiovascular disease and stroke 56 through the enhancement of pathogenic th17 cells 57 as well as p38mapk and nuclear factor of activated t cells 5 nfat5 activation 58 due to cellular response to hyperosmotic environments 59the pulmonary tissue is the most sensitive human tissue in intensive care unit icu covid-19 patients systemic hypoxia due to reduced pulmonary functions increased adipokines and cytokines gut 60 and pulmonary 61 microbiome alterations 62 cardiopulmonary vascular and epithelial complications due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 63 are cofactors associated with critical illness among hospitalized patients with covid-19 disease reported in zhanjiang province 64 and jiangsu province china 65 as well as in new york city usa 66 petrilli et al pointed out that in covid-19 icu patients the highest risks are exhibited by those aged 75 years body mass index bmi 40 and heart failure moreover strong critical illness parameters were admission oxygen saturation 88 d-dimer 2500 ferritin 2500 as well as c-reactive protein crp 200aging seems to present with a great variety of patterns and unique sets of obesity and age-related disease among older adults independent of their bmi blood pressure and blood lipid concentrations 67 decline in immune function is observed known as immune-senescence leading to increased susceptibility and exhibiting more serious complications as compared to younger individuals reflecting the deterioration of function in both the acquired and innate immune systems 204568 in elderly most cells produce cytokineschemokinesadipokines and soluble mediators of inflammation due to inflammation-related gene expression by ros induced lipid oxidation-derived products and formation of lipid droplets within the monocytesmacrophages 69 ageing is also associated with a multi-factorial decrease of t cell function and number t-cell subset composition and functional capacity fewer naive t cells more memory cells in the circulation thymic involution and decreased thymic output and naive t cells as well as increased memory cells in the circulation 70 furthermore modifications of immunoglobulin levels micronutrient deficiencies 71 and biological dysfunctions including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production thus increasing inflammation as well as hospitalization and death have been documented 72in march 2020 1 a review was published on the 2019 outbreak covid-19 supporting that covid-19 lethality is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population in obese covid-19 patients the adipose tissue interacts with the immune system facilitating the severity and lethality of the disease through biochemical molecular cellular as well as immune interplaythe world health organization who has characterized both the covid-19 outbreak and obesity epidemic as international public health emergencies global clinical and epidemiological observations confirm that covs can cause more severe symptoms and complications in people with obesity-related conditions indeed wu et al 4 established the correlation between obesity-induced immune deficiency and covid-19 adverse outcomesimmunologically obesity is characterized as a chronic sub-clinical inflammatory morbid entity which can impact the immune responses to infectious diseases through direct indirect and epigenetic 7374 mechanisms evans et al 75 described various fat tissue-associated cytokines adipokines that are produced and released in proportion to the amount of visceral adipose tissue in the body serum amyloid-a is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes that can act directly on macrophages to increase their production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor tnf- interleukin il-1 and il-6 and resistin 222375 indeed alam et al 76 reported in detail that the majority of respective adipokines are inflammatory mediators such as il-8 pai-1 mcp-1 il-6 il-1ra tnf- stnfrii and il-18in addition il-8 il-10 interferon gamma ifn- and inducible protein 10 ip-10 or cxcl10 have been shown to be associated with excessive body weight 77 obesity-induced adipokine production such as leptin adiponectin ratio increases insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes resulting in inability to feel and detect satiety leptin in the arcuate nucleus of mediobasal hypothalamus 78 moreover adverse effects are evident despite high energy stores on hunger food energy use physical exercise and energy balance as well as on hippocampus-mediated deficit in learning and memory functions 79 furthermore the prolonged ifn responses during persistent chronic inflammation and obesogenesis comprise reciprocal causality between virus susceptibility and obesity 80 additional epigenetic signatures in obesity are likewise altered including methylation andor histone acetylation levels in genes involved in specific and general metabolic processes altering thus the metabolic phenotype of the offspring 8183 although no specific therapy exists to block the effects of these factors recognizing the high risk and anticipating inflammation-associated complications of adipokine release is an important part of optimal patient managementobesity can reduce immune cell functionality induce gut microbiomevirome imbalance inflammatory cytokine phenotype and increase antiviral antimicrobial and anticoagulant resistance as depicted in fig 1 in overweight children anti-tetanus igg antibodies were significantly lower compared to normal weight controls due to the chronic low grade inflammation expressed by the higher levels of il-6 84 similarly researchers reported in a 2019 study that reduction or elimination of food in overweightobese adults can lead to a decreased igg concentration over time 85the mechanisms involved in increased risk for higher covid-19 prevalence and mortality in obese are correlated with specific fat-resident regulatory t cells 86 treg and particularly promotion of th17 t-cell sub-lineage-biased immunity 8788 indeed these processes are partly dependent on increased il-6 as well as il-23il-17 other inflammatory obesity-associated plasma cytokine expression such as tnf- transforming growth factor tgf pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 89 furthermore in this mechanism increased crp levels 90 and disrupted tight junctions in pulmonary epithelia 91 have also been implicated additionally ahmed and gaffen 92 argued that obesity selectively promotes expansion of the th17 t-cell lineage exacerbating immune diseases in specific organs in obese individuals such as brain and gut according to the results of new experimental and human studies th17 cells are also associated with autoimmune disease such as multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis 93 but also glomerulonephritis asthma and pandemic h1n1 influenza virus 94strissel et al 95 demonstrated that adipose tissue inflammation as well as the resistance to insulin action in adipocytes are accelerated by a high fat diet this induces the mobilization of t cells predominantly cd4 and cd8 to adipose tissue and associated increased synthesis of ifn thus contributing to the local inflammatory responses fig 2 inflammatory t helper cells secreting cytokines including il-1 il-6 il-8 il-10 tnf- granulocyte- and macrophage-colony stimulating factor gm-csf are present both in obese phenotype and covid-19 patients affecting prognosis pathogenesis and fatalityaccording to zhou et al 96 covid-19 entry into the cell leads to over-production of inflammatory cytokines importantly in icu patients infected with sars-cov-2 the expression of specific proteins increased significantly suggesting an exhausted status of t cells covid-19 icu patients with severe pneumonia showed correlated higher percentage of gm-csf and il-6cd4 t cells the inflammatory signature of monocytes cd14cd16 with high expression of il-6 is similar in icu covid-19 patients and obese adults with inflammatory phenotype therefore activated immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in large numbers and exert a damaging role especially in obese covid-19 patients with severe pulmonary syndrome caused by pathogenic gm-csf th1 cells and inflammatory cd14 and cd16 monocytes indeed a cytokine-abundant environment aberrant pathogenic th1 cells inflammatory cd14 cd16 monocytes the high expression of il-6 and intense inflammatory monocytes infiltration to pulmonary circulation accelerate the inflammation and affect pulmonary immune-pathology leading to deleterious clinical manifestations lung functional disability and even acute mortalityon april 15 2020 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc based on currently available information and clinical expertise advised that older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions including obesity with a bmi of 40 or above might be at higher risk for complications and severe illness from covid-19 in this report emphasis is given on ascertainment that severe obesity increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 3obesity increased food intake nutrientenergy imbalance affect in a bidirectional way the immune deficiency especially in vulnerable populations patients with type 2 diabetes and those with metabolic syndrome pre-diabetes may be up to ten times more likely to die when they become ill with covid-19 9 the mortality rate for young people who had to be admitted to a hospital with severe respiratory illness due to covid-19 was approximately 2 but this increased to 14 for the most vulnerable such as covid-19 patients with obesity and related co-morbidity 97 for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus systemic vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis treatment may include drugs including methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine plaquenil that suppress the immune system to treat the disease and symptoms making immune-compromised patients more vulnerable to covid-19 infection 98foods may have calories but do not contain vitamins minerals antioxidants etc indicating that increased calorie intake in relation to nutrient intake is the main reason behind the immunodeficiency today for example even short-term severe vitamin d deficiency 99 may directly promote hypertension and impacts on renin-angiotensin system components that could contribute to target-organ damage 100 nutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent in the united states and elsewhere increasing much of the consequent risk of premature aging chronic disease and covid-19 prevalence and mortality due to acceleration of the risk associated with aging 101in addition low dietary antioxidant intake 102 occupational exposures 103 and increased genetically modified foods 104 including cotton seedcanola seedcorn oil eggplant fruits and vegetables eg papaya potatoes tomatoes lettuce may enhance immune system deficiency 105lipotoxicity is a condition induced by the aggregation of intermediate lipids to non-fatty tissue which leads to cell malfunction and death 106 tissues that are usually affected include kidneys liver heart and skeletal muscle lipotoxicity is believed to play a role in heart failure obesity and diabetes and is estimated to affect approximately 25 of the adult american population 2045107108under physiological conditions there is a balance between cellular lipid production and their oxidation or transport however this balance might be disrupted when the cells are lipotoxic that is when an imbalance between the amount of cellular lipids produced and the amount consumed is evident thus upon fatty acids entry to cells conversion to various types of storage lipids is initiated triacylglycerol tg consisting of a glycerin molecule bound to three fatty acids is established as the safest type of intracellular lipid storage apart from tg fatty acids can be converted to fatty acyl-coas ceramides and diacylglycerol importantly these molecules were shown to induce lipotoxicity when found in high concentrations and can inflict damage to cells 109it is not well-established whether lipotoxicity is related to genetic or non-genetic causes but it is not considered to be a single-gene disease opinions which argue that obesity can either attenuate or facilitate lipotoxicity exist indisputably a high-fat diet increases the risk for this pathological condition importantly individuals with high number of lipotoxic cells appear to be resistant to both insulin and leptin 110initially the term oxidative stress was defined as the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the former 111 over the years this definition is based on new data and oxidative stress is now considered a disorder of the redox signaling 112lipid peroxidation is caused by hydroxyl radical oh derived from elevated superoxide anion levels 2 fig 3 in turn hydroxyl radical causes the formation of looh finally a variety of reactive lipid aldehydes rla such as malondialdehyde mda and 4-hydroxynonenal 4-hne are created with the ability to modify proteins through protein carbonylation 113114 normally phase i and phase ii enzymes would detoxify rla products but in individuals exhibiting metabolic syndrome rlas accumulate causing damage to cells and their membranes these alterations have been associated with inflammation and various pathologies including obesity neurodegenerative disease asthma cardiovascular desease cvd type ii diabetes and cancer 115124oxidative stress as mentioned above leads to increased free fatty acids concentration in -type pancreatic cells enhanced insulin secretion type ii diabetes and cell death through the exit of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of caspase 3 113 one strategy for protection against these detrimental effects has been proposed in a study by zhu et al 125 in which the effects of perilipin 5 were examined perilipin 5 activates the pi3kakt path as well as erk signaling which activates nrf2-type pancreatic cells subsequently nrf2 enters the nucleus and as a transcriptional factor activates the antioxidant response element are that enhances the transcription of down-stream antioxidant enzymes as a result -type pancreatic cells exhibit increased glutathione levels and decreased reactive oxygen species levels the above signaling pathway thus enhances -type pancreatic cell protection defends them from apoptosis and facilitates the execution of the normal function of these cellsobesity has been linked to increased susceptibility to infections 126 in addition a very important field of research suggests that various types of viruses utilize fatty tissue as a reservoir including adenovirus ad-36 influenza a virus as well as hiv 127 in this sense the covid-19 tissue and cellular localization may be correlated to fatty tissue 128 the association of obesity with elevated mortality rates compared to non-obese people who have a common virus h1n1 has been reported 129133 another study in 30 people with covid-19 showed that patients with bmi 27025 exhibit the disease with more severe symptoms as compared to patients with bmi 22013 134 finally an analysis of bmi correlation in cohort of covid-19 patients showed that non-survivors who were 1518 of the total participants in the respective study had bmi 25 at a rate of 882 on the contrary only 189 of survivors had bmi 25 135clinical reports of patients infected with sars-cov-2 show that several parameters associated with infection as well as the severity of the disease ie older age hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease are correlated to viral invasion induced ace2 down-regulation importantly angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 receptors mediate the entry of sars-cov nl63 and sars-cov-2 into the cell 136 particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages as well as angiotensin ii degradation to angiotensin 17 via the aceangiotensin iiangiotensin ii receptor type 1 or at1 receptor axis 137 structural allelic or genetic variations in the sars-cov-2 spike protein and genetic or allelic variations of the host receptor ace2 including rs73635825 s19p and rs143936283 e329g lead to the cross-species transmission of the virus the specific modifications have been found to significantly contribute to the susceptibility andor resistance against the viral infection 138 thus the resulting ace2 deficiency upon viral invasion may enhance the dys-regulation between the adverse aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis and the protective ace2angiotensin 17mas receptor signaling in the lungs decreased angiotensin 17 and g-protein coupled mas receptor binding enhances the severity of vasoconstriction fibrosis inflammation thrombosis and pulmonary damage including edema and permeability triggered by local angiotensin ii hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin 17 139although the association between obesity and heart disease is well-established underlying pathophysiological processes remain elusive and it is unclear whether cardiomyopathy in obese patients is due to increased deposition of adipose tissue itself or due to the effects of obesity-associated comorbidities including hypertension metabolic syndrome and diabetes in obesity the heart undergoes structural remodeling and functional alterations leading to obesity-associated cardiomyopathy due to interstitial fibrosis cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac steatosis 140 oxidative stress natriuretic peptides endothelin-1 advanced glycation end products induction of tgf increased mean arterial pressure in elderly through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas 141 rho-kinase signaling leptin-mediated actions up-regulation of matricellular proteins such as thrombospondin 1 are molecular mechanisms associated with these processes especially in obese adults 142 furthermore the sleep apneaobesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as respective coexisting neurohormonal and metabolic alterations diabetes 143 insulin resistance and long-term inflammatory adipocyte-derived factors directly influence the pro-inflammatory signaling in the heart 144the above data are very important as it seems that lipotoxicity and obesity are directly related to viral infections as well as to the challenges in combating this infection as shown by the increased need of severely obese patients for ventilator support the fact that in the western world general population exhibits much higher rates of obesity argues that these countries need to be prepared as regarding intensive care units icu and ventilator devices finally it is important for obese individuals to take all the preventive actions proposed by the who to minimize the chances of becoming infected with covid-19 145146it is important to note that raas and ace2 are expressed in adipose tissue and that angiotensin ii can be released from fat tissue during periods of increased sympathetic nervous system activity with complex interactions linking central raas with adipose tissue raas 147covid-19 however seems to challenge the obesity paradox 148 as in various pathologies connected with high levels of inflammation including heart failure kidney failure and ards being obese seems to offer a dose of protection and moderate obese patients tend to present lower mortality indeed in mechanically ventilated adults with acute lung injury obrien et al 149 in a retrospective study in 1488 patients determined that patients with lower body mass index bmi were associated with higher mortality as compared to obese patients in the case of ards it was hypothesized that clinicians tended to admit more readily obese patients to icu regarding them as more vulnerable and needing extra care 150 the said obesity paradox was also found to exist for patients with pneumonia according to a meta-analysis of ten cohort studies on mortality 151152 mechanistically other researchers have expressed the opinion that obesity induces a type of preconditioning to inflammatory cues constituting obese patients more resistant to the high influx of inflammatory cytokines under ards or heart failure conditionsindeed it has been suggested in cardiovascular disease patients that the aforesaid obese may reflect the biological properties of adipose tissue 153 indeed not all obese people present inflammation thus the terms of metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity are used with metabolically unhealthy obesity being linked to increased visceralabdominal fat 76obesity was rarely mentioned in early clinical reports evaluating the clinical risk factors for sars-cov-2 infection novel data from a single center retrospective study confirm that obesity had a high frequency among patients admitted in intensive care for sars-cov-2 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and that disease severity increased with bmi 154 indeed a very recent report on a large sample of patients younger than 60 years tested positive for covid-19 correlated higher bmis values with increased probability for admission to critical care 155importantly overweight pre-pregnancy obese and obese pregnant women are at increased risk for both morbidity and mortality from cmv 156 including all recorded influenza pandemics 1918 157 1957 158 and 2009 159 varicella zoster 160 listeria monocytogenes 161 malaria 162 as well as sars 163 moreover the highest mortality risk for these pregnant women was correlated to acute cardiopulmonary conditions presenting in the second and third trimesters 164 furthermore the above mentioned pathological conditions were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth and fetal death 165maternal burden of coronavirus infection may have significant implications for neonatal immune ontogeny as high maternal viremia has been associated with significantly lower cd4 t-cell count in uninfected progeny increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by placental cells can negatively affect infant innate cytokine responses in early life pregnancy outcomes and facilitate mother-to-child transmission of coronavirus in the infant indeed increased placenta leptin production affects uterine contractility playing a role in the dysfunctional labor process associated with maternal obesity and the resultant high cesarean section rates 166pregnancy immune phenotype may be correlated with the sars-cov-2 prevalence in pregnant women both xenobiotics and enveloped viruses such as sars-cov-2 induce immune-suppression 167 characterized by significant increases in blood phagocytes placental dcs and immature monocyte-derived dcs decreases in the number and activity of nk and t cells 168 and inhibition of th1 responses from maternal-fetal th2 cytokine cocktail especially il-1il-6tnf- -defensins 169 shifting toward th2 immunity 170 inefficacy of adaptiveinflammatory immunity in the later stages of pregnancy as well as membrane permeabilization to sars-cov-2 entry 171obesity is a medical condition with complex pathophysiology comprising various mechanisms which now emerges as a significant risk factor for covid-19 targeted epidemiological studies specifically oriented in order to reveal the impact of obesity in covid-19 severity and mortality rates are needed in order to determine specific therapeutic strategies for obese patientsduring the viral infection host factors trigger an immune response to be against the virus that could result in pulmonary tissue damage functional impairment and reduced lung capacity if the immune pathogenesis associated with an immune response is out of control
5
 in the immune response macrophages present sarscov2 antigens to t cells that activate differentiate and release chemokines and cytokines such as interleukin il1 il6 il8 il21 tumor necrosis factor tnf and monocyte chemotactic protein mcp1 causing the cs that recruits lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection whether it is in an infected cell or in an immune cell nuclear factor kappa b nfb activation itself may play an important role in immune response and acute inflammatory lung injury figure 1

6

growing evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe covid19 might have a cs syndrome with systemic inflammation multiple organ failure and high inflammatory parameters
7
 cs has been previously documented in patients with coronavirus pneumonia infection that is sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers accompanied by rapid viral replication and inflammatory cell infiltration leading to ali and death
8
 
9
 in a recent clinical trial in 41 covid19 infected patients in wuhan huang et al
10
 documented high amounts of il1 interferon ifn ifninducible protein and mcp1 probably leading to activated thelper1 cell responses moreover the same authors documented higher concentrations of granulocyte colonystimulating factor ifninducible protein mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and tnf in intensive care unit hospitalized sarscov2infected patients than did those not requiring intensive care unit admission suggesting that cs was associated with disease severity
10
 finally several studies documented a significant increase in il6 plasma levels in critically ill patients with covid19
11
 
12
 
13
 
14
 this increase in cs is associated with ali during covid19 infection and it is characterized by an in intraalveolar fibrin accumulation that stimulates the production of both profibrotic growth factors
15
 and profibrotic cytokine transcripts such as transforming growth factor connective tissue growth factor and plateletderived growth factor with a decrease in pulmonary surfactant protein leading to collapse or closure of alveoli and loss of lung compliance changes in lung volumes
16
 in combination a highfibrinlowsurfactant intraalveolar environment provides an ideal environment for fibroblast adherence and growth resulting in collagen deposition and development of lung fibrosis
17
 finally fibrin and fibrin breakdown products increase vascular permeability stimulate migration and proliferation of inflammatory cells and promote recruitment of neutrophils to the lung
18
 
19
 taken together these factors decrease the capacity to cleave and remove fibrin deposits corresponding with a poor clinical patient outcome
20
 moreover the increased release of proinflammatory factors il1 il6 il8 il21 tnf and mcp1 etc is associated with hypercoagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation that could induce an impairment in clinical conditions additionally the subgroup of patients having immunosuppression could improve mortality therefore it is of great significance to pay attention to sepsis immunosuppression caused by covid19
21
 
22
 
23

tian et al
24
 described 2 patients who underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma pt1bn0 and were later found to have been infected with sarscov2 pathological findings from these 2 patients are edema and prominent proteinaceous exudates vascular congestion and inflammatory clusters with fibrinoid material and multinucleated giant cells
24
 liu et al
25
 and xu et al
26
 found that the pathological features of covid19 resemble those exhibited in mers and sars in particular during the autopsy of a covid19 cadaver liu et al
25
 documented in right pleura the presence of an intense inflammation with edema and fiber bands similarly histologic examination performed by xu et al
26
 showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates using minimally invasive autopsies in 3 patients died from covid19 pneumonia yao et al
27
 described alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation all findings above suggest that exudative inflammation occurred in the early to late phase of covid19 pneumonia therefore potent antiinflammatory drugs should be administered for covid19 pneumonia besides antiviral drugsbased on the pathophysiology and pathological changes of lungs in patients with covid19 it may be better for them if antiviral and antiinflammatory drugs are administered early in the late stage uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation caused by sarscov2 infection will lead to cs immunosuppression and ards and it may be difficult to attenuate the severe ali with any managementto date there is not a specific treatment for covid19
28
 
29
 even if some clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate their effects as addon therapy in covid19 patients drugs possibly effective for covid19 are reported in table 1 lopinavirritonavir and addon ifn1b has been studied for mers treatment
30
 
31
 and in recent clinical trials it has been also proposed for covid19 treatment
14
 
32
 however cao et al
33
 in a randomized controlled openlabel trial in 199 hospitalized adult patients with covid19 documented that the lopinavirritonavir combination 400 mg and 100 mg respectively twice daily for 14 days was not associated with clinical improvement compared with standard care procedures in a recent retrospective cohort study in covid19 patients deng et al
34
 documented that a 14day treatment with lopinavirumifenovir also called arbidol induced a significant improvement p  05 of clinical symptoms and laboratory finding virus detection compared to lopinavir alone favipiravir a purine nucleic acid analog table 1 approved for use in influenza is studied in the management of covid19
35
 in particular to date april 14 2020 9 clinical trials have been recorded in the world health organization database 7 favipiravir alone jprnjrcts041190120 jprnjrcts031190226 chictr2000030254 chictr2000030113 chictr2000029600 chictr2000029548 chictr2000029544 1 plus chloroquine phosphate chictr2000030987 and 1 plus tocilizumab chictr2000030894wang et al
36
 suggest that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine used in the prevention and treatment of malaria
37
 could play a role in the management of covid19 due to their mechanism of action table 1
38
 
39
 
40
 however the problem of chloroquine is its safety related to the dosage in fact as suggested by duan et al
41
 the dosage for covid19 treatment is 500  mg twice daily for no more than 10 days which is larger than of the dosage for previous treatment of malaria so it is very important to evaluate the development of adverse reactions in a small group of patients with covid19 n  20 guatret et al
42
 demonstrated a significant viral load decrease 3 days after the beginning of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin treatment respect to the control group 571 and 125 respectively however the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin for covid19 infection is only supported by in vitro data and weak studies and physicians should consider the development of adverse effects to determine their benefit if any in treating or preventing covid19
43

remdesivir is a monophosphate prodrug that undergoes metabolism to an active cadenosine nucleoside triphosphate analogue currently remdesivir is a promising potential therapy for covid19 due to its broadspectrum potent in vitro activity against several novel coronaviruses including sarscov2 with half maximal effective concentration and concentration for 90 of maximal effect ec90 values of 077 m and 176 m respectively clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of remdesivir in patients with mild to moderate or severe covid19
3
 notably williamson et al
44
 recently used the rhesus macaque model of sarscov2 infection to investigate the antiviral activity of remdesivir therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in sarscov2infected rhesus macaques these data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in covid19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia
44

moreover recently chen et al
45
 reported that the viral genome of covid19 encodes 20 proteins among these two proteases plpro and 3clpro are vital to virus replication and they suggested that sofosbuvir in the fixed combination with velpatasvir or ledipasvir could be effective in the treatment of covid19 owing to their dual inhibitory actions on 2 viral enzymes other antiviral drugs umifenovir oseltamivir and ribavirin currently are also being tested in ongoing randomized trials
3

in this concern several drugs could be used as addon therapy to inhibit lung inflammation and reduce cs azithromycin commonly used to treat bacterial infections could be used as addon antiviral therapy in patients with sarscov2 infection
28
 due to its immunomodulant effect
46
 in fact to date april 14 2020 there are 21 clinical trials recorded on clinicaltrialgov that evaluate the effect of azithromycin addon to hydroxychloroquine sulfate or tocilizumab in the treatment of hospitalized patients with moderate or severe covid19 one prospective trial that is in recruiting in utah nct04334382 evaluates the effect of oral azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg on days 25 vs oral hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1 then 200 mg twice daily on days 24 in outpatients 45 years old with covid19 recently it has been reported that tocilizumab recombinant human il6 monoclonal antibody used for rheumatic diseases to block il6 signaling and its mediated inflammatory response is approved to treat the cytokine release syndrome caused by chimeric antigen receptor tcell immunotherapy
47
 
48
 until now april 14 2020 several clinical trials have been registered on safety and efficacy of tocilizumab 8 mgkg intravenously single infusion up to a maximum of 800 mgdose alone or with other drugs in the treatment of severe covid19 pneumonia in both china registry chictr2000029765 chictr2000030796 chictr2000030442 and chictr2000030894 and clinicaltrialgov registry 16 trials up to april 14 2020 concerning the similar mechanism of action other monoclonal antibodies or smallmolecule inhibitors are under investigation to evaluate their efficacy and safety in covid19 table 2sarscov2 is able to invade and enter cells using angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor through endocytosis which is regulated by adaptorassociated protein kinase 1 angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor is a cellsurface protein widely existed on cells in the heart kidney blood vessels especially lung alveolar epithelium type 2 cells
49
 
50
 
51
 considering this mechanism drugs able to block adaptorassociated protein kinase 1 eg sarilumab and baricitinib can interrupt both the passage of the virus into cells and the cytokine storm and could be used in covid19 treatment
52

metronidazole decreasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines ie il1 and  il6 il8 il12 ifn tnf as well as the levels of creactive protein and neutrophil count could be efficacious in the management of immunopathological manifestations of the covid19
53
 however clinical studies must be performed to further validate this experimental observationconcerning the role of corticosteroids as addon therapy in covid19 patients even if they have antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory activity
54
 
55
 
56
 to date there is no evidence concerning their efficacy to improve the clinical outcomes in these patients
57
 
58
 moreover corticosteroids can delay the viral clearance
59
 
60
 
61
 therefore arabi et al
61
 advise against their continuous use in sarscov2infected patients in addition in the late stage of covid19 immunosuppression can often be seen in patients therefore the use of corticosteroids may aggravate this condition in patients with covid19
4
 in agreement with these data the guideline of the world health organization
62
 does not suggest the use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia and ards for suspected covid19 casesfinally some natural products and traditional medicines are investigated to treat patients with covid19 lianhuaqingwen capsule a traditional chinese medicine formula has been used to treat influenza and exerted broadspectrum antiviral effects on a series of influenza viruses and immune regulatory effects
63
 recently lianhuaqingwen capsule has been registered in clinical center of china chictr2000029434 chictr2000029433 to treat patients with covid19 pneumonia table 1 and was finally approved approval no 2020b02813 by the national medical products administration of china for the treatment of mild and moderate coronavirus pneumonia on april 12 2020escin represents some isomers of escin saponins or the natural mixture of triterpene saponins in different production extracted from seeds of aesculus hippocastanum l aesculus wilsonii rehd and others in china sodium aescinate injection consists of a b c and d escin of which a and b are the main components that belong to escin figure 2 accumulating evidence suggests that escin exerts potent antiinflammatory antiedematous effects and has been used to treat acute edema in clinic recently the sodium of escin sodium aescinate injection was registered in the clinical center of china chictr2000029742 and italy nct04322344 to treat patients with covid19 pneumoniaxin et al
64
 reported that 10 gml of escin significantly inhibits the secretion of inflammatory factors including nitric oxide no tnf and il1 in lipopolysaccharide lpsstimulated raw2647 macrophage cells furthermore the combination of suboptimal concentrations of 01 gml of escin with 1 ngml of corticosterone which alone could not depress the release of inflammatory factors inhibited the secretion of no tnf and il1 in vitro these findings suggest that escin can synergize with glucocorticoids to enhance their antiinflammatory effect in human endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions escin 3 m inhibits the inflammation blocking nuclear translocation of p50 and p65
65
 montopoli et al
66
 reported that escin shows dosedependent 011 m effects in lpsactivated endothelial cells reducing il6 release and vascular cell adhesion molecule1 activity in another experimental study in human endothelial cells chen et al67 documented that escin 10 gml inhibits the overexpression of the aquaporin1 and alleviates barrier dysfunction induced by proinflammatory high mobility group protein 1escin shows antiviral activities against sarscov respiratory syncytial virus rsv and some other viruses table 3 in sarscovinfected vero e6 cells the half maximal effective concentration for escin against sarscov was 6 m
68
 rsv infection is the leading cause of acute respiratory tract infections in childhood in rsvinfected epithelial and macrophage cell lines 5 gml of escin and 25 gml of aesculus hippocastanum seed extract show significant virucidal and antiviral activities against rsv by modulating activities of nfb activator protein1 and cytokine
69
 in addition herpes simplex virus1 vesicular stomatitis virus and dengue virus are also inhibited by escin and seed extract in vitro in agreement michelini et al
70
 reported that both escin and seed extract decrease levels of tnf and il6 in j774a1 cells infected with hsv1 or stimulated with tolllike receptor ligands probably through the inhibition of nfb and activator protein1 signaling pathways these results support the use of escin in covid19 pneumonia because escin has potent antiinflammatory activities by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines such as il6 tnf and il1 and shows antiviral activity on sarscov rsv dengue virus and othersseveral authors described the effects of escin on ali in animal models in particular wang et al
71
 reported that escin reduces the degree of lung injury and improves function of gas exchange in lpsinduced lung inflammation in mice by inhibiting both the lipid peroxidation and the expression of proinflammatory factors for example no tnf il1 and il6 further xin et al
72
 described that escin could increase glucocorticoid receptor in the lung of animals especially reversing the decrease of glucocorticoid receptor resulting from lps supporting the idea that the antiinflammatory effect of escin could involve the upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor with an increase of endogenous antioxidant activity in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia a 4day administration of escin 18 mgkg intravenously significantly reduced lung inflammation suggesting a role for escin as addon treatment
73
 
74

finally several authors reported that escin is able to attenuate nonpathogenic lung injury in rats with ali induced by phosgene psg which is used extensively in industry escin injection decreased the mortality of animals
74
 in an experimental model of ali induced by oleic acid injection 01 mlkg intravenously wei et al
75
 documented that both pretreatment 1 mgkg and treatment 16 mgkg with sodium aescinate reduces oleic acidinduced ali by modulating the levels of superoxide dismutase malondialdehyde and matrix metallopeptidase 9 in plasma and lung tissue these results have been confirmed by huang et al
76
 experimental models of oleic acidinduced pulmonary fibrosis showed that sodium aescinate improves lung fibrosis by inhibiting the levels of proinflammatory factors such as il1 tnf and transforming growth factor1the clinical efficacy of escin administered for 6 to 20 days on respiratory diseases has been reported table 4 xiao
77
 documented that the injection of sodium aescinate in sarsinfected patients has antiinflammatory and antiexudative effects and reduces the adverse drug reaction related to glucocorticoid administration other authors reported the effects of escin on acute pulmonary edema in patients with thoracic trauma
78
 
79
 
80
 radiation pneumonitis
81
 thoracotomy
82
 and pneumonia
83
 finally escin improves pulmonary function in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic pulmonary heart disease through the inhibition of cytokine release
84
 
85
 
86
 
87

it is well known that sarscov and sarscov2 share very similar gene structure and clinical symptoms rsvinduced pneumonia and covid19 pneumonia have some similar pathological changes for example they all have alveolar inflammatory exudation inflammatory cell infiltration and the formation of hyaline membrane dengue virus also shares some characteristics with covid19 such as sudden onset of high fever and lymphocytopenia the dosage of escin in clinic that is sodium aescinate injection is until 20 mgday the blood concentration in vivo is estimated to reach the similar level as that in vitro the characteristic of escin to inhibit the acute inflammation is similar to dexamethasone or methylprednisolone
74
 
88
 psg has been a chemical warfare agent and can result in severe acute lung injury in ali induced by psg after latent stage of exposure the burst inflammatory response is very similar to the cytokine storm in the late stage of covid19 proinflammatory cytokines tnfa il6 and il8 are critical factors and their concentrations are known to be altered in the process of ali tnfa il6 il8 il4 and il10 levels were significantly increased in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of psgexposed rats however escin injection still could significantly decrease the mortality of rats resulting from phosgene
89
 
90
 escin has shown that it could both attenuate ali and inhibit the secretion of cytokines in animals and humansescin is a traditional medicine that displays antiinflammatory antiedematous and antioxidant properties and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of traumatic edema hemorrhoids and chronic venous insufficiency
91
 without showing severe adverse reactions besides a few gastroenterological reactions for oral tablets and local reaction with injectiontaking the effects of escin in vitro and in vivo the pathophysiology and the inflammatory response in covid19 into account it can be deduced that escin may have a potential role to treat patients with covid19 effectively and it may be predicted that effective antiviral drugs such as remdesivir in combination with potent antiinflammatory drugs such as escin could have a possible therapeutic effects on the severe ali of patients with covid19in china a randomized parallel controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of sodium aescinate injection in the treatment of patients with covid19 pneumonia is being conducted the aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium aescinate for injection compared with conventional treatment in patients with covid19 and to compare the efficacy of conventional therapy plus sodium aescinate for injection and conventional therapy plus glucocorticoids chest imaging computed tomography creactive protein and il6 plasma levels are used to evaluate the efficacy for patients with covid19 in an italian clinical trial escin is administered to covid19 patients as an oral formulation 40 mg 3 times daily or injection 20 mg intravenously once daily for 12 days compared with standard treatment generally a randomized doubleblind and parallel controlled trial is requested to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment and should be performed to reach scientific conclusion even if the treatment of patients with covid19 pneumonia is urgent thus the clinical trials in the future for covid19 pneumonia need to be intensively designedthe authors declare no conflicts of interestsars-cov-2 infects epithelial lung cells via specific interactions with the
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace210 while efforts
are being made worldwide to better understand the cytokine storm that
characterizes the progression to severe pneumonia or ards previous
information from sars-cov and mers-cov infections shown in figure 1 indicates the main
factors1113 it is known that the virus replicates very quickly
in the early stages of infection this means that high levels of viral
proteins known to antagonize interferon ifn responses are generated which
results in a strong yet delayed proinflammatory response at the site of
infection these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines attract
macrophages and neutrophils that also release pro-inflammatory agents this
amplifies the inflammation giving rise to ards sepsis or multiorgan
dysfunction syndrome mods all of which are associated with poor
outcomes14 a comprehensive review of the cytokines
and chemokines involved in the covid-19 cytokine storm is already available
although studies performed in large cohorts of patients have not been
performed12 these are required in order to
determine cutoff values for diagnosis and prognosis purposespro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-8 and tumor necrosis factor
alpha tnf- have been found elevated in the sera of severely and
critically ill covid-19 patients1524
this indicates that these cytokines could be good prognosis biomarkers that
is they could indicate the progression to severe or critical covid-19 many
recent cytokine profiling studies however have only been performed in
small populations and therefore cannot be broadly
generalized1722 larger studies are required to
establish cutoff values as well as to determine the intricate relationships
between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in covid-19 progression based on
other hyperinflammatory syndromes such as sepsis the levels of these
biomarkers will likely fluctuate rapidly this means that patients with
inflammation biomarkers below a certain threshold value may evolve quickly
and require anti-inflammatory treatments even though their initial biomarker
measurements indicated otherwise a solution to this problem could be to
perform periodic measurements of biomarkers in order to evaluate their
kinetics23 this would require biosensors that are
inexpensive and easy to use at the point of care in order to not overburden
healthcare workers it should also be noted that although cytokines are
also present in saliva urine and sputum24 no
information is currently available about their function and usefulness as
biomarkers for cytokine storm monitoring in covid-19 measuring cytokines in
sputum could be particularly valuable because it would reveal information
about local inflammation however only 3040 of covid-19 patients
produce sputum16anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 have also been found in the sera of
covid-19 patients2225 it
is known from other hyperinflammatory syndromes that dysregulated
inflammation is often followed by immune suppression26
putting these patients at high risk of opportunistic infections from
bacteria fungi or even latent viruses such as human cytomegalovirus
cmv2729 this is particularly problematic in the context of
the icu since nosocomial infections by multiresistant pathogens can be
lethal if not promptly detected because of this we anticipate that
biosensors aimed at detecting coinfections will also be required in order to
manage critical covid-19 patients for example biosensors that detect
procalcitonin pct could be useful to detect opportunistic bacterial
infections3032 procalcitonin is produced in parenchymal cells in
response to bacterial toxins in healthy individuals pct is considered
undetectable below 005 ng ml1 pct levels above
12 ng ml1 are usually considered as a warning of
potential bacterial sepsis33 since pct levels do not
rise to such a large extent in viral infections biosensors for this
biomarker could indicate the onset of bacterial infections in covid-19
patientstable 1 summarizes some
anti-inflammatory treatments proposed so far for ameliorating the cytokine
storm in covid-19 patients it should be noted that the evidence supporting
these treatments is weak in other words randomized clinical trials for
these drugs in the context of covid-19 care have not yet been completed
their use is not recommended in official protocols by who only for clinical
trials or compassionate motives many are repurposed drugs already in use
for other diseases and syndromes but not for infections34 it is important to highlight this as many of these pharmaceuticals are
immunosuppressive since covid-19 patients are already immunosuppressed due
to ifn attenuation and anti-inflammatory responses the administration of
these immunomodulators may exacerbate the risk of an opportunistic infection
or reduce the effect of antiviral drugsa good example of the polemic surrounding these anti-inflammatory treatments is
the use of corticosteroids corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are
inexpensive and globally available they are not routinely recommended for
sepsis care except in cases of septic shock previous evidence from
sars-cov-1 and mers patients treated with corticosteroids yielded widely
disparate outcomes11 and the who and idsa have
discouraged the use of corticosteroids for covid-19 care nevertheless
several authors report good outcomes when administering these drugs at
cautious doses83536 of those reporting good
outcomes dosing and timing have been highlighted as the key factors for
successful corticosteroid therapy in the context of sars-cov infections
kinetic profiles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 could provide
crucial data to guide the onset of corticosteroid treatment and adjust doses
in order to reduce inflammation while minimizing side effects37 other nonspecific anti-inflammatory treatments that
could benefit from biosensor-guided administration are
hydroxychloroquine7 immunoglobulins
azithromycin38 and convalescent plasma
therapies39drugs based on monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins such as
tocilizumab40 or anakinra41 have
also been proposed for reducing hyperinflammation caused by covid-19 these
treatments block specific pro-inflammatory signal pathways these drugs
could benefit from a companion diagnostics approach similar
to that which is used in cancer care that is the administration of these
drugs would be guided by measurements of the specific pro-inflammatory
factors they modulate for example tocilizumab binds receptors of il-6
both soluble and membrane-bound this blocks the interaction with
membrane-bound gp130 which in turn prevents the activation of a downstream
janus kinase responsible for signal cascading42 it has
been proposed that blockers of the il6-mediated inflammatory response such
as tocilizumab and sarilumab should be guided by il-6 measurements with a
threshold value around 20 pg ml14344 these
antibodies have proven to be useful to treat unwanted cytokine release
syndromes in immune anticancer therapies some early reports on the benefits
of using tocilizumab are encouraging although a clinical trial for
sarilumab has recently been discontinued due to a lack of clear positive
outcomes interestingly serial il-6 measurements have shown that after the
administration of tocilizumab there is a slight increase in il-6 followed by
sharp decrease over time43 these early reports highlight
the relevance of performing kinetic measurements of biomarkers for
monitoring the progress of inflammatory diseasestable s1 summarizes the main features of recent biosensor
prototypes for cytokine detection as highlighted above time-dependent pro-
and anti-inflammatory responses are involved in covid-19 progression a
multisensor system capable of detecting several of these biomarkers
simultaneously would provide evidence to determine disease stage and guide
personalized therapies for example it has been reported that plasmonic
nanosensor arrays can detect 6 cytokines simultaneously il-2 il-6 il-4
il-10 ifn- and tnf- figure 2a45 these multisensors
require a minute sample size 1 l and show an impressive dynamic
range for quantification between 10 and 10 000 pg ml1
the signal transduction mechanism consists of measuring changes in the
localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of gold nanorods with dark-field
microscopy this provides information about cytokine binding to antibodies
in real time which is more informative than traditional end-point elisa
the total time required to run the whole chip is only 40 min the rapid
analysis time makes this detection platform suitable for aiding clinical
decision-making in emergency situations another interesting multisensor
platform using electrochemical transducers is shown in figure 2b it contains 32 individually
addressable electrodes each one multiplexed with an 8-port manifold to
provide 256 measurements in less than 1 h46 however it
also requires an off-line protein capture step on magnetic nanobeads
electrochemical immunoassays for il-6 with these devices reported a wide
dynamic range between 01 and 104 pg ml1
multiplexed cytokine measurements with electrochemical biosensors have also
been reported using graphene oxide to fabricate nanoprobes47 this platform detects il-6 il-1 and tnf-
spiked into the same mouse serum sample the multiplexed detection was
achieved by using antibodies bound to three different signal reporters nile
blue nb methyl blue mb and ferrocene fccovid-19 is a global challenge and requires technologies that are easy to
implement in many different scenarios the oversaturation of hospitals
during the peak of the infection has forced some governments to decentralize
covid-19 care and manage patients in temporary field hospitals and in-home
quarantine in these scenarios detection systems that are not bound by
centralized infrastructure play a key role for instance a lateral flow
immunoassay has been proposed for detecting il-6 in unprocessed blood with
high sensitivity48 the ability to detect cytokines
directly from blood is extremely useful in decentralized healthcare
scenarios since purifying serum or plasma requires a centrifugation step
that is difficult to perform at the bedside however blood contains cells
like erythrocytes which can interfere with colorimetric detection schemes
the lateral flow test used antibody-decorated nanoparticles as probes and
surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy sers as the signal transduction
mechanism it showed a limit of detection of 5 pg ml1 in
whole blood this limit of detection however was achieved with a dxr raman
microscope which is not suitable for point-of-care use over the past
decade a growing trend in biosensors has been to interface them with mobile
devices such as smartphones4951 this is an appealing option because
smartphones already have a high global market penetration and therefore do
not require the purchase of additional readers mobile biosensors for il-6
have been recently proposed52 the devices consist of a
paper immunosensor for colorimetric detection using gold nanoprobes figure 2c the gold nanoprobes
generate colored spots that are detected in real time with a smartphone app
instead of external attachments the app uses an augmented reality system in
order to control photographic conditions this system also compensates for
variable light conditions allowing the user to quantify colorimetric
signals using only an unmodified smartphone the biosensor was able to
detect variations in il-6 levels as small as 125 pg ml1
in whole blood and with a rapid assay time of only 18 min furthermore the
paper substrate makes it particularly useful for monitoring infectious
diseases because it can be easily disposed of by incinerationbiosensors capable of continuously monitoring cytokine levels would be ideal
for detecting covid-19 patients progressing to severe or critical stages as
well as to check the success of anti-inflammatory therapies while to the
best of our knowledge immunosensors for continuous detection of biomarkers
in blood have not yet been proposed some prototypes with the potential to
achieve this feature can be found in the recent literature for example
needle-shaped microelectrodes have been proposed for detecting alterations
in il-6 levels in real time figure 3a53 in this design the interaction
between the cytokine and antibodies bound to the electrode changes the
impedance of the system without the need for detection antibodies or labels
the authors suggest that integrating the sensors with a cannula within the
bloodstream could enable the real-time monitoring of il-6 levels although
the initial prototype was only tested in surrogate serum samples recently
an electrochemical biosensor capable of continuous monitoring in blood
samples has been proposed it consists of a wire electrode modified with
aptamers that change their configuration upon binding their target figure 3b54
this changes the position of a redox active molecule methylene blue with
respect to the electrode which can be followed with square-wave voltammetry
figure 3c the authors
demonstrated that the sensors implanted in a rat could detect vancomycin as
a target molecule in real time figure 3d adapting this technology for detecting cytokines could
enable a precise profiling of the covid-19 inflammation55 finally a wearable detection platform has also been proposed that could
be a game-changer in inflammation monitoring56 it is
based on the intradermal delivery of biocompatible near-infrared nir
quantum dots an array of these nanosensors is delivered using dissolvable
microneedles the fluorescence emission of the quantum dots was fine-tuned
so that they would be invisible to the naked eye but detectable upon
illumination with nir light the pattern of emitted light generated by the
array can be detected with a modified smartphone and evaluated with a
machine learning algorithm while this technology has initially been
demonstrated as a way to keep vaccination records adaptation for continuous
monitoring of biomarkers could revolutionize the field of personalized
medicineto date there have been more than 264 000 deaths due to covid-19
worldwide social distancing measures have flattened the virus propagation
curve and many countries are relaxing confinement measures at the same
time there is also a consensus view that the virus will not be eradicated
until a vaccine is developed and deployed until then new tools are
required in order to reduce the burden of covid-19 it is imperative to
avoid the progression from severe pneumonia to critical ards measuring
prognosis biomarkers and combining this knowledge with clinical observations
and risk factors is a winning strategy for stratifying patients according to
disease severity biosensors have the potential to play a central role in
this process by providing rapid information at the point of care they could
also provide guidance for the administration of immunomodulators which can
have deleterious effects if they are not dosed carefullyfor this to happen several translational challenges need to be met from a
technological perspective to ensure rapid measurements at the point of
care devices must be easy to use by a frontline healthcare worker this
means that analytical platforms should enable the detection of cytokines in
one simple step also biosensors need to be inexpensive enough to enable
multiple measurements this is important because inflammatory processes
evolve rapidly and therefore it would be ideal to obtain a personalized
biomarker profile for each patient implanted biosensors could enable a
continuous monitoring of patients however this technology still needs
further development and regulatory aspects for future commercialization will
be much tougher than nonimplanted biosensors multisensors are also seen as
key players in precision medicine for covid-19 because they provide
information about the relative levels of different pro- and
anti-inflammatory processes which is important to design personalized
therapiesall in all we propose that the ideal device for managing the cytokine storm
responsible for severe and critical covid-19 cases should encompass all the
features of current biosensors that is they should monitor the levels of
several cytokines simultaneously in raw blood samples have a rapid
turnaround time be easy to dispose of and use portable readers paper
biosensors can be destroyed by incineration which is important to meet
biosafety regulations readers should also be easily disinfected especially
for decentralized testing wearable biosensors would enable the continuous
monitoring of patients a much-desired feature however the technology
still needs further development to be ready for clinical translation the
information provided by these devices should then be combined with patient
data age comorbidities treatments microbiology results in order to
assess the risk of a poor prognosis using the information from these
biosensors to train a neural network has the potential to achieve this
goalcoronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has rapidly caused a pandemic recent reports showed that individuals with obesity may be more vulnerable to severe complications of covid-19 by virtue of the increased risk of chronic diseases driven by obesity 1 the reasons for this are not well known but chronic inflammation is suspected to be one of the causes obesity is a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation which is characterized by increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion from adipose tissue and the infiltration of leukocytes including macrophages into the adipose tissue thus this chronic inflammation impairs insulin signaling in adipocytes causing insulin resistance and contributing to the development of metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and hypertension 2 which are well known comorbidities that adversely affect the outcome of patients with covid-19in addition patients with severe covid-19 commonly show cytokine storms which refer to an excessive and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-6 il-6 in particular serum il-6 levels in those with severe covid-19 were significantly higher than in those with mild cases 1 3 although most people with covid-19 develop no symptoms or have only mild illness the evidence shows that about 14 of covid-19 patients develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and oxygen support while 5 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis septic shock and multiorgan failure 4 5 and these are all related to inflammatory responsesindividuals living with obesity have chronically higher leptin and lower adiponectin concentrations this unfavorable hormone status leads to a dysregulation of the immune response and can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-related complications 6 in the basal state individuals with obesity have a higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines under viral infection obesity-related chronic inflammation causes reduced macrophage activation and blunts proinflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation 7 the reduced macrophage activation by viral infection may explain the poor vaccination response in obese patients moreover b- and t-cell responses are impaired in individuals with obesity with numerical and functional alterations of lymphocytes and these alterations may increase susceptibility to viral infection thus this dysregulated proinflammatory response contributes to the severe lung lesions seen during the covid-19 pandemic 6 based on this mechanism individuals with obesity who already have low-level chronic inflammation may be more vulnerable to cytokine storms by covid-19 infectionto curb these cytokine storms in covid-19 patients anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial however the use of anti-inflammatory treatments can be a double-edged sword anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection especially in those with impaired immune systems some proinflammatory cytokine antagonists for example il-6 antagonists can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and thus may eliminate adverse effects of cytokine storms without preventing the effects of other inflammatory cytokines in removing sars-cov-2 from the infected organs a recent study showed that colchicine treatment had a beneficial effect in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome in reducing il-6 8 which may translate to a beneficial effect in people with obesity and covid-19 infection however anti-inflammatory medications such as janus kinase inhibitors which were recently reported to treat covid-19 patients can inhibit a variety of inflammatory cytokines including interferon- which plays an important role in suppressing virus activity and thus may not be suitable for treatment of inflammatory cytokine storms caused by covid-19 9given the viral nature of cytokine storms and the substantial impairment of immune systems in severe cases it is critical to strike a balance between up- and downregulation of inflammatory markers for immune homeostasis in addition starting anti-inflammatory treatment at the right time is of pivotal importance and should be tailored in individual patients to achieve the most favorable effectsthe combined use of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs may be applied as well as we mentioned above some anti-inflammatory therapies may increase viral replication on the other hand antiviral treatment to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication and block sars-cov-2 infection may induce proinflammatory cytokine production 10 therefore additional large-cohort studies are required to substantiate or dismiss this possibility before applying clinical trialsthere are a few studies suggesting that individuals with obesity may be at higher risk of poor outcomes from covid-19 by hyperinflammation the inflammatory response may be uncontrolled due to malfunctioning or exhausted immune cells such as b and t cells and macrophages in those with obesity and low-level chronic inflammation 7 therefore further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the role of obesity-induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of covid-19 in this context a wide variety of strategies such as increased vigilance early detection and testing and aggressive treatment should be established for patients with obesity and covid-19 infection
