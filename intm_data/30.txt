arguments in favour of remdesivir for treating sars-cov-2 infections wen-chien ko jean-marc rolain nan-yao lee po-lin chen ching-tai huang ping-ing lee po-ren hsueh   since the end of 2019 an increasing number of cases of pneumonia were reported in wuhan followed by other cities and provinces in china and many other countries 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 8 a new human pathogen was identified as the cause of wuhan pneumonia the disease spectrum of sars-cov-2 infection so-called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was known to be diverse in severity ranging from asymptomatic carriage to mild respiratory tract infection and severe or fatal pneumonia moreover sars-cov-2 can be transmitted within the family in the community among cruise passengers and in hospitals and has become a public-health emergency of international concern pheic declared by the world health organization who on 30 january 2020 as of 28 february 2020 laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 have been reported in 56 countries and territories with more than 83 382 cases reported globally more than 78 832 of these cases were reported from china httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus in the view of virologists human and zoonotic coronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales currently there are four genera in the subfamily coronavirinae of the family coronaviridae alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus before the current covid-19 epidemic there were six recognised human respiratory coronaviruses including hcov-229e alphacoronavirus hcov-oc43 betacoronavirus hcov-nl63 alphacoronavirus and hku1 betacoronavirus that often cause mild respiratory tract infection as well as sars-cov and mers-cov that in contrast can lead to severe or even fatal lower respiratory tract disease 9 the seventh human coronavirus sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus which also contains sars-cov and mers-cov so far no drugs monoclonal antibodies or vaccines have been approved to treat human infections due to coronaviruses several pre-existing and potential drug candidates including chloroquine and remdesivir have been considered 10 11 12 the discovery and marketing of new compounds often require months to years however in the face of the global spread of covid-19 effective interventions for severe cases of covid-19 are urgently required although little is known about sars-cov-2 several insights may be gained from its more well-known family member sars-cov 11 here we review the literature on an existing but not approved antiviral agent remdesivir which exhibits promising in vitro antiviral activity and preliminary clinical experiences in the treatment of covid-19 although sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share only 82 rna sequence identity their rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp shares 96 sequence identity 11 therefore drugs targeting viral rdrp proteins of sars-cov are likely to be effective for sars-cov-2 for the rdrp target in the genus betacoronavirus there are several potential drugs or compounds including favipiravir ribavirin penciclovir galidesivir remdesivir 6-fluorinated aristeromycin analogues and acyclovir fleximer analogues 12 remdesivir gs-5734 the phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine cnucleoside 13 has a similar structure to tenofovir alafenamide which is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine 5-monophosphate with antiviral activity against hepatitis b virus and human immunodeficiency virus hiv it was developed by gilead science inc and has not been licensed or approved anywhere so far moreover gs-441524 has been recommended for the treatment of cats with feline infectious peritonitis which is uncommon but fatal and is caused by a feline coronavirus 14 the chemical formula of remdesivir with a molecular mass of 6026 is c27h35n6o8p remdesivir can be effectively metabolised to active nucleoside triphosphate in several human cell lines 15 an in vitro study has demonstrated that nucleoside triphosphate works as an incorporation competitor with adenosine triphosphate confuses viral rdrp acts as a delayed rna chain terminator against ebola virus 1516 evades proofreading by viral exoribonuclease and causes a decrease in viral rna production 17 recently the antiviral activity of remdesivir was demonstrated at the stage after virus entry into vero e6 cells supporting its antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue 18 in 2016 remdesivir gs-5734 was reported to be active against ebola virus in multiple human cell types including primary macrophages and human endothelial cells with low half-maximal effective concentration ec50 values of 006014 m 15 in addition remdesivir was reported to exhibit antiviral activity in vitro against marburg virus 15 paramyxoviridae such as parainfluenza type 3 virus nipah virus hendra virus and measles and mumps viruses and pneumoviridae such as respiratory syncytial virus 19 in primary human airway epithelial cell culture a biologically relevant in vitro model of pulmonary infection remdesivir was shown to inhibit sars-cov half-maximal inhibitory concentration ic50  0069 m and mers-cov ic50  0074 m replication 20 in addition remdesivir was effective against many human and zoonotic coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-229e mouse hepatitis virus mhv betacoronavirus sars-cov and related bat coronaviruses wiv1 and shc014 betacoronavirus mers-cov and related bat coronavirus hku5 and porcine deltacoronavirus deltacoronavirus 172021 a recent study reported the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir against the causative aetiological pathogen of wuhan pneumonia ncov-2019betacovwuhanwiv042019 the ec50 of remdesivir in vero e6 cells was 077 m and the ec90 was 176 m 18 therefore remdesivir is regarded to have broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity even before approval and clinical use the concern of antiviral resistance against remdesivir has been studied using mhv as the tested coronavirus two of three lineages of wild-type mhv in the presence of increased concentrations of gs-441524 were lost after 17 and 20 repeated passages and only one lineage after 23 passages selected a low-level resistant mutant conferring a 56-fold increase in the ec50
17 two amino acid substitutions f467l and v553l were noted in non-structural protein nsp 12 the rdrp of mhv and also resulted in a 6-fold increase in the ec50 in sars-cov however the remdesivir-resistant mhv with f476l and v553l mutations was outcompeted by wild-type mhv in the absence of gs-5734 suggestive of the effect of remdesivir resistance on decreased viral fitness of note in the mouse model of sars-cov infection the remdesivir-resistant sars-cov-infected mice lost less weight and had a more evident decline in pulmonary viral loads by 4 days after infection than wild-type sars-cov-infected mice indicative of attenuated pathogenicity of remdesivir-resistant sars-cov the above findings indicate a high genetic barrier for remdesivir to develop resistance a well as decreased fitness and pathogenicity in remdesivir-resistant mutants and further encourage the therapeutic potential of remdesivir in the treatment of newly emerging covid-19 with the favourable in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir it has been further tested in animal models of different viral infections in a rhesus monkey model of ebola virus disease daily administration of 10 mgkg remdesivir for 12 days profoundly suppressed the replication of ebola virus and protected all infected animals against this lethal infection 15 besides in a mouse model of sars-cov infection prophylactic and early therapeutic dosing of remdesivir effectively decreased the viral load in the lungs and improved pulmonary function 20 according to the previous rhesus monkey model of ebola virus infection an intravenous iv 10 mgkg dose of remdesivir could lead to a lasting level of active triphosphate form in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs 10 m for at least 24 h 15 and such data may be valuable in the same animal species with sars-cov-2 infection although in the animal study the plasma half-life of remdesivir was short 039 h remdesivir was rapidly distributed into pbmcs converted into its active form within 2 h post-infusion and had an intracellular half-life of 14 h in the absence of any human pharmacokinetic information such data from rhesus monkeys indicate that parenteral daily dosing of remdesivir may achieve sustained intracellular concentrations of nucleotide triphosphate which are above its ec90 for sars-cov-2 these in vitro and animal data provide preliminary evidence supporting the clinical potential of remdesivir for human infections caused by contemporary and emerging coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 early clinical experience of remdesivir therapy in a female nurse from scotland with ebola meningoencephalitis which was supported by the detection of ebola virus rna in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid its first use for ebola virus infection in humans was reported in 2016 22 she was successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and 14 days of remdesivir therapy once-daily infusion of 150 mg over 2 h for 2 days and then daily 225 mg for another 12 days no serious clinical or biochemical events occurred except a transient rise of serum amylase level in a recently published randomised controlled clinical trial of four experimental therapeutics for ebola virus disease a total of 175 patients ever received remdesivir 23 although remdesivir therapy was not favoured due to the high mortality rate of 531 93175 no detailed clinical or biochemical side effects associated with remdesivir therapy was ever described the safety profile of remdesivir was not challenged one patient on remdesivir therapy developed hypotension and cardiac arrest after discontinuation of the loading dose however the authors explained that such an adverse event cannot be excluded to be related to underlying ebola virus disease a potentially fatal infectious disease the first case of covid-19 in washington usa was compassionately treated with iv remdesivir for the progression of pneumonia on day 7 of hospitalisation 24 interestingly the patients condition improved and no obvious adverse effects were observed of note real-time reverse transcription pcr testing for sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs remained positive at 4 days after the administration of remdesivir but the authors noted a trend in the decline of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs cycle threshold values illness day 7 the day of remdesivir administration 2324 day 11 3334 and day 12 3740 the oropharyngeal swab tested negative for sars-cov-2 one day later of course it is too early to conclude the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir on enhanced clearing of viral loads in the respiratory tract but it indeed suggests a promising therapeutic effect of remdesivir there are two phase 3 randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trials currently ongoing in china these trials have been submitted to clinicaltrialsgov on 31 january 2020 and are designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of parenteral remdesivir in hospitalised adults with mild-to-moderate and severe covid-19 ie nct04252664 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04252664 and nct04257656 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04257656 respectively the number of cases planned to be enrolled is 308 and 452 respectively a 10-day regimen of remdesivir treatment is as follows 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg once-daily maintenance doses for 9 days in both studies the former regimen of remdesivir therapy was used in the randomised clinical trial of ebola virus disease 23 with an effective reduction of pulmonary viral load in a murine model of sars-cov infection potent antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 acceptable safety profile of parenteral remdesivir therapy in two case reports and a randomised trial of ebola virus disease the clinical use of remdesivir in the cases of covid-19 is are highly anticipated two randomised clinical trials of parenteral remdesivir therapy in the treatment of covid-19 in china may open the window for effective antiviral therapy for such an epidemic infectious disease  the journey of remdesivir from ebola to covid-19 joe pardo ashutosh shukla m gajapathiraju chamarthi asmita gupte   for over two decades global health leaders have been cautioning the world about another pandemic comparable in severity and scope to the 1918 influenza epidemic 1 two major outbreaks afflicted the world in the 20th century that is the 1918 influenza epidemic and the ongoing human immunodeficiency virus hiv pandemic 2 the 21st century has already seen a significant number of outbreaks severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 and the ebola virus ebov in 2014 currently we are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic due to sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 these outbreaks have posed many challenges an important one being the public health aspect but also the lack of effective therapies and vaccines prevention of complications and supportive treatment are the standard of care for most of these recent viral disease outbreaks 3 no treatment has been proven effective for the current covid-19 pandemic the medical community is under immense pressure and many clinicians are embarking on using experimental treatments based on poorly conducted clinical trials and observational data 4 randomized controlled trials conducted efficiently and promptly are the only way to find effective therapies remdesivir gs-5734 is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against ribonucleic acid rna viruses of several families including coronaviridae such as sars-cov mers-cov and strains of bat coronaviruses paramyxoviridae such as nipah virus respiratory syncytial virus and hendra virus and filoviridae such as ebov 59 in this narrative review we will summarize the studies available to date for remdesivir in the context of viral outbreaks especially its development as an antiviral agent for ebola and coronaviruses we searched pubmed for published clinical and preclinical reports assessing remdesivir for ebola virus disease evd sars mers and covid-19 the search terms used were ebola virus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov covid-19 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 and remdesivir or gs-5734 the references of the selected papers were reviewed to identify additional pertinent reports coronaviruses are large enveloped positive-strand rna viruses that can be divided into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus 10 alpha and beta cov are known to cause human disease until recently human coronavirus hcov received relatively less attention as they were considered low-virulence organisms and believed to cause only mild self-limiting upper respiratory infection in humans1112 the first coronavirus outbreak sars caused by sars-cov occurred in the guangdong province of china in 20022003 the mortality rate during this outbreak was 9 with a higher mortality rate 50 in the elderly population this outbreak was largely contained because of relatively inefficient transmission which mainly occurred through direct contact with infected individuals hence strict quarantine of infected patients restricted the spread of the disease and the outbreak ceased after affecting 8098 people and causing death in 774 patients 13 the next coronavirus outbreak occurred in the middle east saudi arabia in 2012 and was named the mers-cov this virus caused severe lower respiratory infection with a mortality rate of about 35 per the world health organizations who report the total number of reported cases globally was 2519 out of which 866 patients died 13 both mers-cov and sars-cov originated from bats however serologic studies for antibody testing in dromedary camels suggested that camels were the intermediate host for mers-cov 14 mers-cov shared many clinical features with sars-cov such as severe atypical pneumonia however there were some differences with mers causing prominent gastrointestinal gi symptoms and acute kidney injury the investigators attributed the differences in clinical manifestations to the involvement of different receptors used by these two viruses while mers binds to the human dipeptidyl peptidase receptor present in the lower airway gi tract and kidney sars binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace-2 receptor1213 the treatments for these coronavirus outbreaks largely relied on supportive care on december 31 2019 china reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology 15 early cases were associated with the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan hubei province soon after that the causative pathogen was identified as a novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease was ultimately named covid-19 sars-cov-2 has high sequence homology with bat coronaviruses 87 identical sequences with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 which supports the hypothesis of bat origin when compared with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has a genetic similarity of 79 and 50 respectively 13 the clinical presentation of covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic carriage to severe viral pneumonia causing acute respiratory distress syndrome fever and gi symptoms are common at the time of this report covid-19 has spread across the globe with 2397216 confirmed cases and 162956 deaths according to the who situation report 16 ebola viruses belong to the family filoviridae a taxonomic group of enveloped non-segmented negative-strand rna viruses there are five different species of ebov that can infect humans but they differ in their virulence and disease progression with a case fatality rate ranging from 40 for bundibugyo ebov to 7090 for zaire ebov humans infected with ebov initially have non-specific symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea with the hemorrhagic phase occurring in half of the cases 17 outbreaks of evd have mainly been limited to africa however in recent times a small number for patients have been transferred to hospitals with modern technology in the usa and germany the mortality rate in africa is often very high compared to patients who have received supportive care in developed countries there are no approved drugs for the treatment of evd during the 20142016 west african outbreak and subsequent outbreak in the democratic republic of congo drc several investigational treatments such as antibody therapy and remdesivir were evaluated in clinical trials 18 in summary it has been challenging to evaluate investigational drugs in randomized controlled trials during outbreak situations the initial response to the covid-19 outbreak was to use treatments that were not shown to be effective in properly conducted trials most studies thus far have lacked adequate controls are observational and have a very small number of patients that precludes any meaningful statistics regarding efficacy here we review the available studies for the antiviral remdesivir gilead sciences inc in an attempt to present an impartial review of data available for this drug with a specific focus on outbreaks of ebov and now sars-cov-2 remdesivir previously gs-5734 chemical formula c27h35n6o8p is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of a c-adenosine nucleoside analogue figure 1 1921 remdesivir terminates viral rna synthesis by inhibiting viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp the active form remdesivir triphosphate competes with native adenosine triphosphate for chain inclusion resulting in delayed chain termination 22 remdesivir displays linear pharmacokinetics and a prolonged intracellular half-life 35 hours for the active parent triphosphate remdesivir triphosphate was found to accumulate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggesting a loading dose that could accelerate the achievement of a steady state 23 these characteristics support the dosing regimen used in clinical studies to date 200 mg intravenously on the first day followed by 100 mg intravenously once daily 510 days total detailed information regarding remdesivir metabolism and elimination is unavailable 23 remdesivir exhibits broad in vitro antiviral action against zoonotic and human pathogens from multiple virus families table 1 remdesivirs activity has been consistent when tested against members of the filoviridae paramyxoviridae pneumoviridae and coronaviridae
6 among hcov remdesivir inhibits three of the endemic strains associated with respiratory illness hcov-oc43 229e and nl63 as well as the less common mers-cov sars-cov and novel sars-cov-27924 in addition remdesivir possesses activity against sars-like and mers-like bat coronaviruses hku3 wiv1 shc014 and hku5 7 although most preclinical research has been in vitro remdesivir was also effective in non-human primate nhp models of mers nipah virus infection and evd52526 remdesivir is less potent against the flaviviridae with moderate activity against hepatitis c dengue and yellow fever viruses 6 remdesivir has poor-to-negligible activity against tick-borne flaviviruses alkhurma hemorrhagic fever kyasanur forest disease omsk hemorrhagic fever tick-borne encephalitis and west nile lassa vesicular stomatitis rift valley fever and crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever viruses 6 remdesivir was first identified during a broad screening for compounds with activity against emerging viruses 19 the original screening program was primarily geared toward identifying candidates that could inhibit rna viruses namely coronaviridae and flaviviridae subsequent to the 20132016 evd outbreak in west africa some previously screened compounds were further investigated against ebov remdesivir was observed to have high potency against ebov across multiple cell lines with an anti-ebov half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 0086 m in human macrophages remdesivir was chosen for continued clinical development based upon its potency and a chemical structure amenable to rapid scale-up 19 the first in vivo efficacy evaluation was completed in an non-human primate nhp model of evd 5 in the nhp evd model previously healthy rhesus monkeys received an intramuscular inoculation of ebov which results in death after a clinical course mimicking human evd nhp was challenged with ebov followed by receipt of various remdesivir dosing regimens the time from inoculation to remdesivir initiation varied between study groups as soon as 30 minutes after viral challenge and up to 3 days after viral challenge lower doses 3 mgkg daily demonstrated a measurable antiviral effect with survival rates between 33 and 66 however higher doses were most promising with 66 nhp surviving after receiving remdesivir 10 mgkg daily starting on day 3 this was the first report of a molecule providing post-exposure protection from evd and supported the further evaluation of remdesivir in human evd a limited number of case reports described the use of remdesivir for evd through emergency compassionate use protocols prior to the completion of formal clinical trials2728 the first case described the use of remdesivir for ebov meningoencephalitis in a 39-year-old woman who had fully recovered from an episode of evd 9 months earlier the second case involved an infant diagnosed with evd on her first day of life following birth from an ebov-positive mother 28 although both patients in these reports survived it is difficult to make conclusions regarding the role remdesivir played in their recovery as multiple therapies were administered a randomized multi-intervention trial was later conducted during the evd outbreak in the drc 18 patients of any age including pregnant women were eligible for enrollment if they tested positive for ebov patients received standard supportive care along with an assignment to one of four treatment arms in a 1111 ratio study treatments included zmapp a triple monoclonal antibody mab114 a single human monoclonal antibody derived from an ebola survivor regn-eb3 a mixture of three human immunoglobulin g1 igg1 monoclonal antibodies and intravenous remdesivir remdesivir was administered at a dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 913 days weight-based doses were used for pediatric patients the primary outcome was mortality at day 28 nearly 700 patients had been randomized when an interim analysis led to early cessation of the trial the data and safety monitoring board found higher mortality in the zmapp and remdesivir groups compared to the mab114 and regn-eb3 groups further the regn-eb3 group had met a prespecified threshold for efficacy a total of 673 patients were included in the final analysis the mean age of enrolled patients was 29 years and 56 of patients were women 6 of whom were pregnant at day 28 mortality rates were remdesivir 531 zmapp 497 mab114 351 and regn-eb3 335 for remdesivir 85 and 29 of patients with high- and low-viral loads at baseline died respectively in summary despite potent in vitro activity against ebov and unprecedented success in animal models of evd the journey of remdesivir for human evd culminated in disappointing results remdesivir was known to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses prior to the emergence of sars-cov-2 wang and colleagues published the first report affirming that remdesivir among other existing antivirals could effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 replication 29 the investigators evaluated the activity of seven drugs against sars-cov-2 in the non-human vero e6 cells ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine favipiravir and remdesivir the ec50 was lowest for remdesivir 077 m followed by chloroquine 113 m a simulated molecular docking experiment also predicted remdesivir would bind to sars-cov-2 rdrp with high affinity 30 a number of factors have led to the public and medical interest in remdesivir for the treatment of sars-cov-2 in recent times first in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 has been confirmed second remdesivir has an established dosing and safety profile finally effective treatments for covid-19 are desperately needed as the covid-19 pandemic spread gilead sciences inc facilitated emergency access to remdesivir through a compassionate use program for patients with severe disease and no access to a clinical trial individual requests for compassionate use have since been halted in favor of a newly expanded access program exception compassionate use requests for pregnant women and children 18 years old are still accepted 31 the initial clinical efficacy data for remdesivir in covid-19 have centered on the case reports wherein patients received remdesivir through the compassionate use process all cases described received remdesivir 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg for up to 9 more days the first patient diagnosed with covid-19 in the united states was treated with remdesivir 32 the patient was a 35-year-old man with a limited past medical history and recent travel to wuhan china he was admitted to a hospital for airborne isolation and monitoring remdesivir was initiated on hospital day 7 due to increasing oxygen requirements and ongoing pyrexia the patient improved the following day and was mostly asymptomatic at the time the report was published a more recent report describes the use of remdesivir in a 40-year-old man who was hospitalized with severe covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation 33 remdesivir was not started until day 13 of illness the patient was extubated 72 hours later and a full recovery was expected at the time of publication the authors hypothesize that remdesivir may retain a therapeutic effect even when started late in a disease course a non-peer reviewed manuscript is available that describes the outcomes of the first 12 patients in the united states with covid-19 34 three patients received remdesivir and all 12 patients clinically recovered retrospective cohort studies have been published detailing covid-19 outcomes in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and those with a history of solid organ transplant3536 in the ecmo cohort 35 survivors received remdesivir and 110 non-survivors received remdesivir in the transplant cohort only 290 patients received remdesivir and their specific outcomes were not reported grein and colleagues recently reported their experience with the compassionate use of remdesivir for covid-19 in a multicenter open label cohort that enrolled 61 patients of note this analysis included previously reported cases 37 compassionate use approvals were reserved for hospitalized patients with an oxygen saturation of 94 on room air or the need for oxygen support patients were required to have a creatinine clearance crcl greater than 30 mlmin and hepatic transaminases less than five times the upper limit of normal there were no predefined endpoints or enrollment goals a total of 53 patients were included in the final analysis 8 patients were excluded due to missing or erroneous data the median age was 64 years and 64 of patients were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline including 7 receiving ecmo the median time from symptom onset to remdesivir initiation was 12 days after starting remdesivir 36 of 53 patients 68 showed improvement based on their level of oxygen support of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation 1730 57 were extubated three out of four patients 75 receiving ecmo were able to stop ecmo seven 13 patients died the risk of death was increased in patients who were 70 years of age those with higher serum creatinine and those requiring invasive ventilation the authors suggest the 13 mortality rate is noteworthy given previously reported mortality rates of 1778 in severe covid-19 unfortunately conclusions regarding the clinical effect of remdesivir are hampered by the lack of a control group and delay in initiation of therapy additionally the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir was not assessed with viral load measurements the sample size was small and a substantial proportion of patients given remdesivir were eventually excluded from analysis 861 13 finally 4 months into the disease the data from randomized trials are beginning to emerge one of the first randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study in severe covid-19 was released at the time of manuscript preparation nct04257656 table 2 38 wang and colleagues randomized hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 in a 21 allocation to remdesivir n158 to matching placebo n78 38 remdesivir was given in the dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily on days 210 the primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement defined as a two-point reduction in disease severity on a six-point ordinal scale the baseline characteristics though largely balanced had higher proportion of patients with medical comorbidities and presenting later than 10 days with higher respiratory rate at baseline most patients required supplemental oxygen but not mechanical ventilation in the efficacy analysis time to clinical improvement was similar between groups median 21 days in the remdesivir group versus 23 days with placebo hazard ratio hr 123 95 confidence interval ci 087175 mortality at 28 days was also similar between groups 22 14 died in the remdesivir group versus 10 13 with placebo sars-cov-2 rna loads were not reduced with remdesivir compared to placebo the trial was halted before target enrollment was reached as the covid-19 outbreak subsided in the study region as such the statistical power was reduced from a planned 80 to 58 and the study remained inconclusive while the results of the study from china are inconclusive the preliminary results of the first randomized controlled study from the usa conducted under the auspices of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease adaptive covid-19 treatment trial have also been released nct04280705 table 2 on the same day through a press release 39 although full data release is awaited the preliminary analysis of over 1063 enrollments showed that the median time to recovery was shorter in those who treated with remdesivir compared to those treated with placebo 11 days versus 15 days p0001 the results also showed a trend toward survival benefit with remdesivir mortality of 8 in remdesivir arm versus 116 in placebo p0059 in absence of details it is also uncertain as to what proportion of the population received treatment with additional therapeutic agents for covid-19 finally in another press release gilead sciences inc summarized results of an open-label study comparing the treatment regimen of 5 versus 10 days of remdesivir for severe covid-19 nct04292899 table 2 40 clinical improvement was similar with either regimen however lack of placebo arm and limitation of the study details prohibit meaningful conclusions together these reports suggest a promising role for remdesivir for covid-19 though its effects on hard outcomes including mortality are still pending release of the full reports of these recently reported randomized studies and of the ongoing studies referenced in table 2 will be needed to judge the true efficacy and safety of remdesivir for covid-19 remdesivir has a low affinity for human rna polymerase ii and human mitochondrial rna polymerase which is expected to contribute to a favorable safety profile in humans 22 safety was initially evaluated in phase one of the dose-ranging studies 23 single doses from 3 to 225 mg were well tolerated with no observed toxicities multiple administrations of remdesivir 150 mg for 7 or 14 days led to reversible grade 1 and 2 alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate transaminase ast elevations remdesivir is not considered to have reproductive or developmental toxicity remdesivir injection is formulated with sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin sbecd 41 other drug products formulated with sbedc such as intravenous voriconazole carry warnings for sbecd accumulation in patients with renal dysfunction 41 however the clinical significance of vehicle accumulation is unclear 42 patients with crcl  30 mlmin have been excluded from remdesivir compassionate use and expanded access protocols thus far 31 some ongoing clinical trials table 2 are excluding patients with crcl  50 mlmin in the open-label covid-19 compassionate use cohort 37 3253 60 patients reported adverse events while 453 8 experienced adverse events leading to discontinuation the most common adverse events were increased hepatic enzymes diarrhea rash and renal impairment this constellation of events is difficult to interpret as there is a significant overlap with clinical attributes of severe covid-19 no new safety concerns were noted in the published covid-19 randomized trial adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 18 12 remdesivir patients and 4 5 placebo patients 38 reported adverse events were uncommon in the landmark evd trial the full toxicity profile will be further elucidated as results emerge from additional placebo-controlled trials in covid-19 there are currently seven randomized trials involving remdesivir registered on clinicaltrialsgov table 2 two of these trials both conducted in china nct04257656 and nct04252664 were recently terminated or suspended the information posted to clinicaltrialsgov indicates difficulty enrolling subjects as the covid-19 pandemic has come under control in the region of the two halted studies results have only been released for nct04257656 as described earlier 38 the remaining active trials include comparisons with placebo active comparators eg hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir short 5 days versus long 10 days remdesivir regimens and patients with moderate-to-severe covid-19 infectious disease outbreaks have shaped the course of human history and with every new outbreak come new challenges today scientists and clinicians around the globe are fighting to halt the covid-19 pandemic a chief concern remains there are no antiviral treatments proven to be effective in fully published peer-reviewed randomized placebo-controlled trials remdesivir has emerged as a promising candidate based on its in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 uncontrolled clinical reports and limited data from randomized trials however expectations should be tempered based on lessons from the past remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against ebov and was highly efficacious in an animal model of evd unfortunately early hopes for a new paradigm in evd management were deflated with the completion of the first randomized trial remdesivir holds promise for covid-19 but the first published randomized trial was underpowered and inconclusive high-quality data are still lacking at this time thus clinicians across the world now eagerly await complete results from additional randomized trials in covid-19 will remdesivir deliver  remdesivir for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing covid-19 an evaluation of the evidence yu-chen cao qi-xin deng shi-xue dai   sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single and positive stranded rna virus the virus particles are round or oval in shape with a diameter about 60140 nm based on sequence analysis it shows that the novel coronavirus belongs to beta coronavirus lineage  sarbecovirus where sars-cov and mers-cov are included however it forms a new clade different from sars-cov and mers-cov and becomes the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans 4 sars-cov-2 shows the typical beta coronavirus organization 5 untranslated region utr replication enzyme coding region s gene e gene m gene n gene 3 utr and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames fig 1
 4 the replication enzyme coding region mainly expresses and encodes two large genes orf1a and orf1b which encode 16 nonstructural proteins nsp1  nsp16 that are highly conserved throughout the coronavirus s gene m gene e gene and n gene respectively encode four main structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins the s protein is the receptor binding site which is on the viral surface the m protein shapes the virions promotes membrane curvature and is responsible for the transport of nutrients across cell membranes the e protein plays a role in the assembly and release of virus and is involved in viral pathogenesis the n protein can bind virus rna genome and maintain its stability 5 among them s protein plays a key role in virus recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors and mediating the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane 6 through the analysis of the whole genome sequence of sars-cov-2 it shares 40 sequence similarity with mers-cov and 80 sequence similarity with sars-cov indicating that sars-cov-2 is more compatible with sars-cov 7 in addition by performing systematic structural simulations and immunogenicity scans of the s proteins of all coronaviruses as well as calculating the immunogenic distance between sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus subtypes it can be concluded that the immunogenicity of the s protein of sars-cov-2 is closer to that of sars-cov 8 it is known that sars-cov enters target cells by binding the s protein to the ace2 receptor on the cell surface which is triggered by the cell serine protease tmprss2 9 in view of the 76 amino acid similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 10 we can speculate that the novel coronavirus may have a similar function to sars-cov which has been preliminary proved in bioinformatics prediction methods as well as in vitro tests 9 previous studies have shown that 4 of the 5 key amino acids of the s protein on the surface of sars-cov-2 that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the target cells have changed it was suspected it may affect the affinity of the s protein to ace2 receptor and in turn affect the spread of the virus among the public 10 however through calculation methods of molecular structure simulation the interaction between the s protein of sars-cov and the ace2 receptor has perfectly maintained in a holistic manner 11 at present it has been proved that the binding affinity between the extracellular domain of the s protein of sars-cov-2 and ace2 receptors is about 1020 times higher than that of sars-cov which may facilitate human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 12 covid-19 is a respiratory syndrome caused by sars-cov-2 infection in general covid-19 is an acute resolved disease and the most common symptoms at onset are fever dry cough and fatigue partly with nausea diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms compared with sars and mers covid-19 has milder clinical symptoms and lower fatality 1314 but it can also be fatal severe patients may develop diffuse alveolar injury progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and so on similar to sars-cov the receptor binding domain rbd of s protein on the surface of sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor on the cell surface to facilitate the virus entering the host cell then the virus exposes its rna translates its rna replicase and forms an rna replicase-transcriptase complex through transcription and replication the complex forms rna negative strands that will be translated for the structural proteins of the virus later then the structural proteins and rna in the cytoplasm assemble into new viral particles which are released from infected cells by exocytosis to infect other cells fig 2
 each infected cell produces thousands of novel viral particles that spread to bronchi eventually reach the alveoli and extrapulmonary organs causing pneumonia and targeted organic infections however the ace2 receptor is not only expressed in the respiratory organs it has been reported that by using the rna-seq method to express ace2 receptors in human tissues the number of ace2 receptors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract high in esophagus small intestine and colon but low in stomach kidneys and testes is nearly 100 times higher than that in the lung 15 suggesting that these tissues may also be the target organs for sars-cov-2 invasion it may explain why some patients with covid-19 developed other system injuries clinically besides respiratory system injuries furthermore it have been found that sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection is positive in the feces of some patients indicating that there may be live virus in the feces and the digestive system may be a potential route for covid-19 16 in covid-19 in addition to the direct damages caused by the virus the indirect immune injuries caused by the injured tissues also attract great concern which may be related to the severity and fatality of the disease previous studies have shown that pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung injury in patients with sars are associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-12 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 in serum 17 and it has been reported that the mers-cov infection induced elevated proinflammatory cytokine concentrations such as ifn- tnf- il-15 and il-17 in serum 18 we note that patients with covid-19 also have high levels of il-1 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 in their serum leading to activation of the th1 cell responses furthermore the concentrations of gcsf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf- in icu patients were higher than those in non-icu patients indicating that cytokine storms were associated with disease severity apart from this sars-cov-2 infection also activates the secretion of cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 in th2 cell responses that suppress inflammation which is different from sars-cov infection 17 further researches are needed to investigate the responses of th1 and th2 in sars-cov-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of covid-19 currently the pathogenesis of covid-19 is unclear the first pathologic autopsy of a patient with covid-19 demonstrated that the lungs of the patient reviews diffuse alveolar injury and pulmonary hyaline membrane formation consistent with ards the overall pathological manifestations of the lungs were similar to sars and mers flow cytometry signified that the number of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes in peripheral blood was greatly reduced but their state was overactivated other than this ccr4 and ccr6 th17 lymphocytes with highly proinflammatory effects increased in cd4 t lymphocytes cd8 t lymphocytes had a high concentration of cytotoxic granules of which 316 were perforin positive 642 were particle lysin positive and 305 were both particle lysin and perforin positive it manifests that the severe immune injury in this patient may be closely linked to the overactivation of t lymphocytes characterized by the increase of th17 lymphocytes and the high cytotoxicity of cd8 t lymphocytes 19 we presume that the failure to develop a full adaptive immune response to covid-19 could be due to the progression of pneumonia was too rapid to allow the available establishment of adaptive immune responses likewise the counts of peripheral cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes were substantially reduced leading to insufficient immune defenses furthermore peripheral t lymphocytes are in an over-activated state manifested by increase of th17 and high cytotoxicity of cd8 t lymphocytes accounting for to a certain degree of immune injury in patients this over activation not only failed to establish an immune response but also caused tissue injuries mostly manifested as severe injury in the lungs and some patients died of multiple organ failure this situation further accelerates the deterioration and shortens the course of the disease hampering the establishment of fully adaptive immune response the immunopathological injuries caused by the over activation also provides us with an idea for treating covid-19 for example we can probably apply the il-17 inhibitor secukinwmab directed against th17 cell activation but it still need more exploration also vaccines are also one of the solutions to make up for the lack of adaptive immune response the latest study terms that the changes of viral nucleic acid in patients with covid-19 is similar to that in patients with influenza but different from those with sars viral load can be detected not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic patients pointing out the potential for virus transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients these findings are coherent with reports evidencing that the virus transmission may have occurred early in infectious processes illustrating that case detection and isolation may require a different strategy from that required to control sars-cov 20 remdesivir gs-5734 is a nucleoside analogues drug fig 3
b with extensive antiviral activity and effective treatment of lethal ebola and nipah virus infections in nonhuman primates 21 as an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor it can inhibit the replication of multiple coronaviruses in respiratory epithelial cells a recent study reported that remdesivir competes with natural counterpart atp once remdesivir added into the growing chain i position it cannot cause an immediate stop on the contrary it will continue to extend three more nucleotides down to stop the strand at i  3 position fig 2 22 in the ces1c  mouse sars model the preventive treatment trial of remdesivir achieved satisfactory results administering 1 day after the onset of the disease lung virus titers decreased significantly with improvements on pulmonary function administering 2 days after the onset the pulmonary virus titer can be obviously reduced but the survival rate of mice is still relatively low this study implied that when the pulmonary injuries reach the maximum simply reducing the virus titer can no longer suppress the strong immune responses in mice also showing that administering before the peak of virus replication can significantly improve symptoms of the infected mice 23 in a rhesus monkey model infected with mers-cov treating with remdesivir 24 h before infection can completely prevent symptoms caused by mers-cov strongly inhibit viral replications in the respiratory tract and prevent the formation of pulmonary lesions administering remdesivir 12 h after infection provides clear clinical benefits reducing clinical symptoms lung virus replication and lung lesions 24 pharmacokinetic experiments in cynomolgus monkeys showed the first-pass effect of oral remdesivir resulted in a low bioavailability of the drug intramuscular injection of 3 mgkg had a 50 survival rate compared with the control group administering intravenously at a dose of 10 mgkg remdesivir rapidly decomposed into the original drug nucleoside phosphate in rhesus monkeys within 2 h remdesivir quickly distributed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and soon afterwards activated to nucleoside triphosphate to reach a peak with a survival rate of 100 25 as for pharmacokinetic studies in vivo after the intravenous infusion of the remdesivir solution formulation at a single dose of 3225 mg for 2 h it showed dose-linear pharmacokinetics intravenous infusion of 150 mg of a remdesivir solution repeated 1 h per day showed a linear pharmacokinetics over a period of 14 days after intravenously injecting 75 and 150 mg of remdesivir solution formulations over 2 h the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of a lyophilized formulation intravenous infusion of 75 mg of drug over 30 min provides similar levels of parent drug exposure to the same dose over 2 h table 1
 after the intravenous infusion remdesivir will enter the cellular metabolism to form active gs-443902 fig 3c but the frequencies of pbmcs exposure of gs-443902 is higher than those of intravenous infusion of remdesivir 150 mg within 2 h studies in pbmcs show that the half-life of gs-443902 is more than 35 h 26 in the case of daily administration the active substance of the drug gs-443902 will accumulate in vivo as a result in large-scale clinical trials after the first dose of 200 mg is administered the subsequent dose is adjusted to 100 mg to ensure the proper blood concentration in vivo 27 intravenous infusions in previously phase i clinical trials have good safety and pharmacokinetic properties also no cytotoxicity hepatorenal toxicity or no serious adverse reactions related to metering have been observed in climbing experiments subjects were tolerant in studies that repeated 150 mg intravenously daily for 714 days remdesivir did not show any renal injuries in a multi-dose study 26 phase ii clinical trials were conducted in ebola virus-infected patients in clinical trials of anti-ebola drugs the fatality rate of patients in the experimental group using remdesivir was 53 and the efficacy was significantly worse than that of the two monoclonal antibodies mab114 fatality rate 35 and regn-eb3 fatality rate 33 27 the 53 fatality rate was not significantly different from the average 50 fatality rate of ebola virus infection and as a result phase ii clinical trials were stopped nevertheless in consideration of ebolas high lethality and monoclonal antibodies with more obvious therapeutic effects when there are merely 175 patients injected remdesivir we cannot assume remdesivir of no avail the small sample size is not enough to deny the effect of remdesivir moreover receptors of ebola virus are widely distributed in vivo not only to the respiratory tract but also to the digestive tract urinary tract and blood system etc causing mortally hemorrhagic fever in addition ebola virus persists in the eyes and central nervous system for long 28 once remdesivir entering body it will be quickly distributed to the testis epididymis eyes and brain but relatively less in eyes and brain 29 all these indicate that the wide range of spread of ebola virus in the high lethality tissues make remdesivir control ebola ineffectively the wuhan virus research institute conducted in vitro experiments on covid-19 of remdesivir and found that remdesivir was the fastest-acting and most powerful antiviral agent in the primary culture of human airway epithelial cells in vitro sars-covs ic50  0069 m mers-covs ic50  0074 m and the dose-dependent effect on virus inhibition 2 which is speculatively related to the fact that remdesivir triphosphate cannot be removed by nsp14-exon 30 it has been conjectured the loss of function of exonuclease may be involved with the three additional nucleotides added after the incorporation of remdesivir into the extended strand 22 in vitro and animal models remdesivir has demonstrated activity against both sars and mers that also belong to coronaviruses and theoretically provides support its effectiveness in treating covid-19 presently there have been successful cases of remdesivir in the treating covid-19 the new england journal of medicine reported the entire course of rehabilitation of the first patient with covid-19 in the united states the patient once visited wuhan but was neither directly exposed to wuhan seafood market nor had direct contact with the diagnosed patients he returned to washington on january 15 2020 on 19 january due to cough and fever for four days he went to the hospital for emergency treatment and was then diagnosed with covid-19 his condition was stable from the second to the fifth day of admission the sixth to ninth day of onset on the evening of the fifth day of admission the blood oxygen saturation decreased to 90 the condition continued to worsen and chest radiographs on the sixth day of admission tenth day of onset showed typical characteristics of covid-19 in view of the continuous aggravation of the patients clinical symptoms the physicians gave a chartered medication compassionate use to remdesivir on the evening of the 6th day of admission and began to give intravenous to the patient on the evening of the seventh day of admission the eleventh day of onset without adverse reactions vancomycin was discontinued that night and cefepime was discontinued the following day on the eighth day of admission the twelfth day of onset the patients clinical symptoms were improved and the oxygen saturation increased to 94 although the patient was still hospitalized as of january 30 2020 all symptoms had been resolved except for cough and occasional running nose 31 it is worth noting that from the data in the article it can be found the viral load of patients has decreased before remdesivir injection table 2
 which is not described in detail in the original report its known that the viral infection is self-limiting and the patient is a mild to moderate infectious case with a controlled fever in time thus it is possible that his recovery is related to the role of self-defense mechanisms and supportive treatment as well it cannot be inferred that the improvement of patients condition after taking the drug is definitely connected to remdesivir whether there is a link between the improvement of the symptoms and the drug is worth further consideration clinical symptoms especially respiratory symptoms have been improved significantly within 24 h bringing hope for the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 for covid-19 no specific medication is available remdesivir is expected to be a specific drug however for the acute infectious diseases reducing the number of viral copies in the body is the key point also the efficacy of the drug should be focused on the pharmacokinetics and kinetics data of covid-19 in the ongoing phase iii clinical trials the outbreak of sars-cov-2 in wuhan constituted an epidemic threat in china the world health organization announced it a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 during the outbreak the number of confirmed cases in china showed an exponential growth the people and the government of the country tried their best to fight the epidemic with soaring combat mood the nations enthusiasm to fight the epidemic provides the trials on covid-19 a favorable environment at the same time article 23 of chinas new drug administration law which came into effect on december 1 2019 has enabled the compassionate use to develop adaptively in china two clinical trials on remdesivir have passed the most stringent ethical review of the 74 projects on february 5 2020 the trial has officially launched with experimental drugs provided by gilead sciences for free in china by professor chen wang an academician of chinese academy of engineering an internationally renowned respiratory expert who successfully suggested chinese government building fang cang hospitals to cure more than 10 thousand mild or prepatent covid-19 patients 32 due to the large number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in china with no effective drugs it is easy to collect clinical samples for trials theoretically however the rigor of the included samples hindered recruitment as public attach more attention on prevention and treatment fewer patients meet stringent inclusion criteria resulting in a slow recruitment process another reason is that there are plenty of drugs in the clinical trials speeding up the patients leaving hospital nevertheless it has been reported that more severe patients have been recruited which provides favorable conditions for the trial of the severe group and as a result at least it can be rapidly applied to the clinical treatment of severe patients in the near future the need of treatment on covid-19 is urgent so if the results of clinical trials prove it has the potential to benefit the treatment according to chinas compassionate use remdesivir will be more immediately used in patients with severe illness meanwhile the opening of green channels under special circumstances to speed up the review and approval process of the drug approval center will undoubtedly help save the lives of critical patients and promote the developing of specific drugs in the absence of clinical trial results it is still difficult to put remdesivir into large scale clinical use 33 with the political support the rapid development of clinical trials on remdesivir is imperative a drug gs-441524 compound a fig 3a for treating feline infectious peritonitis fip caused by coronavirus infection in cats has been tested in cats its safety and effectiveness in treating fip have been proven 34 with fdas approval it can be seen from the structure that remdesivir is phosphorylated from gs-441524 with identical target rdrp fig 2 it is noteworthy that though coronavirus reproduces more than 20 generations in gs-441524 yields resistance the resistant virus is still sensitive to high concentrations of remdesivir and the fitness of the resistant virus has reduced to the same level as wild-type mers-cov 35 which avoids resistant mutant coronaviruses from producing resistant supervirus at the beginning of developing remdesivir gilead science selected a large number of nucleosides or their prodrugs to conduct in vitro growth inhibition experiments on ebola-infected human microvascular endothelial cells in the laboratory and found compound a showed inhibitory activity ec50  078 m and the compound a was gs-441524 thereafter on the basis of compound a after examining the activity and toxicity of compounds surrounding compound a modifying the prodrug and optimizing amino acids and acyl groups the cynomolgus monkey performs a pharmacokinetic test to select a structure such as gs-5734 fig 3b 25 although in phase ii it was not as effective as competitive drugs and clinical trials were terminated remdesivir showed good safety and pharmacokinetics in both phases i and ii clinical trials covid-19 has once again brought remdesivir to the stage of clinical trials whether the results of phase iii clinical trial will make its comeback to the stage is worthy of expectation phase ii clinical trials have demonstrated human tolerance to remdesivir of the 175 patients in the phase ii clinical trial administering remdesivir 9 were reported to have serious adverse reactions 8 of whom were considered not related to drugs and 1 with severe hypotension was thought to be drug-related but still not confirmed 27 the gs-441524 a drug used to treat fip has shown a high degree of safety in feline trials as well the focal injection site reactions only showed in immediate pain with vocalization occasional growling and postural changes lasting for 3060s these initial reactions were relieved after the owners became more adept at administering the injection except for a cat with a slight increase in urea nitrogen and sdma of the third round of treatment no other symptoms of systemic poisoning were observed 34 relevant research signified that through a large number of synthesis and structure-activity analysis the toxicity was greatly reduced after gs-411524 was synthesized into gs-5734 remdesivir 36 the safety of remdesivir in human is further speculated coronaviruses must replicate nucleic acids to generate new progeny virus after entering human cells sars-cov-2 is known to be single stranded rna virus so rdrp must be used to replicate nucleic acids remdesivir a nucleotide analogues act as rdrp inhibitor can provide a scheme for blocking rna replication related studies have found that it plays a role in the final stage of entering the cell which is consistent with its expected mode of action wuhan virus research institute carried out a vitro inhibition test and found that remdesivir can block virus infection at very low micromolar concentration of vero e6 cells infected with virus and the cell selectivity is high ec50  077 m cc50  100 m si  12987 2 in an anti-ebola infection experiment on cynomolgus monkeys intravenous injection of 10 mgkg of remdesivir the drug can exist in the blood for a long time and can inhibit to ebola virus with a percentage of 100 25 wuhan virus research institutes research that applied remdesivir to vero e6 cells with an ec90  176  lower than that of the monkey model draw to a speculation that it could also play a role in sars-cov-2 infected monkeys based on the effectiveness in previous researches although there are many unknowns and limits of remdesivir the phase iii clinical trials on sars-cov-2 are not only a fight against this epidemic but also of strategic importance to reserve more effective antiviral drugs for the future strategic reservation for antiviral drugs will avoid the difficulty of medicine unavailable when an outbreak comes again remdesivirs situational and political superiority as well as its previous research results and application effects make it imperative to carry out the clinical trials focusing on the sars-cov-2 given that sars-cov-2 is an rna virus that is easy to mutate the rapid starting of clinical trials is undoubtedly a right choice to prevent the resistance mutation due to blind medication it has been covered in the world health organization who director-generals opening remarks at the media briefing on covid-19 on february 20 2020 that the two clinical trials on remdesivir of therapeutics prioritized by the who rd blueprint are expected preliminary results in three weeks on february 24 the who cast a vote of confidence for gilead sciences experimental antiviral drug remdesivir indicating that remdesivir has great potential and may be the best candidate for the treatment of covid-19 whatever the progress of the clinical trials is we are expecting that the clinical trials of remdesivir a starring drug would bring outstanding breakthroughs to the treatment of covid-19 or more promisingly other virus infection in the future

covid-191 coronaviruses primarily cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and
humans2 discovered in the 1960s they were originally thought to be
only responsible for mild disease with strains such as hcov 229e and hcov oc43 responsible
for the common cold3 that changed in 2003 with the sars pandemic and in
2012 with the outbreak of mers both zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates
greater than 10 and 35 respectively4 both coronaviruses likely
emerged from native bat populations which maintain a broad diversity of coronaviruses and
were transmitted through an intermediate host to humans loss of natural habitat and
increased exposure to new hosts are likely responsible for the increased frequency of
zoonotic infections originating from bats56 evidence also supports that the novel coronavirus which
emerged in the wuhan region of china in late 2019 also originated from bats7 this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 resulted in an outbreak of pathogenic
viral pneumonia in wuhan hubei province china as reported to the world health
organization who in december 2019 subsequent spread has led to a global pandemic
officially declared by the who on march 11 20208 covid-19 disease appears to be a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from
asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure common symptomology at the onset of illness are
fever cough and general myalgia with less common symptoms including sputum production
headache and diarrhea911 an initial case analysis
from china through mid-february 2020 found 14 of cases were associated with severe disease
dyspnea respiratory frequency  30min blood oxygen saturation  93
partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio  300 andor
lung infiltrates  50 within 2448 h and 5 of cases were critical ie
respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure12 a more extensive meta-analysis found a slightly higher severe disease
percentage 20313 the disease case fatality rate cfr varies
depending on region population demographics and heath care capabilities for instance in
italy an overall cfr of 72 is estimated in part driven by the higher proportion of
individuals of advanced age compared to china14 on the basis of global
data the cfr from covid-19 based on confirmed cases is estimated to be 6915 disease progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome typically occurs
in older patients over 63 often with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension
or diabetes16 elevated risk of mortality was associated with advanced
age sepsis blood clotting deficiencies1718 in individuals less than 60 years of age an increased body
to mass index over 30 was associated with increased disease severity and progression to
acute respiratory distress syndrome19 other symptoms including
neurologic symptoms and coagulopathies have also been reported in a portion of infected
individuals2024 similar to other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 primarily infects the respiratory and
gastrointestinal tract with a cell tropism of nasal epithelial cells pneumocytes and
alveolar macrophages in the lung and enterocytes in the bowel2527 although not limited to only these specific cell types evidence does
support that cell binding via the viral s protein to the host receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is required for infection figure
12829 following entry of the virus into the host cell the virus complex is
then translocated to the endosome where endosomal acid proteases cleave the s protein
mediating membrane fusion28 the viral genome is released and translated
into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved into functional
proteins by viral proteases subgenomic templates for mrna synthesis and translation of the
viral structural proteins occur through discontinuous transcription2
viral genome replication is mediated by the viral replication complex which includes an
rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase exonucleasen and other accessory proteins
subsequent assembly of viral nucleocapsids from the packaged viral genomes and translated
viral structural proteins occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate
compartment30 with infectious virions then released from the cell
through exocytosis as a new disease sars-cov-2 does not have any clinically proven therapeutics furthermore
a significant amount of preclinical research was reported in the search for therapeutic
treatments for the related viruses sars and mers as the sars and mers coronavirus outbreaks
did not persist no therapeutic or vaccine development programs were completed the
consequence is that drug repositioning and repurposing has received a significant amount of
attention31 and approved agents including hydroxychloroquine
azithromycin ritonavir ruxolitinib and camostat have entered clinical trials to address
the current sars-cov-2 pandemic figure 13234 although some candidates
do have pre-existing data to support activity against coronaviruses other repurposing
candidates for potential use against sars-cov-2 are based on their ability to inhibit
sars-cov-2 viral replication in vitro293537 these include hydroxychloroquine a known autophagy
inhibitor that suppresses lysosomal function38 and the serine protease
inhibitor camostat29 the ability of these compounds to act as
prophylactic agents treat disease or even modulate viral replication in
vivo has not been demonstrated although clinical evaluation of several of these
potential therapeutics is ongoing one of the first clinical candidates that has received attention is remdesivir a
pre-existing drug candidate developed by gilead sciences as part of an antiviral development
effort with initial results against ebola virus ebov reported in 201539 it was recently authorized for compassionate use and has now entered controlled clinical
trials like all other therapeutic approaches for patients with covid-19 remdesivir was not
developed specifically to treat covid-19 and here we review its discovery and mode of
action remdesivir gs-5734 was developed by gilead sciences and emerged from a collaboration
between gilead the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the us army
medical research institute of infectious diseases usamriid they sought to identify
therapeutic agents for treating rna-based viruses that maintained global pandemic potential
such as those that indeed emerged following the initiation of the program including ebov
and the coronaviridae family viruses exemplified by middle east respiratory
syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars as a starting point for discovery a library of 1000 small molecules focused around
nucleoside analogues was compiled based on prior knowledge of effective antiviral compounds
targeting rna viruses nucleosides are poorly cell-permeable and therefore can have a low
hit rate in cell-based screens such as antiviral screens so modified nucleosides such as
monophosphate ester and phosphoramidate prodrugs composed a significant portion of the
library such prodrugs are typically more permeable and metabolized to liberate the
nucleoside or phosphorylated nucleoside within cells4042 while the data from the original full screen does not appear to have
been disclosed a 1-cn modified adenosine c-nucleoside hit gs-441524 along with a
prodrug form of the monophosphate of gs-441524 gs-5734 later renamed as remdesivir was
found to be highly potent43 gs-441524 and its
s-acyl-2-thioethyl monophosphate prodrug had previously been reported in
2012 as potent leads from a series of 10-substituted 4-aza-79-dideazaadenosine
c-nucleosides with broad activity against a panel of rna viruses yellow fever virus yfv
dengue virus type 2 denv-2 influenza a parainfluenza 3 and sars44
the primary assay used was the cytoprotection effect cpe assay in which live virus is
incubated with a target cell line and the antiviral activity is inferred by the ability of a
test agent to rescue cell death measured using a standard cell viability reagent45 in a 2012 study gs-5734 showed cpe activity against sars strain toronto 2
ic50  22 m without causing cytotoxicity toward the host vero african
green monkey kidney epithelial cells used in the cpe assay note that different target cells
were utilized in viral cpe assays when the ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 the assembled library was utilized to identify
and prioritize compounds with efficacy against ebov the study by madelain et al found that
gs-5734 reduced ebov replication in hela cells with an ic50  100 nm and
it retained potency in in vivo nonhuman primate ebov infection models
while gs-441524 was inactive4647 in addition to demonstrating activity against ebov warren et al showed
that remdesivir also had antiviral activity against several other viruses including the
coronavirus mers with an ic50 of 340 nm in vitro with the demonstration that gs-5734 remdesivir possessed broad activity against rna
viruses multiple groups assessed antiviral activity both in vitro and
in vivo454849 validating its activity against coronaviruses antiviral
activity was confirmed against sars mers zoonotic coronaviruses49 as
well as the circulating human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e causative agents of the
common cold50 furthermore de wit et al demonstrated that remdesivir
had both prophylactic and therapeutic activity against mers in a nonhuman primate in
vivo model51 the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have been summarized in compassionate use documentation
published by the european medicines agency ema 2020 remdesivir is administered via an
intravenous injection iv with a loading dose on day 1 200 mg in adults adjusted for body
weight in pediatric patients followed by a daily maintenance dose 100 mg in adults for up
to 10 days in nonhuman primates daily administration of 10 mgkg of remdesivir yielded a
short plasma half-life of the prodrug t12 039 h but
sustained intracellular levels of the triphosphate form45 in vitro and preclinical in vivo animal models supported
the effectiveness of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 and related coronaviruses these include
a recent in vitro study of remdesivir assessing antiviral activity against
sars-cov-2 previously known as 2019-ncov strain ncov-2019betacovwuhanwiv042019 using
qrt-pcr quantification of viral copy number in infected vero e6 cells this study
demonstrated an ic50 of 770 nm and an ic90 equal to 1760 nm with
cytotoxic concentration 100 mm52 in addition works by sheahan et
al and de wit et al demonstrated in vivo efficacy of remdesivir at
inhibiting viral replication and reducing viral related pathology against related
coronaviruses5153
these findings along with the safety profile of remdesivir in the clinical trial assessment
against ebov54 support the evaluation of remdesivir as a potential
therapeutic drug for repurposing against the sars-cov-2 pandemic driven by the ebov outbreak in 2014 and based on in vitro and animal model
in vivo efficacy against ebov45 gilead sciences
initiated clinical evaluation of remdesivir for ebov gilead pursued fda evaluation under
the fdas animal rule permitting the reliance on efficacy findings from animal
studies for drugs in which it is not feasible or ethical to conduct human trials as such
remdesivir was included in a randomized controlled trial of ebola virus therapeutics in
patients within the democratic republic of the congo nct02818582 however midstudy
primary analyses found remdesivir inferior to the antibody based therapeutics mab114 and
regn-eb3 with respect to mortality and the remdesivir intervention arm was
terminated54 mulangu et al reported one serious adverse event related
to remdesivir an instance of hypotension along with elevated creatinine and aspartate
aminotransferase plasma levels a suggestive marker for impaired kidney or liver function
respectively in remdesivir-treated patients compared to either antibody based therapeutic
arms although remdesivir was inferior against ebov based on efficacy compared to antibody
therapy the study arm did provide an initial insight into the safety profile in
patients antiviral chemotherapeutic interventions often target specific viral enzymes or attack a
weak point of viral replication within the host such as targeting the divergent
rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp figure 2
nucleoside analogues represent a class of antiviral agents that has proven efficacious
against several viruses including hepatitis b and c as well as hiv generally these fall
into three general classes mutagenic nucleosides obligate chain terminators or delayed
chain terminators55 ribavirin a mutagenic nucleoside targets the viral
reliance on an rdrp to catalyze the replication of the rna genome from the original rna
template5657 in a
seminal paper crotty et al demonstrated that the rna virus poliovirus exists on the edge
of viability due to the proportion of virus particles with deleterious mutations
furthermore treatment with concentrations of ribavirin that caused a 97-fold increase in
mutations was sufficient to induce error catastrophe in effect lethally
mutating the poliovirus reducing infectivity by 99358 obligate chain
terminators such as azidothymidine azt lack the reactive 3-hydroxyl group which
directly prevents additional dna synthesis after incorporation59 lastly
delayed chain terminators which include remdesivir block transcription despite still
possessing the 3-hydroxyl and thus can still form a phosphodiester bond with the
next incorporated nucleotide however evidence suggests that the 1cn substituent of
remdesivir sterically clashes with rdrp residue s861 upon further chain elongation
remdesivir  three additional nucleotides distorting the positioning of the rna and
hampering translocation to the remdesivir  fourth position figure 260 remdesivir gs-5734 a prodrug is metabolized within cells into an alanine metabolite
gs-704277 further processed into the monophosphate derivative and ultimately into the
active nucleoside triphosphate derivative figure 3 nucleotide analogues are not highly cell permeable and once in the cell they
require di- and then triphosphorylation to produce the nucleoside triphosphate ntp that
can be utilized by the viral rna-dependent polymerases for genome replication as such ntps
can then be misintegrated into viral rna by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp
figure 2 to address this an approach to
antiviral drug design can employ the utilization of phosphoramidate prodrugs protides
inferred as prodrugs of
nucleotides6265 protides are composed of a nucleoside
monophosphate capped with an aryl group and an amino acid ester a phosphoramidate
following diffusion into the cell the prodrug is presumed to metabolize in a sequence of
hydrolytic steps that starts with esterase-mediated ester hydrolysis to a carboxylate that
cyclizes internally to the phosphonate ejecting the phenoxide the resultant unstable cyclic
anhydride is hydrolyzed open by water to the alanine metabolite gs-704277 whose pn
bond is hydrolyzed by a phosphoramidase-type enzyme figure 36669 this final step liberates the nucleoside monophosphate
which is highly polar and does not diffuse back across the cell membrane essentially
trapping it within the cell subsequent phosphorylation by host cell kinases convert the
compound into the ntp analogue that can be used as a substrate by the viral rdrp
enzyme70 while the nucleoside analogue core of remdesivir gs-441524
can diffuse into cells the initial phosphorylation step for nucleosides is rate-limiting
slow which is believed to account for the reduced antiviral activity of gs-441524
compared to remdesivir4971 this approach has been successfully applied to a number of fda-approved
antiviral drugs including the gilead products sofosbuvir for treating hcv and tenofovir
alafenamide first approved for treating hiv64 remdesivirs antiviral activity sterically interacting with the viral rdrp to
induce delayed chain termination has been demonstrated in vitro against
multiple coronaviruses sars mers contemporary human cov and bat-covs72 remdesivir was also shown to perturb pan-cov rdrp function by inhibiting viral
replication of sars mers and the model -coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv
even in settings with intact exonuclease proofreading activity45
biochemical data from recombinant respiratory syncytial virus rsv rdrp suggested the
primary mechanism of action was through delayed chain termination7375 importantly remdesivir inhibits viral replication demonstrated with
both ebola and rsv in cell-based assays with ic50 values of approximately 100
nm whereas human rna polymerase rnap ii and human mitochondrial rnap are not inhibited in
the presence of compound75 providing approximately 500-fold selectivity
this selectivity is achieved at least in part due to the nucleoside analogues being poor
substrates for the human polymerases76 interestingly in
vitro assays demonstrate that the triphosphate form of the inhibitor was
incorporated at increased rates compared to natural nucleotide pools77
likely adding to strong antiviral potency of remdesivir through premature rna synthesis
termination with the covid-19 outbreak increasing in size and a lack of alternative therapeutics two
clinical trials using remdesivir were designed and initiated in china on february 5 2020
a phase 3 randomized quadruple-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was registered at
capital medical university with the goal to determine safety and efficacy of remdesivir in
patients with mild to moderate sars-cov-2 infection nct04252664 since suspended78 a day later a second trial nct04257656 since terminated was registered
at the same location focused on patients with advanced covid-19 respiratory disease79 both trials had planned to track the primary outcome as time to clinical
improvement up to 28 days normalization of fever oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
and alleviation of cough which is sustained for 72 h both trials delivered remdesivir as a
200 mg loading dose on the first day with 9 subsequent days of maintenance dosing at 100
mg this regime is identical to that utilized in the previous nct03719586 ebola trial which
appears to be the model for all subsequent trials involving remdesivir discussed below
figure 4 and table 1 registered trials of remdesivir contemporaneous to the development of the chinese trials the first cases of covid-19 were
emerging in the usa on january 20 2020 a patient reported to urgent care in snohomish

2020 and february 5 202081 of these 12 patients seven were
hospitalized and three received remdesivir compassionate use access gilead sciences upon
worsening clinical disease treatment was continued for 410 days with 200 mg iv on
the first day and 100 mg each following day following the initial dose all patients
experienced transient gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea vomiting
gastroparesis or rectal bleeding although treatment was continued until
improvement in respiratory symptoms with all 12 patients reporting symptom resolution by
february 22 202081 the small sample size and lack of controlled
randomization preclude analysis of clinical efficacy or safety the national institute of allergies and infectious diseases niaid nih initiated the
adaptive covid-19 treatment trial actt a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled
phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir compared with a remdesivir

metrics with the overwhelming influx of compassionate use requests on march 23 2020 gilead
sciences suspended compassionate use access to remdesivir for all cases save children and
pregnant women shifting their focus to support mounting clinical trials and establish a
system of expanded access wherein hospitals or physicians can request emergency use of
remdesivir for multiple patients at one time95 in an open letter to the
public on march 28 2020 gilead ceo reported that they had provided over 1000 doses of
remdesivir through compassionate use requests96 to date the fda has
granted expanded access treatment protocols for remdesivir sponsored by the us army
medical research and development command nct0430276695 and gilead
sciences nct0432376197 the primary objective of these studies is the
provision of expanded access to remdesivir for the treatment of sars-cov2 infections gilead
sciences has acknowledged that production of remdesivir is an involved process and this is
being scaled up to meet demand remdesivir is certainly not the only nucleoside analogue that is being investigated for use
against sars-cov-2 but it is the most clinically advanced a recent publication by sheahan
et al describes the ribonucleoside analogue
-d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 that
has in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 and in vivo
against the related sars virus98 although in preclinical development
eidd-1931 is orally bioavailable a significant advantage compared to remdesivir and has
increased potency against viruses containing mutations in rdrp that conferred increased
resistance to remdesivir supporting the potential for a combination therapy to address the
risk of sars-cov-2 becoming clinically drug resistant other clinically approved
nucleosidenucleotide analogues such as the hepatitis c drug sofosbuvir and hiv drugs
alovudine and zidovudine have also been shown to be active against the sars rdrp in
in vitro biochemical assays and might have the potential to be repurposed
against covid-1999 for a general review of nucleoside and nucleotide
analogues for cancer and viral diseases including approved drugs and clinical candidates
please reference jordheim et al100 as the covid-19 pandemic races across the globe the scientific community from academic
and government laboratories to small biotechnology companies and multinational
pharmaceutical corporations has mobilized to develop and evaluate potential therapeutics
and vaccines101104 repurposing or repositioning an effective small-molecule
therapeutic promises to be the fastest therapeutic means to stem the tide of the
pandemic105106
among the candidate therapies remdesivir has demonstrated efficacy in both in
vitro and in vivo models against coronaviruses recently
through a compassionate use indication remdesivir has supportive evidence for yielding some
clinical improvement in covid-19 patients107 in addition an interim
analysis of the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial nct04280705 supports improvement in the
primary endpoint for patients receiving remdesivir compared to control with a 31 faster
time to recovery108 based on these initial findings the us food and
drug administration has issued an emergency use authorization for the emergency use of
remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients with no drug having fda
approval for marketing as a treatment for sars-cov-2 this is the first fda authorization of
an investigational therapeutic for use in treating sars-cov-2109 while
remdesivir represents one compound whose recent use authorization may in part mitigate the
morbidity mortality and strain on global healthcare systems caused by covid-19 additional
ongoing clinical trials will provide much-needed clarity surrounding the repurposing of
approved drugs and experimental agents against sars-cov-2  remdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis in obstructed kidneys ming wu lin xu bo tan di huang meijie yuan chaoyang ye  ye  aim kidney impairment is

reported in wuhan in late december 2019 has rapidly spread to the rest of the world 1 2  novel coronavirus pneumonia is becoming a worldwide public health event due to the rapid increase in new cases and the high severity and mortality 1 2 3  a latest research shows that covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit were older median age 66 vs 51 and more likely to have comorbidities 722 vs 373 than patients not in the intensive care unit suggesting that elderly people or patients with underlying disease have higher disease severity 3 chronic kidney disease ckd is a common disorder and the prevalence of ckd is around 10 in adults 4 5 thus ckd patients combined with covid-19 should be drawn enough attention from nephrologists it is worth noting that the 2019-ncov can not only cause pneumonia but also damage other organs such as the heart liver and kidneys 6 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 mediates the entry of 2019-ncov coronavirus into human cells 7 it has been found that ace2 is highly expressed in renal tubular cells implying that 2019-ncov may directly bind to ace2-positive cells in the kidney and thus induce kidney injuries 7 indeed a clinical study reported that 2706 of patients with covid-19 exhibited acute renal failure arf while elderly patients 60 years were more likely to develop arf 6522 vs 2419 8  a further immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the antigen for 2019-ncov accumulates in renal tubules 8  another clinical study with 59 covid-19 patients showed that proteinuria occurred in 63 of patients 9  19 and 27 covid-19 patients have elevated plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels respectively 9  a consecutive cohort study with 710 covid-19 patients further shows that the prevalence of renal impairment is high which is associated with in-hospital death 10  therefore enough attentions should be paid to kidney protection of covid-19 patients and the effect of anti-covid-19 agents on the kidney should also be concerned renal interstitial fibrosis is a common pathway and main pathological basis for the progression of various chronic kidney diseases to the end-stage renal disease esrd 11 12  it is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the kidney leading to completely loss of renal function 11 12  loss of renal tubule drives the development of renal interstitial fibrosis by producing a large number of profibrotic factors such as tgf- 12 13  it has been shown by several animal models that the tgf-  smad3 signaling pathway play a key role in renal fibrosis 14 15  remdesivir gs-5734 is a nucleoside analogue designed for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars the middle east respiratory syndrome mers and ebola virus 16 17  it can be anabolized to the active triphosphate metabolite and then incorporated into the newly synthesized rna strand of the virus as a substrate for viral rna-dependent rna synthetase rdrp thereby prematurely terminating viral rna transcription 16 17  in vitro study shows that remdesivir can effectively inhibit the infection of 2019-ncov 18  a single case study shows that treatment with remdesivir improved the clinical condition of the first severely infected covid-19 patient in the united states in 24 hours 19  currently several clinical trials using remdesivir as a treatment for infected covid-19 patients are undergoing around the world the first phase iii clinical trial which is conducted in china is expected to be completed in the end of april 2020 clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04257656 the aim of the current study is to determine the effect remdesivir on renal fibrosis gs-441524 the active metabolite of remdesivir was used to treat tgf- stimulated rat renal interstitial fibroblasts nrk-49f and huamn renal epithelial cells hk2 20  24 hours stimulation with 25 ngml tgf- increased the cell proliferation of nrk-49f cells as shown by cck8 assay and treatment with the figure   2d  mouse renal fibrosis model was established by uuo operation one day after sham or uuo operations mice were treated with vehicle or remdesivir for 10 days treatment with remdesivir had no effect on body weight of sham and uuo mice and all mice were survived during the treatment data not shown mild interstitial fibrosis was observed in vehicle treated uuo mice which was attenuated by remdesivir  figure 3a  the protein expression of fn collagen-i col-i psmad3 and  -sma were up-regulated in uuo mouse kidneys as compared with that in sham operated mouse kidneys and the treatment with remdesivir significantly reduced the expression of these pro-fibrotic proteins in uuo mouse kidneys  figure 3b  liver function alt and ast and renal function scr and bun were determined remdesivir has no effect on either liver function or renal function  figure 3c figure 3d  similarly serum or kidney ala-met can only be detected in remdesivir treated sham or uuo mice  figure 3d  remdesivir 1 mgml 50  lmouse or vehicle was infused retrogradely through ureter to the left kidney which was subjected to unilateral utero ligation uuo operation masson staining shows that interstitial fibrosis was attenuated in uuo kidneys at day7 by local remdesivir injection  figure 4a  the expression of fn col-i psmad3 and  -sma were reduced in remdesivir treated uuo kidneys as compared with that in vehicle treated control kidneys at day7 as shown by western blotting  figure 4b  liver function alt and ast and renal function scr and bun were not changed by remdesivir in uuo mice  figure 4c  the remdesivir metabolite gs-441524 can only be detected in serum and kidney at 1 hour after injection only in remdesivir treated mice which can not be detected at day7  figure 4d  the ala-met is abundant in remdesivir treated kidneys at 1 hour after injection and it was reduced to background level at day7  figure 4d  the effect of remdesivir on renal fibrosis is currently unknown in the present study we showed that remdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis first treatment with remdesivir or its active metabolite gs-441524 inhibited fibrosis in two cellular models for renal fibrosis second systematic administration of remdesivir inhibited renal fibrosis as shown by masson staining and western blotting third local infusion of remdesivir into uuo kidneys further revealed the anti-fibrotic effect of remdesivir the limitation of this study is that uuo model is not suitable to study the pharmaceutical effect on renal function uuo model is a classic model to study renal fibrosis although we did observe a slightly increase in scr and bun levels in uuo mice as compared with that in sham mice 21  the renal and liver function were assessed in this study to exclude the potential toxic effect of remdesivir and we show no effect of remdesivir on renal and liver function in this study the concentration of remdesivir was measured to assess the dosing efficacy however we are not able to detect remdesivir in serum or kidneys in two different dosing regimens or at different time points this is probably due to the rapid turnover of remdesivir by esterases which are abundant in blood and tissues 17 22  next we measured the concentration of two remdesivir metabolites alanine metabolite ala-met and nucleoside metabolite gs-441524 17  gs-441524 and ala-met can be detected at 1 hour after ip injection in serum and kidneys of sham and uuo mice gs-441524 was detected in the serum and kidney at 1 hour after renal injection but not at day 7 post-injection to prove the specificity of renal infusion of remdesivir we further measured ala-met which can only be detected in kidneys but not in serum at 1 hour after renal injection and it was not detectable at day 7 after renal injection in conclusion we showed that remdesivir

caused by sars-cov-2 3 and since march 2020 this outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the world health organisation who 4  fever cough and shortness of breath are the main reported symptoms of covid-19 5 but it also has a concerning case mortality rate among certain populations such as older adults and those with underlying health conditions currently there is a need to identify effective safe treatments for covid-19 as quickly as possible due to the ongoing pandemic one such proposed treatment is remdesivir which is an investigational antiviral medicine with proven activity against rna viruses 6 7  remdesivir was originally developed for treatment of ebola virus disease and results from the phase 3 randomised clinical trial for this indication have been published 8  it has been shown to have broad spectrum in-vitro activity against several coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 6 9 10 in-vivo activity against mers-cov in animal models 11 12  and has been made available for patients with covid-19 through compassionate use programmes 13 14  several clinical trials are ongoing to examine the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in covid-19 in humans 15 16 17 18  most recently remdesivir was granted an emergency use authorisation in covid-19 by the us food and drug administration whilst there is considerable interest in the use of remdesivir for covid-19 there has not been a systematic benefit-risk assessment on the use of remdesivir for covid-19 treatment using a structured descriptive framework the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk balance for remdesivir

explored further by sensitivity analysis through a quantitative component 21  this benefit-risk assessment has been conducted based on publicly available publications to date data-lock april 30th 2020

standard of care placebo or other treatments brat uses a six step iterative process to support the decision and communication of a benefit-risk assessment define decision context identify outcomes identify data sources customise framework assess outcome importance and display and interpret key benefit-risk metrics 20 21  we identified three settings of interest for use of covid-19 treatments treatment for severe disease treatment of milder disease in the community and prevention in health care professionals exposed to the virus we have focused on the use of remdesivir for the treatment of severe covid-19 disease within this benefit-risk assessment for the purposes of this study we considered severe covid-19 to include any patient who was hospitalised as a result of the infection the population of interest were patients with severe covid-19 while the exposure of interest was remdesivir the comparators of interest were standard of care placebo or other treatments for covid-19 regardless of importance all potential benefits and risks related to remdesivir were initially identified key benefits and risks were then selected by clinician judgement which were those considered to drive the benefit-risk balance of remdesivir the key benefits and risks were used to construct a value tree ranking benefits and risks in order of considered importance  cc-by-nd 40 international

comparator group due to paucity of data a fully quantitative assessment was not undertaken however the risks and risk difference per 1000 patients were calculated for each benefit and risk the outcomes identified in the value tree were ranked so that swing weighting can be applied in future assessments the weighted net clinical benefit wncb can subsequently be calculated using these weights 21 22 23  we would propose using the sutton et al method where benefits have a positive contribution to the wncb and risks have a negative contribution 23  the overall wncb would be considered positive benefit outweighs the risk where wncb 0 a sensitivity analysis can also be used to examine the robustness of the assigned weights and whether significant changes would alter the benefit-risk

generally improved outcomes in the remdesivir group compared to placebo including reductions in mortality risk of invasive and non-invasive ventilation and need for supportive oxygen at day 28 data

polymerase rdrp enzyme thereby it evades proofreading by viral exonuclease and arrests rna synthesis this drug has shown potent inhibitory activity against rdrp with intact proof reading and with low level of resistance to target mutations agostini et al 2018 it is supported in the study conducted by gordon et al who demonstrated rdrp is indeed the target of remdesivir in mers-cov strains gordon et al 2020 studies based on the molecular dynamics simulation and free energy perturbation methods clearly indicated sars-cov-2 rdrp as a target of remdesivir zhang and zhou 2020 though it has not been officially approved for ebola and coronaviruses yet siegel et al 2017 gilead sciences is working closely with organizations and health authorities to respond to the covid-19 outbreak through synthesizing and providing this investigational drug gilead sciences 2020a agostini et al demonstrated that remdesivir can potently inhibit coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in vitro agostini et al 2018 remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-1 and mers-cov replication in several in vitro systems including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures sheahan et al 2017 in research conducted by sheahan et al remdesivir showed superior antiviral activity to lopinavirritonavir against mers-cov in vitro sheahan et al 2020 in mers-cov nonstructural proteins nsp5 nsp7 nsp8 and nsp12 of insect cell lines remdesivir showed potent inhibitory activity against nsp12rdrp in vitro gordon et al 2020 yethindra et al demonstrated that remdesivir showed strong inhibition against sars-cov and mers-cov in human air way epithelial cells at early stages in replication process via inhibiting viral rna synthesis yethindra 2020 on the top of these remdesivir has shown promising results in clinical control of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in-vitro in human liver cancer cell lines wang m et al 2020 beyond beta-covs remdesivir has shown potent inhibition of human endemic and zoonotic delta-covs with highly divergent rdrp in human hematoma huh7 cell lines brown et al 2019 in a mouse model of sars-cov-1 prophylactic and therapeutic at early stage administration of remdesivir significantly reduced pulmonary viral load and improved respiratory function and other clinical signs of the disease sheahan et al 2017 likewise both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir has shown improvement on the pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology in mers-cov strains in mice model sheahan et al 2020 in the rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection remdesivir reduced virus replication the severity of the disease and lung damage when administered in animals infected with mers-cov de wit et al 2020 despite having an in-vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 there are no published studies justifying the activity of remdesivir in animal models of sars-cov-2 in vivo until the time of this review according to the paper published at the new england journal of medicine on 05 march 2020 it had been suggested that remdesivir might be a potential therapeutic option for the therapy of covid-19 patients in the report remdisivir intravenous infusion compassionate use was started on day 7 in covid-19 patient during the treatemnt no adverse events were observed in association with the iv infusion the patients clinical condition improved the bilateral lower-lobe rales apeared initially were no longer present his appetite improved became afebrile and asymptomatic except intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea holshue et al 2020 however this is a single patient report and is too infant to conclude its efficacy and disentangle the true effect size of this drug because of the chance of recovery from this disease without treatments hence it is imperative to have adequate well controlled randomized and blinded clinical trials in large cohorts of patients to justify its clinical utility in real settings as summarized in table 1 gilead sciences has initiated two phase 3 randomized open label clinical trials comprising approximately 1000 covid-19 patients in the first trial 400 patients with severe covid-19 cases were enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir on 5 arm 1 and 10 days arm 2 regimens with standard of care in both arms without comparator gilead-sciences 2020b in the second trial 600 patients with moderate covid-19 cases were enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the same dosage regimen of remdesivir in addition to the standard of care and with standrad of care alone as active comparator gilead-sciences 2020c with the coordination of china-japan friendship hospital two phase 3 randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trials were intiated in china to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir paralleled to palcebo therapythe first phase 3 trial has already involved 308 hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate cases of covid-19 cao 2020a the patients were randomized to intervention arms of either remdesivir 10 days regimen or placebo that matched to remdesivir the primary end point of this trial is set to determine the time to clinical recovery ttcr within 28 days another phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 10 days of remdesivir regimen in 453 hospitalized adult patients with severe covid-19 compared to placebo matched to remdesivir in dose and duration the primary outcome measure in this trial is the time to clinical improvement ttci censored at day 28 cao 2020b table 1 at the time of this revision the finding of the second trial was published on lancet though not statistically significant patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less hazard ratio 152 095243 in addition remdesivir did not show statistically significant clinical benefits wang y et al 2020 however the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in the larger cohort of patients and in the remaining trials with the coordination of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid another phase 3 adaptive randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial enrolled 394 hospitalized patients with covid-19 to assess the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in this trial patients were randomized to either placebo or 10 days therapy with remdesivir 200 mg remdesivir iv loading dose for day 1 followed by 100 mg iv daily maintained for 9 days total of 10 days therapy the primary indicator in this trial is the percentage of patients reporting each severity rating on the 7-point ordinal scale within 15 days niaid 2020 table 1 with the sponsor and coordination of us army medical research and development command amrdc remdesivir is also provided as expanded access compassionate use us-amrdc 2020 through emergency investigational new drug applications the term expanded access compassionate use is a potential pathway in which a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or disease gain access to an investigational medical product for treatment of patients outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available fda 2020 to this end remdesivir synthesized and developed by gilead sciences is readily available for compassionate use for covid-19 patients coppock 2020 table 1 latest observational study published on the new england journal of medicine revealed that severe covid-19 patients treated with compassionate-use of remdesivir showed clinical improvement in 68 cases grein et al 2020 on the top of this who has initiated solidarity trial at global level to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in one of the interventional arms branswell 2020 likewise national institute of health and medical research inserm of france has planned to initiate discovery trial inserm 2020 the trial protocol has already been registered on 20 march 2020 and available at httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04315948 the recruiting of participants has not been started but estimated to enroll 3200 patients in 4 arms in which remdesivir alone is to be provided in usual dosage regimen in one of the interventional arms despite the promising effects of remdesivir against previous beta-coronaviruses as well as the current novel coronaviruses in vitro there is no published in vivo study that substantiates the in vitro activities against this global public health threat a case report and observational studies are not sufficient to generate evidenced-based medicine on the clinical use of remdesivir for this pandemic a double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial showed that remdesivir did not have statistically significant clinical benefit in reducing the time to clinical improvement in severe covid-19 patients compared to placebo though remdesivir is readily available for compassionate use in many countries it is imperative to wait the remaining ongoing clinical trials to justify its clinical utility on larger cohort of covid-19 patients the author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and has approved it for publication the author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  current knowledge about the antivirals remdesivir gs-5734 and gs-441524 as therapeutic options for coronaviruses e amirian susan julie levy k   the first human coronaviruses hcovs were identified in the 1960s 1 and for the majority of the past six decades hcovs have generally maintained a relatively innocuous reputation as a cause of the common cold 2 however public perception and awareness of hcovs has shifted considerably in the last twenty years with the onset of three high profile outbreaks that have garnered international attention and have subsequently led to renewed interest in potential therapeutic options for hcov-related illnesses in 20022003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov infected more than 8000 people reaching 26 countries and resulting in a 10 case fatality rate 3 in the 7 years between april 2012 and november 2019 there were 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that reached 27 countries and had a mortality rate of approximately 34 4 though serologic studies have implied that the prevalence of mers-cov may have been underestimated 5 most recently the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in december 2019 in wuhan and its subsequent spread to over 160 countries across the world has generated intense interest in vaccine development and treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 67 remdesivir gs-5734 fig 1a is an investigational broad-spectrum small-molecule antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against rna viruses in several families including coronaviridae such as sars-cov mers-cov and strains of bat coronaviruses capable of infecting human respiratory epithelial cells paramyxoviridae such as nipah virus respiratory syncytial virus and hendra virus and filoviridae such as ebola virus 8 9 10 11 12 originally developed to treat ebola virus infection 8 remdesivir is a prodrug of the parent adenosine analog gs-441524 fig 1b both of which are metabolized into an active nucleoside triphosphate ntp by the host fig 1c 13 the parent nucleoside gs-441524 has displayed antiviral activity against sars-cov marburg virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus among others 914 15 16 a number of studies have examined the effects of these two drugs on coronaviruses covs both in vitro and in vivo using mouse and non-human primate animal models 9 10 11131718 there are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of cov-specific illnesses given the rapidly evolving pandemic of covid-19 it is crucial for public health practitioners and the one health community to stay up to date on potential therapeutic options that are under investigation 19 based on existing data remdesivir is a promising candidate and multi-site clinical trials of remdesivir are now underway among hospitalized adults with covid-19 20 this review summarizes the knowledge to date on remdesivir as a therapeutic option for covs viruses classified under the coronaviridae family are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that exhibit high genetic diversity 21 within the orthocoronavirinae subfamily there are four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus viruses in this family can infect a wide variety of host species such as birds humans and non-human mammals including dromedary camels alpacas domestic pigs dogs cats ferrets minks and bats 511121622 23 24 however to our knowledge only viruses of the alpha- and betacoronavirus genera infect humans 2 though those in the gamma- and deltacoronavirus genera have indirect effects through economic impacts on the agricultural production of poultry and pigs 12 host specificity is believed to be largely dependent upon variation in the cov spike attachment glycoprotein 23 although the infectivity of most strains is host species-specific host range is wide across different covs and some bat covs rely on the same host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace-2 as human covs to facilitate entry into cells 112526 it has been hypothesized that the cov propensity for host-switching may partly be attributable to recombination events that alter the spike protein which in turn affects interactions with host receptors eg ace-2 2728 historically hcovs were largely considered to be relatively low virulence viruses that produced less severe self-limiting disease and were predominantly known as the second most prevalent cause of colds and upper respiratory infections uris after rhinoviruses 229 the endemic human covs that cumulatively account for about 1030 of uris are hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 which are both alphacoronaviruses and hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 which are both betacoronaviruses 2 among patients with uris severe enough to warrant hospitalization one study found that approximately 5 of cases were attributable to rhinoviruses or hcovs but a substantial proportion of these hospitalized patients had underlying pulmonary or cardiac comorbidities that may have exacerbated their conditions 29 the virus underlying covid-19 sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus that is closely related to sars-cov these covs share 80 rna sequence identity 3031 the similarity is even greater between the viruses when comparing the sequences specific to a key drug target the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 90 sequence identity 30 by contrast mers-cov shares about 50 genomic sequence identity with sars-cov-2 31 and with the exception of some bat strains many animal covs are even less similar 12 as a nucleoside analog remdesivir acts as an rdrp inhibitor targeting the viral genome replication process the rdrp is the protein complex covs use to replicate their rna-based genomes after the host metabolizes remdesivir into active ntp the metabolite competes with adenosine triphosphate atp the natural nucleotide normally used in this process for incorporation into the nascent rna strand 32 the incorporation of this substitute into the new strand results in premature termination of rna synthesis halting the growth of the rna strand after a few more nucleotides are added although covs have a proofreading process that is able to detect and remove other nucleoside analogs rendering them resistant to many of these drugs remdesivir seems to outpace this viral proofreading activity thus maintaining antiviral activity 30 unsurprisingly agostini et al reported that a mutant murine hepatitis virus mhv devoid of proofreading ability was more sensitive to remdesivir 13 the opposite is also possiblethat mutations that improve proofreading or otherwise increase fidelity of the base-pairing process may result in remdesivir resistance 33 in fact agostini et al also induced mutations in mhv through passage in remdesivir that conferred strong resistance against the drug but these mutated strains were outcompeted by wild-type mhv in coinfected cell cultures that were not exposed to remdesivir 13 how well this experiment would represent a situation in which a resistance mutation developed naturally though is unclear nonetheless some evidence suggests that remdesivir could have an additional mechanism of action that has yet to be discovered which if true may allow for partial antiviral activity to continue despite viral mutations that enhance replication fidelity 11 12 13 the majority of in vitro efficacy studies conducted to date have reported positive results on the anti-cov activity of remdesivir and gs-441524 table 1 commonly used metrics in these studies are the half maximal effective concentration ec50 which is the drug concentration at which half of the maximum response is attained after exposure or the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 which is the drug concentration at which half of the peak inhibiting effect of the drug against a specific viral function is achieved lower ec50 and ic50 values indicate higher potency typical outcomes measured in such studies include the amount of viral rna eg copies of certain open reading frames in the culture the number of virus-infected cells in the culture or changes in viral replication rates in studies of sars-cov and mers-cov in human respiratory epithelial cell cultures remdesivir has demonstrated strong antiviral activity ec50  007 m for either virus with relative consistency and has been shown to be capable of inhibiting mers-cov replication at levels below those that would result in unacceptable cytotoxicity 1113 interestingly a study published in february 2020 by wang et al was the first to our knowledge to examine the effect of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 the hcov involved in the current pandemic 17 this study investigated the impact of seven different drugs on viral titers cytotoxicity and infection rates using vero e6 cells a cell line originating from african green monkey kidney epithelial cells they found low potency of most of these drugs for inhibiting sars-cov-2 ec50 values ranged widely from 1095 m for ribavirin to 113 m for choloquine and 077 m for remdesivir which were the two drugs that required the lowest concentrations for blocking viral infection a few in vitro studies have also investigated the utility of remdesivir against non-human covs for example a study by murphy et al reported anti-cov activity of remdesivirs parent nucleoside gs-441524 against an alphacoronavirus that only infects wild and domestic cats the feline infectious peritonitis fip virus ec50  078 m table 1 14 in 2019 brown et al observed some antiviral effects of remdesivir against sars-like bat covs specifically bat-cov hku3 bat-cov sch014 and bat-cov wiv1 and mers-like bat covs specifically bat-cov hku5 12 further this study detected a weaker antiviral effect against porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov table 1 particularly when tested in porcine cell lines among currently known covs pdcov has the least similar rdrp sequence compared to sars-cov and mers-cov only 6769 similarity in amino acid sequence 12 in fact the rdrp of pdcov has a different amino acid at a specific site phenylalanine to leucine at residue 483 a dissimilarity that has been previously associated with increased resistance to remdesivir in other covs 1213 therefore it was important to attempt to disentangle whether the lower antiviral activity observed could be related to a viral characteristic of pdcov or if it could be attributable to differences in the cell lines used while diminished potency of remdesivir against pdcov was noted in cultures of porcine kidney epithelial cells llc-pk1 in a human liver cell line huh7 the ec50 was relatively low ec50 not reached in llc-pk1 vs ec50  002 m in huh7 table 1 similarly the ec50 was substantially higher for antiviral activity against an endemic hcov 229e in the porcine cell line 38 m compared to 002 m in huh7 again indicating the likely lower potency of the drug in this context thus the observed variations in remdesivir potency against the same viruses in the different cell lines may imply that there is some factor associated with the cell line rather than the virus that may be affecting the drugs antiviral activity in fact the authors state that these findings may imply that llc-pk1 cells lack a cellular process necessary for remdesivir antiviral activity which could also support the hypothesis that remdesivir may have another mechanism of action that is not presently understood animal studies on remdesivir efficacy against covs have utilized transgenic mice and rhesus macaques 10111318 for example using a mouse model with a ces1c-knockout which better emulates human metabolism of remdesivir compared to wild-type mice and a humanized mers-cov receptor sheahan et al found that both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir had protective effects against mers-cov replication and associated pathology generally resulting in less lung damage and better pulmonary function compared to controls 10 interestingly among mice that were infected with a higher virus quantity ie more plaque-forming units those receiving prophylactic remdesivir one day before infection had significantly better 6-day survival than infected control mice that did not receive remdesivir however the mice were sacrificed before longer follow-up data could be obtained similarly in a rhesus macaque model of mers-cov pathogenesis prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir demonstrated favorable results reducing respiratory tract viral titers and pulmonary pathology 18 prophylactic use was initiated 24 h prior to viral challenge whereas therapeutic use was initiated 12 h after challenge while respiratory rate was not substantially different between the prophylactic therapeutic and control groups x-ray scores representing the severity of pulmonary infiltrates were significantly better in the prophylactic and therapeutic groups comparing each to controls 18 incidentally remdesivir has also been associated with beneficial effects including reduced severity of respiratory signs and improved survival against challenge with nipah virus which is a non-cov virus in the paramyxoviridae family in african green monkeys 21 in a ces1c-knockout mouse model of sars-cov infection prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment resulted in lower lung viral titers and if therapy was administered 1 day post-infection which is before peak viral replication it was associated with greater pulmonary function compared to controls 11 however there were no differences in disease pathology or survival if treatment was administered 2 days post-infection some veterinary studies have also examined the effects of the parent nucleoside gs-441524 in cats with fip a condition associated with very high mortality in cats 1416 gilead sciences foster city california had provided this drug to researchers at the university of california davis to evaluate its potential utility in veterinary indications 35 subsequently gs-441524 became an intermediate in the production of the prodrug remdesivir which has superior ability to transport the active compound into cells 918 because both drugs yield the same active metabolite in host cells some prior studies on the antiviral activity of remdesivir also investigate gs-441524 1518 andor discuss its relevance in the veterinary studies 912 in 2018 murphy et al examined the efficacy of gs-441524 against fip in 12 experimentally infected cats 14 controls were not included as historical data on untreated cats were available demonstrating a mortality rate close to 100 1436 after experimental challenge with the fip virus 2 cats did not develop fip-related signs and remained untreated 14 in the 10 infected cats treatment was initiated upon onset of fip-associated clinical signs 1018 days post infection and continued for 2 weeks of these cats half n  5 were treated with a 5 mgkg dose of gs-441524 administered subcutaneously once per day and the other half n  5 were treated with 2 mgkg daily if disease recurred after initial treatment cats were re-treated using the same regimen for another 2 weeks follow-up continued for 8 months all treated cats demonstrated favorable responses to gs-441524 treatment within 2448 h regardless of dose and were still alive and clinically unremarkable 8 months post infection two cats one from each dose group experienced disease recurrence at 4 weeks and 6 weeks after initial treatment and were re-treated adverse events related to treatment other than temporary discomfort at the injection site were not observed this study was based on a small number of animals and it is unclear whether experimental infection is a relevant representation of naturally-occurring fipv infection in cats future studies with additional follow-up time would be helpful for assessing whether unexpected long-term sequelae are observed in the cats since such information on surviving animals is sparse given the high fatality rate in a field trial of treatment with gs-441524 for naturally occurring fip pedersen et al treated 31 cats with an initial dose of 2 mgkg daily 16 within the first week of treatment 4 cats 13 with severe disease died or were euthanized a fifth cat died after 26 days and another was euthanized about 2-weeks post relapse due to the development of neurological signs and a lack of response to treatment the remaining cats completed at least 12 weeks of treatment but 8 experienced relapses requiring re-treatment with gs-441524 dose escalation from 2 mgkg to 4 mgkg daily was required for 5 cats a total of 25 treated cats 81 survived fip for at least 44 weeks of follow up indicating that gs-441524 and presumably its prodrug remdesivir is also a promising therapeutic candidate for treatment of alphacoronavirus-related disease in cats most cats in this study had wet or effusive fip the hallmark of which is the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal or thoracic cavities there were only 3 cats in the study with abdominal non-effusive dry fip which is a more chronic condition and another 4 cats initially had dry fip that progressed into wet fip one cat in the dry fip group and one in the dry-to-wet group did not survive because of the small number of cats with dry fip conclusions cannot be drawn about whether remdesivir has greater efficacy in the treatment of some clinical manifestations of fip than others a strength of this study is that it was conducted among animals with naturally-occurring cov infection as a field trial better representing real-world circumstances the first patient to present with covid-19 in the us was treated with intravenous remdesivir under the compassionate use clause after developing pneumonia in january 2020 37 this 35-year-old male had been infected during travel to wuhan and returned to the us where he was hospitalized for more than 12 days he was treated with intravenous remdesivir on the seventh day and his condition was reportedly improving on the eighth day no adverse events related to remdesivir use were noted the case report was written prior to the patients discharge human data on remdesivir use for covid-19 will likely continue to become available from compassionate use cases before the clinical trial is completed in fact there are many anecdotal reports already circulating about treatment of covid-19 patients with remdesivir according to a recent newspaper article 17 passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship were treated with intravenous remdesivir for 10 days and were alive at the time of article release one of the physicians involved in their treatment who is affiliated with the us national institutes of health nih felt that the patients were less dependent on ventilators after receiving the drug nevertheless no conclusions can be drawn based on such reports a preprint of a case series on the first 12 covid-19 patients in the us who had disease onset between january 14 and 29 2020 recently became available though it had not been peer-reviewed at the time of writing 38 this report authored by a team from the centers for disease control cdc described the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients as well as information on course of disease and clinical management seven of the 12 patients 58 were hospitalized and three of these patients received remdesivir intravenously at the onset of worsening symptoms two on the eleventh day of illness and one on the seventh day treatment with remdesivir was tolerated though temporary gastrointestinal upset and elevated aminotransferase levels were observed in all three patients after administration treatment was discontinued after respiratory symptoms improved total treatment durations of 4 days 5 days and 10 days it should be noted that one of these three patients is the same patient described in the case report discussed above 37 some safety data were formally collected during a clinical trial conducted in the democratic republic of congo that randomized 175 patients to be treated with remdesivir for ebola 39 incidentally randomization to remdesivir treatment was discontinued in this trial after an interim analysis showed superior survival for two other trial drugs despite preclinical and compassionate use data having been favorable for remdesivir against the ebola virus prior to the trial 9 interestingly patients who received remdesivir had slower rates of viral clearance compared to patients who received single-dose antivirals specifically mab114 and regn-eb3 which the authors hypothesized may be related to the fact that the treatment plan for remdesivir involved multiple intravenous infusions however for now information on the potential efficacy of remdesivir specifically against covs is largely limited to in vitro and animal studies though covid-19 related knowledge is evolving quickly overall past studies on other covs may have limited generalizability to the virus underlying the current pandemic because of the high genetic diversity of the coronaviridae family although broad-spectrum drugs tend to be directed at well-conserved targets 1140 in addition to this issue there are a number of factors that can impact how predictive findings from in vitro or in vivo models may be of clinical efficacy against sars-cov-2 for example drugs that may be effective in vitro may not have clinical utility if the therapeutic dose induces severe adverse events in the patient alternatively if the treatment dose does not attain an effective serum concentration in patients or if ec50 is greater than the achievable maximum serum concentration cmax then the drug is less likely to have therapeutic utility with regard to animal models how closely the model represents disease pathogenesis and drug metabolism in humans can be challenging to gauge multiple clinical trials are underway on the use of remdesivir for treatment of covid-19 41 the nih-sponsored clinical trial ongoing in the us and the republic of korea is a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in which patients are randomized to receive either placebo or an initial dose of 200 mg of intravenous remdesivir on the first day followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg per day through discharge up to a maximum of 10 total treatment days 20 the primary outcome of the trial as described in the us national library of medicine clinical trials registry will be expressed as the proportion of patients in each category of a seven-category clinical severity scale on the fifteenth day post treatment initiation table 2 42 additionally gilead sciences is sponsoring a remdesivir study among patients with severe covid-19 with a composite primary outcome measure of fever normalization and oxygen normalization 43 two double-blinded placebo-controlled trials are also recruiting in hubei province china 4445 one targets hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate covid-19 44 while the other is focused on severe cases 45 the primary outcome measure for the study on mild or moderate cases is time to clinical recovery as defined by normalization of body temperature respiratory rate and oxygen saturation and the resolution of cough for at least 72 h 44 in the study on severe cases time to clinical improvement is the primary outcome and is defined using a six-category scale ranging from discharge to death 45 while previous studies on remdesivir are promising formal clinical evaluation is strongly warranted in general there are many reasons why favorable preclinical data can fail to translate directly into human clinical trial results 46 such as inadvertent use of irrelevant models inability to achieve effective serum drug concentrations in patients or the occurrence of unanticipated severe adverse events among patients therefore postulating on expected results of the trials is extremely challenging nonetheless there are hundreds of clinical trials ongoing internationally on different drugs that utilize various mechanisms of action 4151 including trials on other nucleosides inhibitors eg ribavirin protease inhibitors eg lopinavirritonavir and interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors eg sarilumab 4147 another well-known candidate that is being evaluated in multiple trials against covid-19 is chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine which is already approved as an antimalarial and for extraintestinal amebiasis 4148 results of the clinical trials currently underway in the us and china will provide crucial information about whether remdesivir represents a viable treatment option for covid-19 2049 if the trial findings are ultimately positive it will be imperative to ensure that the drug is produced on a commercial scale capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and future outbreaks such a change in production may also allow for the added benefit of the drug becoming more available for agricultural and veterinary use for relevant indications this work did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors the authors report no relevant conflicts of interest es amirian was previously employed by mckesson specialty health where she conducted health economics and outcomes research contract studies however none of these studies involved gilead sciences  the use of convalescent plasma therapy and remdesivir in the successful management of a critically ill obstetric patient with novel coronavirus 2019 infection a case report jonathon anderson jordan schauer suzanne bryant cornelia graves r   since first being identified in december 2019 the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has rapidly spread around the globe and viable therapeutic options are an area of great interest at present there are nearly 35 million global cases of sars-cov-2 with nearly 250000 deaths treatments are rapidly evolving during the time of this deadly pandemic and several drugs remain under investigation as potential therapies for critically ill covid-19 patients proposed antiviral treatment options include hydroxychloroquine remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir which are all safe in pregnancy 1 other potential therapies which are contraindicated in pregnancy include ribavirin and baricitinib 1 ribavirin has teratogenic properties it induces miscarriages and leads to craniofacial and limb defects in mouse models 12 baricitinib has shown embryotoxicity in mouse models 13 remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerase remdesivir has previously demonstrated in vivo activity against both ebola virus 4 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 5 remdesivir underwent in vitro testing early in the sars-cov-2 outbreak at the wuhan virus research institute and was first used successfully in a us covid-19 patient in january 2020 6 early data on compassionate use of a 10-day course of remdesivir have shown a significant improvement in rates of extubation and reduction in mortality for covid-19 patients 7 and randomized controlled trials to assess its efficacy more completely are ongoing both in the united states and abroad a 35-year-old employee g7p4115 of an inpatient hospice center presented to the hospital via transfer at 22 weeks and 2 days of gestation with a chief complaint of hypoxia in the setting of known sars cov-2 infection the patients past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus asthma and class iii obesity the patient initially presented four days prior to an outside facility with a chief complaint of fever cough and myalgias she tested positive for covid-19 the patient was managed as an outpatient for four days until development of worsening dyspnea and hypoxia at this time she was transferred and admitted to the teaching hospital for higher-level care on arrival at the hospital the patient was noted to be hypoxic and in respiratory distress with oxygen saturation of 86 on 6 l nasal cannula the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit icu and placed on high-flow non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation chest x-ray on admission showed extensive bilateral consolidation suggestive of multifocal pneumonia with more extensive disease visible in the left lung repeat chest x-ray performed 24 h later showed interval worsening of consolidation of alveolar opacities consistent with both covid-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome medical therapy was initiated with transfusion of covid-19 convalescent plasma rocephin 2 g intravenous iv daily and azithromycin 500 mg iv for concern for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia hydroxychloroquine 400 g twice daily was initiated on the day of admission followed by 400 mg daily for three days given that periods of prolonged immobility such as extended mechanical ventilation are associated with increased risk of thromboembolic disease and that sars-cov-2 infection appears to cause a diffuse inflammatory reaction which places patients at an increased risk embolism this patient was anticoagulated for the duration of her admission with a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin early during the hospitalization a care coordination meeting was held to discuss the plan of care from an obstetric standpoint the society for maternal fetal medicine has advised that caution be used when giving corticosteroids for fetal lung development in cases of maternal covid-19 infection due to possible worsening of pulmonary function and viral shedding 8 taking into account this patients severe respiratory failure established co-morbidities and the limited fetal benefit of steroids at 22 weeks of gestation antenatal steroids were deferred during her admission it was also felt to be in the best interest of both the mother and fetus to forego delivery for fetal distress until 25 weeks of gestation on the morning of hospital day hd 2 the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation for worsening respiratory distress during the period of mechanical ventilation the patient was noted to have labile blood pressure with periods of intermittent hypertension and hypotension intermittent pressure support with iv ephedrine was provided as needed for hypotension a trial of prone ventilation was attempted on hd 4 and discontinued secondary to an episode of torsades de pointes given this new emergence of a cardiac arrhythmia hydroxychloroquine was also discontinued at this time the use of glucocorticoids for treatment of coronavirus infections remains somewhat controversial as early use of systemic glucocorticoids has been shown to increase viral load and potentially worsen disease course in patients with sars and early data shows that may also be the case in patients with sars-cov-2 specifically the use of high-dose glucocorticoids have been associated with detrimental effects in both sars and sars-cov-2 patients 9 10 11 however given the correlation of significant cytokine storm with severe disease the use of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids may be of use in patients who have already progressed to a critical disease state 11 as the patient had rapid progression from mild to critical disease with a known history of asthma the decision was made to initiate a short course of iv glucocorticoids with hydrocortisone 50 mg iv which was started as a three times daily dose and tapered over the course of five days appropriate steps to establish management of hyperglycemia were also initiated at this time application for compassionate-use remdesivir therapy had been completed on admission and the patient was subsequently approved for trial of use she was started on remdesivir on hd 5 with a 200 mg iv dose remdesivir therapy continued with 100 mg iv doses every 24 h for an additional nine days daily labs were obtained following remdesivir initiation to monitor for developing renal andor hepatic impairment mild transaminitis was noted with peak aspartate transaminase ast and alanine aminotransferase alt values of 49 and 51 on hd 8 the patient was gradually weaned off paralytics with an appropriate response after passing a trial of spontaneous breathing on hospital day 10 five days after the initiation of remdesivir therapy she was extubated and placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula oxygen requirements were gradually decreased and on hd 11 the patient was successfully transitioned to room air liver enzymes normalized no renal dysfunction was observed throughout the hospitalization no further episodes of cardiac arrhythmia occurred during this admission on hd 14 at 24 weeks and 2 days of gestation she was ambulating with mild shortness of breath vital signs remained stable and within normal limits and the patient was found to be appropriate for discharge following her final dose of remdesivir at the time of writing the patient had had no further issues after discharge and was continuing antenatal care with both primary obstetric office and maternal fetal medicine specialists this patients care was complicated by several factors in addition to her acute sars-cov-2 infection including the potential need for anticoagulation her existing respiratory disease the questionable viability of her pregnancy given its early gestational age and the potential use and efficacy of investigational therapies such as convalescent plasma and remdesivir the use of convalescent plasma transfusions for the treatment of acute viral illnesses is an established therapy which has previously shown benefit in the treatment of sars mers and ebola virus patients 12 at present no official recommendations for the use of convalescent plasma as a covid-19 therapy exist and research is currently ongoing however in a limited uncontrolled case series of five critically ill covid-19 patients who received convalescent plasma therapy all five patients showed significant clinical improvement 13 the hospital is currently participating in a trial of convalescent plasma therapy for inpatient management of severe and critical covid-19 infections and this patient was deemed eligible for a trial of therapy as such this patient was transfused one unit of convalescent covid-19 plasma on the day of admission remdesivir a pro-drug nucleotide analog of adenosine competes for an atp-binding site on rna-dependent rna polymerase and has previously been shown to have activity against both mers and ebola virus 45 at present no official guidance has been published for the use of remdesivir in the treatment of covid-19 but use under compassionate-use protocols it is available as research into the efficacy of this therapy is ongoing on the date of this patients admission an application was made for compassionate-use remdesivir therapy which was subsequently approved remdesivir was initiated on day 5 of this patients hospitalization by which time the patients status had deteriorated and she required mechanical ventilation as described following initiation of remdesivir the patient improved relatively quickly and was able to be extubated on day 5 of the 10-day course of remdesivir therapy the patient was able to be transitioned to room air 24 h later and was subsequently discharged on no supplemental oxygen on day 10 of her remdesivir trial this result is in line with other such case reports of compassionate-use remdesivir which while limited in power and uncontrolled have shown that initiation of remdesivir may reduce time to extubation increase the rate of extubation and decrease mortality in covid-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal oxygen therapy 7 randomized controlled trials are ongoing and needed to determine the efficacy of remdesivir in the management of critically ill sars-cov-2 infected patients but this case and other limited case series show promise for remdesivir as a viable therapy for covid-19  remdesivir la esperanza antiviral frente al sars-cov-2 jordi reina   el 31 de diciembre de 2019 se detect en la ciudad de wuhan china un brote neumona de etiologa desconocida que fue rpidamente comunicado a la oms una semana despus el 7 de enero de 2020 se aisl de estos pacientes un nuevo coronavirus designado inicialmente como 2019-ncov 1 2 el 11 de febrero de 2020 la oms estableci el nombre de la enfermedad como covid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 y se design provisionalmente al coronavirus causante como sarscov-2 1-3 el sars-cov-2 es un nuevo virus que pertenece a la subfamilia orthocoronavirinae gnero coronavirus y al subgnero sarbecovirus beta-coronavirus beta-2b y dentro de ellos al clado o linaje 2 que est mucho ms prximo genticamente a los coronavirus de los murcilagos que del sars humano el genoma del sars-cov-2 est formado por un arn de una sola cadena de unos 30000 nucletidos y seis orf open reading frames idnticos al resto de coronavirus y varios genes adicionales la mayora de estos genes slo presentan una homologa del 80 con el antiguo virus sars-cov sin embargo los genes implicados en la replicacin orf1ab presentan una homologa del 94 con este virus 2-4 a pesar de ello la secuenciacin completa de los genomas de los coronavirus detectados en pacientes y especialmente el gen de la arn-polimerasa arndirigida rprd y el gen s espcula externa muestran que las cepas humanas constituyen un linaje distinto del sars-cov pero muy cercano al linaje detectado en algunos murcilagos batcov ratg134 el sars-cov-2 ha infectado en estos momentos muchas ms personas que sus predecesores 95000 varios factores parecen haber favorecido esta rpida expansin por una parte que el epicentro del brote la ciudad de wuhan presenta unos 11 millones de habitantes y es el principal nudo de comunicaciones de la provincia de hubei lo cual facilita los contactos persona-persona y la exportacin de casos a otras ciudades los datos estimados de su ro estn en 2-35 de modo que cada paciente puede infectar a 2  3 personas nuevas este valor es parecido al sars ro 2-5 y mucho mayor que el del mers ro 1 pero el nmero de personas infectadas por nuevo coronavirus por trasmisin interhumana es unas 3-10 veces superior que los virus previos 1-3 la ausencia de un frmaco antiviral de demostrada eficacia frente a los diferentes coronavirus obliga a utilizar diferentes estrategias para optimizar aquellos ya conocidos la primera de ellas sera probar utilizando los ensayos clsicos los antivirales de amplio espectro conocidos que se utilizan para otras infecciones vricas estos mtodos establecen el efecto de este frmaco en las diferentes fases de replicacin viral y formacin de placas en los cultivos celulares como ejemplos de este tipo de frmacos seran los diferentes interferones tipo i ifnalfa beta kappa etc o tipo ii ifn-gamma estos frmacos poseen la ventaja de conocerse de antemano todas sus propiedades farmacocinticas y farmacodinmicas y sus posibles efectos adversos sin embargo ninguno de ellos ha demostrado eficacia ni efecto cuando se administran en solitario sobre los diferentes coronavirus estudiados adems de provocar ciertas reacciones adversas en algunos pacientes 5-9 la segunda metodologa sera la de utilizar la librera mltiple de compuestos qumicos que se conocen y probar algunos de ellos de acuerdo con su frmula qumica a la bsqueda del azar funcional parece evidente que este sistema que ha funcionado para otras patologas no sera demasiado til para obtener un frmaco anti-coronavirus sinttico eficaz en un breve espacio de tiempo 5-7 la tercera posibilidad sera el desarrollo de frmacos especficos basados en el conocimiento y anlisis del genoma y del ciclo replicativo de los diferentes coronavirus 4 5 hasta la fecha se han probado muchos compuestos qumicos capaces de bloquear in vitro esta actividad en los coronavirus sin embargo la mayora de ellos no son eficaces clnicamente por comportar situaciones de inmunosupresin del husped o porque su dosis efectiva es muy superior a la obtenida a nivel plasmtico 4 6 7 frente al sars-cov-2 y de acuerdo con las primeras guas teraputicas chinas los nicos compuestos inicialmente recomendados seran el ifn-alfa 5 millones unidades y la combinacin lopinavirritonavir 400 mg100 mg10 el ifn-alfa es un antiviral de amplio espectro que se ha utilizado para el tratamiento de la hepatitis b por su parte lopinavir es un inhibidor de la proteasa que se emplea para el tratamiento el vih este frmaco por s mismo o en combinacin con ritonavir ha mostrado actividad anti-coronavirus in vitro frente al sars los pacientes tratados con esta combinacin frente al grupo tratado con ribavirina presentaron un menor riesgo de desarrollar distress respiratorio o fallecimiento 1112 otro grupo de antivirales de posible utilidad seran los anlogos de los diferentes nuclesidos que han mostrado capacidad para bloquear la actividad replicativa de diferentes virus tanto adn como arn 13 sin embargo en el grupo de los coronavirus existe una dificultad biolgica frente a estos compuestos que es la sntesis de una 3-5-exoribonucleasa exonn que interacta con ellos e inhibe su actividad 13-15 gracias a este enzima compuestos como el 5-fluorouracilo y la ribavirina carecen de eficacia in vitro por evasin de su capacidad para interferir en la sntesis del nuevo arn viral 13 14 sheahan et al 16 fueron los primeros en 2017 en comunicar que el profrmaco monofosforamidato un anlogo del nuclesido c-adenosina 1-ciano-4-aza-79-dideazaadenosine gs-5734 y gs-441524 posteriormente designado como remdesivir presentaba capacidad para inhibir la infeccin y replicacin del sars-cov mers-cov y de algunas cepas de los bat-cov en cultivos de clulas epiteliales del tracto respiratorio humano 1314 adems remdesivir presentaba eficacia teraputica y profilctica frente al sars-cov en el modelo murino 1317 remdesivir en su forma de trifosfato es un anlogo de la adenosina figura 1 que compite preferentemente por el atp viral y se incorpora como falso nuclesido a la nueva cadena del arn viral determinando una terminacin o interrupcin prematura primeras 2 horas post-infeccin de la sntesis del arn y de la replicacin viral por ello tambin se le considera un inhibidor de la arn-polimerasa viral arn-dirigida rprd 4131618 gordon et al 19 han demostrado in vitro que remdesivir interacta de forma directa con las protenas nsp8 y nsp12 de la rprd del mers-cov siendo esa su diana teraputica adems confirman que los nuclesidos externos aportados en este caso en forma de remdesivir se incorporan mucho ms eficientemente al proceso replicativo viral que los existentes en el propio citoplasma de la clula infectada 16 el estudio de wang et al 20 ha mostrado que la concentracin efectiva-90 ce90 de este antiviral frente al sarscov-2 en cultivo de clulas vero-e6 es de 176 m sugiriendo que esta misma concentracin podra alcanzarse en el ser humano sin dificultad tambin han comprobado como remdesivir inhibe eficientemente la infeccin por el sars-cov-2 en cultivos celulares clulas huh-7 procedentes de cncer heptico humano 1518 remdesivir ha demostrado in vitro capacidad para inhibir la replicacin de un beta-coronavirus animal mouse hepatitis virus interfiriendo con la rprd a pesar de la presencia de la exoribonucleasa 14 este enzima viral nsp14 exonn se encargara de escindir el antiviral y determinar la disminucin de la sensibilidad o resistencia al mismo 16 19 destaca adems que los coronavirus parcialmente resistentes a este antiviral obtenidos in vitro tras 20 pases en presencia del gs-441524 anlogo de remdesivir desarrollan dos mutaciones temporales f476l y v553l en el gen de la rdrp pero permanecen sensibles a concentraciones elevadas del mismo mientras que se observa una disminucin evidente del fitness y de su trasmisibilidad en comparacin con la cepa salvaje del mers-cov 13 este descenso del fitness se debe fundamentalmente a la alteracin en la replicacin del genoma viral escasa fidelidad de copia de la rprd errores en la incorporacin de los nucletidos a la nueva cadena viral y baja estabilidad de las protenas derivadas de estos genomas 1316 estos datos indican que para la obtencin de la mxima actividad antiviral los anlogos de los nuclesidos incluido remdesivir precisan inhibir de forma directa la expresin del gen exonn exoribonucleasa lo cual les permite obtener concentraciones intracelulares ms elevadas 13 a pesar de todo ello parece evidente la elevada capacidad de remdesivir para inhibir de forma directa y eficiente la replicacin del arn de la inmensa mayora de coronavirus incluyendo muy probablemente el nuevo sars-cov-2 13 14 19 los estudios experimentales en animales demuestran que comparado con el grupo control este antiviral reduce de forma significativa la replicacin y la carga viral disminuye el dao pulmonar y esta actividad es mejor que la obtenida con la utilizacin de lopinavirritonavir combinado con ifn-beta en los ratones infectados por el mers-cov 16 21-23 este antiviral ha completado el ensayo clnico fase iii en el tratamiento de la infeccin por el virus bola y se conocen los datos de farmacocintica y seguridad para los humanos 78 en algunos estudios la combinacin de remdesivir  ifn-beta ha mostrado superior a la combinacin lopinavirritonavir frente al merscov tanto in vitro como in vivo 11 12 23 segn comunicaciones de casos aislados la combinacin de remdesivir con sin ifn-beta sera superior a la triple combinacin lopinavir ritonavirifn-beta 11 12 el estudio de de wit et al 22 demuestra la eficacia profilctica de remdesivir en las personas expuestas al mers-cov es-pecialmente el personal sanitario como terapia en esta entidad debera administrarse lo antes posible primeras 48 horas ya que la replicacin viral es mxima al inicio de la sintomatologa y con ello se acortara el tiempo de excrecin del mismo y su transmisibilidad por ello este antiviral podra tener utilidad teraputica en los pacientes infectados por el sars-cov-2 5 6 22 sin embargo en estos momentos los pocos datos de eficacia y actividad antiviral se han realizado slo frente al sars-cov o mers-cov por ello todava se desconoce la eficacia y seguridad de remdesivir en pacientes infectados por el sars-cov-2 sin embargo segn los datos obtenidos hasta el momento remdesivir podra ser la esperanza antiviral frente al sars-cov-2 que se expande

april 25 20201 although most infections are self-limited about 15 of infected adults develop severe pneumonia that requires treatment with supplemental oxygen and an additional 5 progress to critical illness with hypoxaemic respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure that necessitates ventilatory support often for several weeks2 3 4 at least half of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation have died in hospital4 5 and the associated burden on health-care systems especially intensive care units has been overwhelming in several affected countries although several approved drugs and investigational agents have shown antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro6 7 at present there are no antiviral therapies of proven effectiveness in treating severely ill patients with covid-19 a multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial rct of hydroxychloroquine involving 150 adults admitted to hospital for covid-19 reported no significant effect of the drug on accelerating viral clearance8 an rct enrolling patients within 12 days of symptom onset found that favipiravir was superior to arbidol in terms of the clinical recovery rate at day 7 in patients with mild illness 62 56 of 111 with arbidol vs 70 71 of 98 with favipiravir but not in those with critical illness 0 vs 1 69 in severe illness one uncontrolled study of five patients given convalescent plasma suggested a possible benefit although the patients already had detectable anti-sars-cov-2 neutralising antibodies before receipt of the plasma10 an open-label rct of oral lopinavirritonavir found no significant effect on the primary outcome measure of time to clinical improvement and no evidence of reduction in viral rna titres compared to control11 however per-protocol analyses suggested possible reductions in time to clinical improvement difference of 1 day particularly in those treated within 12 days of symptom onset further studies of lopinavirritonavir and other drugs are ongoing 
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed up to april 10 2020 for published clinical trials assessing the effect of remdesivir among patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the search terms used were covid-19 or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 and remdesivir and clinical trial or randomized controlled trial we identified no published clinical trials of the effect of remdesivir in patients with covid-19
added value of this study
our study is the first randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe covid-19 the study was terminated before attaining the prespecified sample size in the intention-to-treat population the primary endpoint of time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between groups but was numerically shorter in the remdesivir group than the control group particularly in those treated within 10 days of symptom onset the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation although also not significantly different between groups was numerically shorter in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients
implications of all the available evidence
no statistically significant benefits were observed for remdesivir treatment beyond those of standard of care treatment our trial did not attain the predetermined sample size because the outbreak of covid-19 was brought under control in china future studies of remdesivir including earlier treatment in patients with covid-19 and higher-dose regimens or in combination with other antivirals or sars-cov-2 neutralising antibodies in those with severe covid-19 are needed to better understand its potential effectiveness
 remdesivir also gs-5734 is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue that has a broad antiviral spectrum including filoviruses paramyxoviruses pneumoviruses and coronaviruses12 13 in vitro remdesivir inhibits all human and animal coronaviruses tested to date including sars-cov-213 14 15 and has shown antiviral and clinical effects in animal models of sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov infections13 16 17 in a lethal murine model of mers remdesivir was superior to a regimen of combined interferon beta and lopinavirritonavir16 remdesivir is a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 replication in human nasal and bronchial airway epithelial cells18 in a non-lethal rhesus macaque model of sars-cov-2 infection early remdesivir administration was shown to exert significant antiviral and clinical effects reduced pulmonary infiltrates and virus titres in bronchoalveolar lavages vs vehicle only19 intravenous remdesivir was studied for treatment of ebola virus disease in which it was adequately tolerated but less effective than several monoclonal antibody therapeutics20 and has been used on the basis of individual compassionate use over the past several months in patients with covid-19 in some countries21 case studies have reported benefit in severely ill patients with covid-195 21 22 however the clinical and antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in covid-19 remains to be established here we report the results of a placebo-controlled randomised trial of remdesivir in patients with severe covid-19 this was an investigator-initiated individually randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous remdesivir in adults aged 18 years admitted to hospital with severe covid-19 the trial was done at ten hospitals in wuhan hubei china ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of each participating hospital written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their

virological measures included the proportions of patients with viral rna detected and viral rna load measured by quantitative rt-pcr safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events serious adverse events and premature discontinuations of study drug the original design required a total of 325 events across both groups which would provide 80 power under a one-sided type i error of 25 if the hazard ratio hr comparing remdesivir to placebo is 14 corresponding to a change in time to clinical improvement of 6 days assuming that time to clinical improvement is 21 days on placebo one interim analysis using triangular boundaries23 and a 21 allocation ratio between remdesivir and placebo had been accounted for in the original design assuming an 80 event rate within 28 days across both groups and a dropout rate of 10 implies that about 453 patients should be recruited for this trial 151 on placebo and 302 on remdesivir the possibility for an interim analysis after enrolment of about 240 patients was included in the design if requested by the independent data safety and monitoring board the primary efficacy analysis was done on an intention-to-treat itt basis with all

were hypoalbuminaemia constipation anaemia hypokalaemia increased aspartate aminotransferase increased blood lipids and increased total bilirubin 28 18 serious adverse events were reported in the remdesivir group and 20 26 were reported in the control group more patients in the remdesivir group than the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events or serious adverse events 18 12 in the remdesivir group vs four 5 in the placebo group among whom seven 5 were due to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome in the remdesivir group all deaths during the observation period were judged by the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention our trial found that intravenous remdesivir did not significantly improve the time to clinical improvement mortality or time to clearance of virus in patients with serious covid-19 compared with placebo compared with a previous study of compassionate use of remdesivir21 our study population was less ill eg at the time of enrolment 04 were on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation vs 64 in the previous study and was treated somewhat earlier in their disease course median 10 days vs 12 days such differences might be expected to favour remdesivir providing greater effects in our study population but our results did not meet this expectation however our study did not reach its target enrolment because the stringent public health measures used in wuhan led to marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-march and restrictions on hospital bed availability resulted in most patients being enrolled later in the course of disease consequently we could not adequately assess whether earlier remdesivir treatment might have provided clinical benefit however among patients who were treated within 10 days of symptom onset remdesivir was not a significant factor but was associated with a numerical reduction of 5 days in median time to clinical improvement ongoing controlled clinical trials are expected to confirm or refute our findings in one murine model of sars remdesivir treatment starting at 2 days after infection after virus replication and lung airway epithelial damage had already peaked significantly reduced sars-cov-1 lung titres but did not decrease disease severity or mortality13 a need for early treatment has been found in non-human primate models of sars and mers in which virus replication is very short-lived and lung pathology appears to develop more rapidly than in human infections17 19 such findings argue for testing of remdesivir earlier in covid-19 remdesivir did not result in significant reductions in sars-cov-2 rna loads or detectability in upper respiratory tract or sputum specimens in this study despite showing strong antiviral effects in preclinical models of infection with coronaviruses in african green monkey kidney vero e6 cells remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 with a 50 effective concentration ec50 of 046 gml and an ec90 of 106 gml6 in human nasal and bronchial airway epithelial cells a fixed 20 m 121 gml concentration reduced estimated intracellular viral titres over 70 log10 50 tissue culture infective dose per ml at 48 h18 in human airway epithelial cells the ec50 for remdesivir was 0042 gml for sars-cov and 0045 gml for mers-cov13 in a murine model of mers subcutaneous remdesivir showed significant antiviral and clinical effects with a dose regimen that maintained plasma concentrations greater than 1 m 060 gml throughout the dosing interval13 in rhesus macaques a 5 mgkg dose reported to be roughly equivalent to 100-mg daily dosing in humans was effective for treatment of mers-cov infection and reduced pulmonary virus replication when started at 12 h after infection18 healthy adult volunteers receiving doses similar to our trial 200 mg on day 1 100 mg on days 24 had mean peak plasma concentrations of 54 gml percentage coefficient of variation 203 on day 1 and 26 gml 127 on day 524 doses of 150 mgday for 14 days have been adequately tolerated in healthy adults and a daily dose regimen of 150 mg for 3 days followed by 225 mg for 11 days appeared to be generally well tolerated in one patient with ebola meningoencephalitis25 however the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in severely ill patients and particularly the concentrations of the active nucleotide metabolite gs-441524 triphosphate in respiratory tract cells of treated patients are unknown studies of higher-dose regimens for which there are safety data eg 150200 mg daily doses warrant consideration in severe covid-19 our study found that remdesivir was adequately tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified the overall proportion of patients with serious adverse events tended to be lower in remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients however a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms anorexia nausea and vomiting aminotransferase or bilirubin increases and worsened cardiopulmonary status limitations of our study include insufficient power to detect assumed differences in clinical outcomes initiation of treatment quite late in covid-19 and the absence of data on infectious virus recovery or on possible emergence of reduced susceptibility to remdesivir of note in non-human primates the inhibitory effects of remdesivir on infectious sars-cov-2 recovery in bronchoalveolar lavages were much greater than in controls but viral rna detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were not consistently decreased versus controls19 coronaviruses partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir about six-times increased ec50 have been obtained after serial in vitro passage but these viruses remain susceptible to higher remdesivir concentrations and show impaired fitness26 the frequent use of corticosteroids in our patient group might have promoted viral replication as observed in sars27 and mers28 although these studies only reported prolongation of the detection of viral rna not infectious virus furthermore we have no answer to whether longer treatment course and higher dose of remdesivir would be beneficial in patients with severe covid-19 in summary we found that this dose regimen of intravenous remdesivir was adequately tolerated but did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with covid-19 however we could not exclude clinically meaningful differences and saw numerical reductions in some clinical parameters ongoing studies with larger sample sizes will continue to inform our understanding of the effect of remdesivir on covid-19 furthermore strategies to enhance the antiviral potency of remdesivir eg higher-dose regimens combination with other antivirals or sars-cov-2 neutralising antibodies and to mitigate immunopathological host responses contributing to covid-19 severity eg inhibitors of il-6 il-1 or tnf require rigorous study in patients with severe covid-19

compounds with therapeutic potential against novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus miguel martinez angel   on 30 december 2019 a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases including 7 severe cases of unknown origin emerged in wuhan hubei china and were reported to the national health commission of china 1 in the early stages of this pneumonia patients developed severe acute respiratory infection symptoms and some patients rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 real-time pcr rt-pcr and deep sequencing analysis of lower respiratory tract samples identified a novel human coronavirus hcov now called sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 35 by the end of january 2020 nearly 50000 confirmed cases were reported in china and the first confirmed cases were reported in thailand nepal republic of korea the united states singapore france vietnam canada australia malaysia germany the united arab emirates uae finland italy cambodia sri lanka the russian federation spain sweden india and the philippines among the patients with confirmed cases most 80 were aged 30 to 80 years and had mild infections the fatality rate was around 2 6 coronaviruses can cause different types of infections in diverse animals in humans they mainly produce respiratory tract infections as observed with sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7 8 sequencing and phylogenetic analyses have shown that the novel sars-cov-2 strain is closely related to a group of human sars-like coronaviruses and bat sars-related coronaviruses 911 the origin of sars-cov-2 remains unclear it is unknown how it was first transmitted to humans the high prevalence of sars-related coronaviruses in bats has suggested that a bat coronavirus might have jumped into a civet or some other mammal and from there to humans which started the former 2003 sars 2003-sars epidemic initial confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 were associated with huanan seafood and live-animal markets however no animal source has been identified to date and spillover events may continue to occur although bats might be the source of sars-cov-2 it is critical to identify the intermediate species to stop the current spread and to prevent future human sars-related coronavirus epidemics a key issue is whether the current sars-cov-2 epidemic is similar to other sars outbreaks or whether it shows different features the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 indicate that this new outbreak is different from the 2003-sars outbreak sars-cov-2 displays higher transmissibility and lower mortality than 2003-sars 1 3 4 sars-cov-2 has shown efficient intrafamilial spread 4 the asymptomatic period of sars-cov-2 infections oscillates between 2 and 14 days and some individuals probably transmit the virus without developing any disease symptoms it remains to be elucidated whether this virus replicates more readily in the upper airway than sars-cov and mers-cov and whether it is similar to other human coronaviruses hcovs that cause colds but not pneumonia it will be necessary to identify molecular determinants that mediate transmission from animal to human and from human to human of note in the novel sars-cov-2 strain the nucleotide sequence of the external ectodomain in the spike protein receptor-binding domain is different from that of the 2003 sars-cov when individual bat coronavirus spike genes were introduced into sars-cov infectious clones the sars-covbat-cov spike viruses could bind to the human bat or civet angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 cellular receptor 12 understanding the interaction between this novel sars-cov-2 spike protein and the host ace2 receptor might reveal how this virus overcame the species barrier between animals and humans as discussed below this information might promote the design of effective antivirals to predict new zoonotic coronavirus jumps across species and to understand the rate of virus spread among people it is crucial to determine whether sars-cov-2 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection as an rna virus sars-cov-2 has intrinsic genetic variability which results in a high mutation rate moreover coronaviruses have the largest genomes 30 kb among rna viruses however part of their sequence encodes a proofreading 3 exonuclease that can increase replication fidelity 13 it has been suggested that any adaptation in the sars-cov-2 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting from person to person might also increase its virulence 14 however this mechanism could lead to a genetic bottleneck known as mullers ratchet which could significantly decrease viral fitness 15 mullers ratchet predicts that when mutation rates are high and a significant proportion of mutations are deleterious a type of irreversible ratchet mechanism gradually reduces the mean fitness of small populations of asexual organisms because genetic bottlenecks for rna viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions the sars-cov-2 is expected to become less virulent through human-to-human transmissions 16 from the public health perspective we urgently need to develop an effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutics to stop the sars-cov-2 epidemic moreover social and economic issues generated by this epidemic also call for rapid interventions this review focuses on the potential of repurposing preexisting compounds that might provide new opportunities for treating people infected with sars-cov-2 previous work with sars-cov and mers-cov has provided an opportunity to accelerate the identification of meaningful therapies for fighting the novel sars-cov-2 epidemic nevertheless we must be aware that currently no compound that targets sars-cov or mers-cov has moved beyond phase 1 trials the most promising antiviral for fighting sars-cov-2 is remdesivir gs-5734 remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against filoviruses paramyxoviruses pneumoviruses and pathogenic coronaviruses like sars-cov and mers-cov 17 pharmacokinetic studies have been completed and clinical trials are ongoing for testing remdesivir efficacy in treating ebola virus 18 previous studies have indicated that nucleotide analogues generally show low efficacy against coronaviruses due to the presence of the virus exonuclease proofreading enzyme nevertheless remdesivir was found to be effective against sars-cov mers-cov and bat cov strains 17 in tissue cultures remdesivir displayed half-maximal effective concentrations ec50s of 0069 m for sars-cov and 0074 m for mers-cov of note tissue culture studies have shown that remdesivir is also active in the submicromolar ec50 range against a number of highly divergent coronaviruses including the endemic human covs oc43 hcov-oc43 and 229e hcov-229e thus remdesivir has broad-spectrum anti-cov activity 19 in a mouse model of sars-cov pathogenesis prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of remdesivir significantly reduced the lung viral load viral titers were reduced by 2 orders of magnitude on day 4 or 5 postinfection remdesivir improved the clinical signs of disease and respiratory function compared to untreated control animals 17 comparable results were obtained with mers-cov in prophylactic studies carried out with a mers-cov mouse transgenic model in that model a humanized mers-cov receptor humanized dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hdpp4 was expressed and carboxylesterase 1c ces1c was deleted to improve the pharmacokinetics of nucleotide prodrugs 20 remdesivir specificity for coronavirus was demonstrated by propagating the virus in tissue culture after 23 passages in the presence of drug two mutations were identified f276l and v553l in the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase gene these mutations increased the replication capacity of the virus in the presence of remdesivir 21 however these amino acid changes decreased the viral fitness and attenuated sars-cov pathogenesis in mice 21 the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment was recently tested in a nonhuman primate rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection 22 when prophylactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to inoculation mers-cov was prevented from inducing clinical disease and inhibited from replicating in respiratory tissues which prevented the formation of lung lesions similar results were obtained when therapeutic remdesivir treatment was initiated at 12 h after virus inoculation 22 human safety data are available for remdesivir 18 thus human trials can be initiated for testing the efficacy of this compound against novel coronaviruses therapies that are approved by the food and drug administration fda have been evaluated for antiviral activity against sars-cov and mers-cov for example lopinavir lpv a human immunodeficiency virus 1 hiv-1 protease inhibitor was combined with ritonavir rtv to increase the lpv half-life the combination of lpv and rtv lpvrtv was shown to be effective against sars-cov in patients and in tissue culture the estimated ec50 in fetal rhesus kidney-4 cells was 4 gml 23 lpvrtv also reduced weight loss clinical scores viral titers and disease progression in marmosets infected with mers-cov 24 nevertheless the antiviral activity of lpv against mers-cov in tissue culture remains controversial no optimal ec50 was found in vero cells 25 but an ec50 of 8 m was reported in huh7 cells 26 clinical observations in animals and humans showed that mers-cov infections were mediated by both virus replication and host inflammatory responses those findings led to explorations of combination therapies that included type i interferon ifn-i and ifn-ii interferon beta ifn- displayed the best efficacy with ec50s of 137 to 17 iuml for reducing mers-cov replication in tissue culture 25 27 similarly to lpvrtv clinical improvements with ifn- were observed in common marmosets infected with mers-cov 24 in the kingdom of south arabia an ongoing randomized control trial the miracle trial was initiated to determine whether the combination of lpvrtv and ifn- could improve clinical outcomes in mers-cov infections 28 importantly another controlled trial was launched in china to test the efficacy of lpvrtv and ifn- 2b in hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 infections clinicaltrials registration no chictr2000029308 the prophylactic and therapeutic properties of remdesivir and lpvrtvifn- were previously compared in a humanized transgenic mouse mers-cov infection model 29 remdesivir improved pulmonary function reduced lung viral loads and ameliorated severe lung pathology in contrast prophylactic lpvrtvifn- reduced viral loads only slightly and did not impact other disease parameters and therapeutic lpvrtvifn- improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology 29 overall these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than lpvrtvifn- for treating mers-cov infections ribavirin a guanosine analogue is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections including respiratory syncytial virus hepatitis c virus and some viral hemorrhagic fevers in most cases ribavirin is combined with ifn ribavirin was first marketed in 1980 for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus in children although promising results were obtained previously with ribavirin and ifn- 2b in a mers-cov rhesus macaque model 30 data have been conflicting on patients with mers-cov infections that were treated with a combination of ribavirin and ifn either ifn- 2a or ifn-1 31 however ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations an undesirable side effect in patients with respiratory disorders this feature reduces its potential as an antiviral against sars-cov-2 work with influenza virus has shown that monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be useful prophylactic and therapeutic tools several antibodies have been shown previously to bind influenza virus hemagglutinin and inhibit virus replication 12 for example human immunoglobulin g1 igg1 monoclonal antibody mhaa4549a binds to a highly conserved epitope on the stalk of influenza a virus hemagglutinin in a phase 2 human influenza a virus challenge study mhaa4549a significantly reduced the clinical symptoms and viral burden relative to placebo 32 another example is vis410 a monoclonal antibody engineered to target all known influenza a virus strains a phase 2a trial showed that vis410 had some clinical benefits 33 current development efforts in monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against coronaviruses are mainly targeting mers-cov in a phase 1 clinical trial a human polyclonal antibody sab-301 which is generated in trans-chromosomic cattle was found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants 34 however therapeutic treatment with human monoclonal antibodies did not protect against the severe disease or the loss of lung function induced by mers-cov in animal models 20 the lack of viral sequence homology among different human coronaviruses suggests that current investigational antibody-based therapeutics will not be effective against novel virus variants nevertheless in considering future treatments for novel coronaviruses immune-based therapies should be not discarded another potential treatment option could be the use of novel coronavirus sera prepared from the blood of patients in convalescence convalescent-phase sera passive immunization is well established for viral infection prophylaxis polyclonal antibody products have been licensed that target cytomegalovirus hepatitis b virus and varicella-zoster virus a meta-analysis of reports on the 1918 influenza a virus h1n1 epidemic concluded that early administration of convalescent blood products reduced the absolute risk of pneumonia-related death from 37 to 16 35 nevertheless the appropriate titer of convalescent-phase sera antibody that is required for therapeutic efficacy against sars-cov-2 remains to be determined moreover additional studies performed with influenza virus have produced controversial results regarding the clinical benefit of administering high titers of anti-influenza immunoglobulins 36 finally it remains unclear whether methods based on the use of a sufficient pool of potential donors are feasible work carried out with mers-cov showed that sera from patients recovering from infections did not contain sufficient antibody titers for therapeutic use 37 another interesting therapeutic alternative that was previously explored with influenza virus was that of targeting cellular components involved in the host inflammatory response to the infection for example the activation of the inflammatory response to an infection can induce a cytokine outburst that results in an acute lung injury an example of a therapy for this type of infection has been targeting of cellular toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 with specific antibodies tlr4 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the pattern recognition receptor prr family the prototype pathogen-associated molecular pattern pamp that tlr4 recognizes is that corresponding to the gram-negative bacterium endotoxin lipopolysaccharide lps tlr4 has been implicated in pathology associated with other infections and with tissue damage caused by noninfectious insults tlr4 activation leads to activation of the nf-b intracellular signaling pathway and to inflammatory cytokine production which in turn activate the innate immune system interestingly tlr4-null mice were highly resistant to infection by the mouse-adapted influenza a virus 38 thus protection against influenza virus infections was achieved by targeting tlr4 with small-molecule antagonists like tak-242 or with anti-tlr4-specific antibodies 39 40 indeed targeting a cellular protein would overcome the drawbacks associated with virus or coronavirus genetic heterogeneity the high mortality rates observed in some emerging respiratory diseases induced by viruses like mers-cov sars-cov and novel influenza a virus strains h5n1 have given rise to the hypothesis that the proinflammatory response might be involved in the disease pathogenesis consequently immunosuppressants eg corticosteroids might be used as an adjunct for treating severe forms of the disease however the therapeutic use of immunosuppressants is not free of controversy to date no conclusive results have been found for the effects of immunosuppressants in severe influenza virus infections 12 furthermore the use of corticosteroids to treat influenza virus has been associated with an increased risk of superinfection prolonged viral replication and an increased risk of death 41 in contrast corticosteroid treatment for mers-cov infections was not significantly associated with mortality although a delay in mers-cov rna clearance was observed 42 further studies should be performed to clarify the potential clinical benefit of prescribing immunosuppressants for coronavirus infections to end this minireview i discuss an interesting potential antiviral strategy the spike protein of sars-cov mediates viral entry into target cells intriguingly cleavage and activation of the sars-cov spike protein by a host cell protease are essential for infectious viral entry 43 this host protease could be a type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 which was shown to cleave and activate sars-cov spike protein in cell cultures therefore tmprss2 is a potential a target for antiviral interventions for example the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits the enzymatic activity of tmprss2 44 recently administration of k11777 a cysteine protease inhibitor in the subnanomolar range was shown to inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov replication in tissue cultures 45 moreover the clinically proven serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate which is active against tmprss2 partially blocked sars-cov-2 spike-driven entry into caco-2 and vero-tmprss2 cells 46 future tissue culture and animal model studies should be conducted to clarify the potential antiviral activity of targeting tmprss2 by the end of february 2020 2 months after the first cases of sars-cov-2 were reported in china several hundreds of new infection cases had been registered mainly in other asian regions and europe this news has strongly suggested that we are in the thick of a sars-cov-2 pandemic social alarm and health authorities have called for the development of therapeutic alternatives for fighting the current and possibly new coronavirus epidemics animal models and clinical studies are urgently needed for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of promising antiviral compounds that target the virus andor the immunopathology involved in the host responses the identification and characterization of novel compounds and therapeutic alternatives will be required to better control this probable pandemic outbreak  comparative antiviral activity of remdesivir and anti-hiv nucleoside analogs against human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e keykavous parang naglaa el-sayed salem assad kazeminy j rakesh tiwari k   human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e is one of the seven known human coronaviruses which include hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 mers-cov sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 hcov-229e is a member of the genus alphacoronavirus which infects humans and bats 1 four of the human coronaviruses hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 are associated with lower respiratory tract infections including bronchiolitis and pneumonia 23 or upper respiratory tract infections characterized by rhinorrhea nasal congestion sore throat sneezing and cough that also may be associated with acute otitis media or asthma exacerbations 4 infection with hcov-229e alone is most frequently associated with asymptomatic or mild disease and sometimes acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 the infection is also detected with other respiratory viruses particularly with the human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv 2 these hcov related infections may also be accompanied by asthma exacerbations or acute otitis media thus exposure to hcov-229e is low-risk for healthy adults the hcov-229e virus is easily accessible for the biosafety level 2 bsl2 laboratory therefore hcov-229e may be a good initial model for the evaluation of antiviral compounds that could have potential applications against other coronaviruses such as sars-cov-2 the coronavirus that causes covid-19 although the final selected compounds are still required to be evaluated against other coronaviruses to confirm their activity as of may 16 2020 according to the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center the human mortality of the covid-19 pandemic infection is 313220 people while 4720197 people have been infected globally currently there are no approved drugs monoclonal antibodies or vaccines to treat or prevent human infections caused by sars-cov-2 the discovery and approval of new compounds take several years therefore several existing drug and potential drug candidates such as remdesivir and other antiviral agents have been considered to be repurposed as covid-19 treatments remdesivir gs-5734 figure 1 was developed by gilead and found to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in animal models 67 remdesivir was also evaluated by gilead for sars-cov-2 in early 2020 it was then used by chinese medical researchers in patients for clinical testing in late january 2020 suggesting a favorable inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 unpublished results since then several clinical trials of remdesivir have been initiated by china and the world health organization who furthermore randomized clinical trials are ongoing or planned to determine the effect on improvements in patient recovery 8 remdesivir is still considered one of the most promising drug candidates for the treatment of covid-19 on may 1 2020 the us food and drug administration fda stated that the potential benefits of remdesivir outweigh its known and potential risks for some patients with severe covid-19 since a nih study demonstrated better recovery times than with placebo 8 the fda issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients with severe disease remdesivir is a phosphoramidite prodrug of an adenine cnucleoside it has a short plasma half-life 039 h and is used in the iv dosage form the compound is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug that is metabolized first to the active triphosphate analog that inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp resulting in diminished viral rna replication 9 there is a sequence identity among the rdrp of coronaviruses for example the rdrp of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share 96 sequence identity therefore drugs targeting viral rdrp proteins of sars-cov are likely to be effective for sars-cov-2 10 remdesivir has been found to have broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity due to its potency against previously reported coronaviruses such as mers-cov hcov-nl63 hcovoc43 and hcov-229e 71112 therefore we assumed that compounds that are active against hcov-229e through interfering with rdrp could also exhibit promising antiviral activity against other coronaviruses such as sars-cov-2 reverse transcriptase is an enzyme in the human immunodeficiency virus hiv and many retroviruses that convert the rna template to dna the enzyme has three enzymatic functions at the same time 1 rna-dependent dna polymerase rdrp 2 rnase h and 3 dna-dependent dna polymerase the rna-dependent dna polymerase is used to synthesize a complementary dna strand to the rna template after the removal of the rna strand from the rnadna hybrid double helix by rnase h the dna-dependent dna polymerase completes double-stranded dna synthesis 13 several nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis have been shown to be anti-hiv agents here we selected five nrtis to be evaluated versue remdesivir against hcov-229e tenofovir tfv 2 figure 1 is a nucleotide analog of deoxyadenosine monophosphate with activity against hiv-1 hiv-2 and hbv 1415 efda 4-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2-deoxyadenosine 3 is a highly promising potent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nrti 1617 currently efda is in clinical development by merck 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine flt alovudine 4 and its fatty acyl ester conjugates have been used as anti-hiv agents 181920 23-dideoxy-3-thiacytidine lamivudine 3tc 6 21 and 23-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3-thiacytidine emtricitabine ftc 8 2223 are commercially available anti-hiv agents we have previously shown that the conjugation of certain fatty acids to the anti-hiv nrtis such as flt 3tc and ftc enhanced activity against x4 r5 cell-associated andor multi-drug resistant virus when compared with their parent nucleosides 24252627 thus the antiviral activity of remdesivir against hcov-229e was compared with selected nrtis and selected fatty acyl conjugates the goal was to determine the antiviral activity and toxicity against hcov-229e in an anti-coronavirus cytoprotection assay the method could be used to select potential compounds rationally for evaluation against sars-cov-2 nine compounds were evaluated against hcov-229e in normal human fibroblast lung cells mrc-5 at six test concentrations the compounds included five nrtis tfv 2 efda 3 flt 4 3tc 6 and ftc 8 and three fatty acyl conjugates of flt 5 3tc 7 and ftc 9 we have previously reported the synthesis and evaluation of fatty acyl conjugates 192024252627 fatty acylation of the parent nucleoside generated enhanced activity against cell-free cell-associated andor multi-drug resistant virus the antiviral efficacy and cellular toxicity data are summarized in table 1 the viral cytopathic effect cpe and cell viability were determined at each test concentration remdesivir exhibited ec50 and tc50 values of 007 m and  20 respectively against hcov-229e meanwhile 5-o-tetradecanoyl ester conjugate of ftc 9 demonstrated an ec50 value of 728 m but showed a very low calculated therapeutic index of 12 due to its cytotoxicity to mrc-5 cells compounds 3 5 and 7 were cytotoxic to mrc-5 cells at tc50 ranging from 454553 m the parent nrtis 4 6 and 8 were not active against hcov-229e at the tested concentrations as representative examples dose-response curves for remdesivir 1 ftc 8 5-o-tetradecanoylftc 9 are shown in figure 2 these data indicate that remdesivir acts as an antiviral agent against hcov-229e while anti-nrtis agents were found to be ineffective this could be due to the unique interaction of remdesivir with rna-dependent rna polymerase in coronaviruses such as hcov-229e while nrtis inhibit reverse transcriptase this enzyme has rna-dependent dna polymerase function nrtis also act as dna synthesis chain terminators the mode of interaction of remdesivir with rna polymerase and the crystal structure of protein-nucleotide have not been published yet the structure of remdesivir is unique as a nucleotide prodrug with the presence of a nitrile group at the 1 position and both 3 and 4-hydroxyl groups leading to strong binding to rna polymerases that differentiates this compound from the other nucleoside analogs represented here the structure of rna-dependent rna polymerase of sars-cov-2 was recently published 28 further structural modification of anti-hiv nucleosides could incorporate some functional groups for binding to rna polymerases and be used for more rationale-based antiviral drug design against coronaviruses furthermore the determination of the crystal structure of remdesivir in terms of its binding with rdrp will provide insights into understanding the critical functional groups for the binding and design of the next generation of nucleoside-based inhibitors with higher binding affinities a series of anti-hiv nucleosides and their fatty acyl derivatives were compared with remdesivir for antiviral activity against hcov-229e in mrc-5 cells among all the compounds remdesivir was found to be potent with an ec50 value of 007 m and a therapeutic index of more than 286 m the 5-o-tetradecanoul ester derivative of ftc showed modest activity with an ec50 value of 82 m in general nrtis did not show comparable activity against hcov-229e compared to remdesivir this work advances scientific knowledge in the area of the testing of antiviral compounds and the activity of anti-hiv drugs against coronaviruses this information could also be used to design compounds that are potentially effective against other coronaviruses such as sars-cov-2 the anti-hiv nucleosides were purchased from euro asia trans continental bombay india the synthesis and evaluation of fatty acyl conjugates were conducted according to the previously reported procedures in our laboratory 192024252627 the compounds were solubilized at 40 mm in 100 dmso immediately before assay set up the test materials were evaluated using a high test concentration of 100 m and five serial

roshanshad mohammad akbari reza  background researchers are working hard to find an effective treatment for the new coronavirus 2019 we performed a comprehensive systematic review to investigate the latest clinical evidence on the treatment efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with covid-19 methods we performed a systematic search of the pubmed embase web of science google scholar and medrxiv for relevant observational and interventional studies measured outcomes were mortality rates improvement rates time to clinical improvement all adverse event rates and severe adverse event rates results 3 rcts and 2 cohorts were included in our study in 2 cohort studies patients received remdesivir for 10 days 2 rcts evaluated 10-day treatment of remdesivir efficacy versus placebo group and the other rct compared its 5-day regimen versus 10-day regimen visual inspection of the forest plots revealed that remdesivir efficacy was not much different in reducing 28-day mortality versus 14-day mortality rates besides 10-day treatment regimen overpowers 5-day treatment and placebo in decreasing time to clinical improvement all adverse event rates did not have significant difference however severe adverse event rate was lower in 5-day remdesivir group compared to 10day and placebo groups conclusion 5-day course of remdesivir therapy in covid-19 patients is probably efficacious and safe and patients without invasive mechanical ventilation benefit the most treatment can be extended to 10 days if satisfactory improvement is not seen by day 5 most benefits from remdesivir therapy take place in the first 14 days of the start of the treatment  since the beginning of the coronavirus disease of 2019 in wuhan it has infected more than 71 million people and caused more than 400000 deaths worldwide 1  the rapid spread of the virus has stricken global health and the economy 2  therefore researchers are working hard to find an effective treatment for the new coronavirus 2019 currently there is no established treatment and supportive care is the only management in these patients 3  many drugs tend to show up in many in vitro drug screens however their clinical effect is still under investigation the medical community is actively trialing repurposed and novel medications to find an effective treatment 4  drugs such as remdesivir have been the subjects of recent studies in this situation remdesivir also known as gs-5734 is an adenosine analog firstly developed against the ebola virus in 2017 5  recent studies showed promising results against the rna coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov 6 7  a study reported its clinical benefits in rhesus macaques infected with sars-cov-2 8  in addition other studies revealed its in vitro efficacy against sars-cov-2 in human cell lines 9  however remdesivir effect does not necessarily translate into in vivo efficacy some studies investigated remdesivir clinical efficacy in human patients however most of them were small groups underpowered and inconclusive on may 1 2020 fda issues emergency use authorization for the administration of remdesivir in covid-19 patients 10  however its efficacy is still controversial among experts therefore it is essential to gather all available clinical studies to provide unified evidence on its efficacy here we performed a comprehensive systematic review to investigate the latest clinical evidence on treatment efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with covid-19 in this study we adhered to the recommendations provided by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma statement 2015 11  we performed a systematic search of the medlinepubmed embase and web of science databases with the mesh and non-mesh terms and the keywords of coronavirus or covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov and gs-5734 or remdesivir on may 29 2020 google scholar and medrxiv were also searched with these keywords manually to retrieve gray literature publication year were limited to 2020 details about search strategy and the keywords are presented in additional file except for the time no other restriction was considered for our search we also looked into the references of the included papers for more relevant studies screening was done independently by ma and ar firstly duplicated retrieved search results were identified and excluded we screened the titles and the abstracts of the papers to exclude irrelevant studies accordingly search results were categorized into three categories including included excluded and unclear then full texts of the retrieved studies were reviewed for final inclusion any disagreement was discussed in our project team original articles comparing treatment efficacy and safety of covid-19 patients with remdesivir and placebo were included also studies evaluating treatment outcomes of covid-19 patients with remdesivir in groups with different duration of treatment or with dissimilar disease severity were included review articles duplicate studies meeting abstracts letters and editorials case reports and case series and studies with no original information about remdesivir therapy were excluded in vitro and animal studies were also excluded authors name study design number of patients inclusion criteria duration of illness before remdesivir therapy arms or subgroups of the patients improvement andor mortality rates viral load changes and adverse events were extracted two authors ar and rr performed literature search screening and inclusion of the studies and data extraction independently and disagreements were discussed with another author mra and resolved we use cochrane risk of bias tool 12 and newcastle-ottawa scale13 for assessing risk of bias of randomized controlled studies and observational studies respectively two authors ar and rr independently assessed the risk of bias with the mentioned tools and ma rechecked it results of the final studies were reported separately in a narrative way measured outcomes were mortality rates time to clinical improvement any adverse events severe adverse events and improvement rates we used review manager 53 to draw forest plots of these outcomes i 2 was considered as the indicator for heterogeneity random effect model was used when i 2 exceeds 50 mantel-haenszel odds ratio or and mean difference md were used for reporting effects of dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively due to the great heterogeneity seen in these forest plots meta-analysis was not possible however forest plots comparing measured outcomes in different subgroups were drawn the day of measuring the outcomes 28-day vs 14-day types of the studies rct vs cohort and design of the control group placebo-control vs 5-day treatment regimen were used for dividing studies in different subgroups median and interquartile range iqr were converted to mean and sd according to the formulas suggested by hozo et al 14  besides iqr of the 10-day arm in goldman study was assumed equal to the 5-day arm due to the near median and first quartile between two arms from 329 records identified through database searching and references lists 21 were selected for assessing full texts after matching with our eligibility criteria 5 studies were chosen for final inclusion figure1the dosage of remdesivir in these five studies was single 200mg intravenous dose in first day followed by once-daily 100mg intravenous dose from second day up to 10 days 15 16 17 18 19  three multicenter randomized clinical trials were included in our study adaptive covid-19 treatment trial actt and a trial in ten hospitals in china were both placebo-controlled and patients that were assigned to test arms received remdesivir and those who were assigned to control arms received intravenous placebo with the same frequency and duration of remdesivir infusions 17 19  however participants in both arms of third trial received remdesivir but for different durations 18 2 cohort studies were also included both of them assessed compassionate use of remdesivir between 2 groups

the preliminary report of actt results of the analysis on 1059 participants with lower respiratory tract involvements of covid-19 were published 17  in this double-blinded study 77 of patients required oxygen administration at enrollment the median time between illness onset and randomization of participants was 9 days iqr 6 to 12 and no significant imbalances found in baseline characteristics of 538 participants in test arm and 521 patients in control arm primary outcome in this trial was time to recovery which defined as time from enrollment to the first day on which patient being discharged or hospitalization extended only for infection-control reasons time to recovery was 11 days in test arm 95 ci 9 to 12 and 15 days in control arm 95 ci 13 to 19 the rate ratio of recovery in 14th day was 132 95 ci 122 to 155 with no significant interaction with baseline clinical status mortality was higher in test arm however the difference was not statistically significant with or without adjustment of baseline illness severity 21 of participants in test arm and 27 in control arm experienced serious adverse events there are a number of considerations that must be taken into account when interpreting these results first the patients were allowed to use other medications along with remdesivir or placebo according to each hospital policy this heterogeneity in medications across different subgroups of patients affects the generalizability of the results thus the observed effects may be due to the combined effects of different medications and remdesivir making the results less generalizable second careful evaluation of the study tables revealed that only 180 out of 541 333 patients in the remdesivir group and 185 out of 522 354 patients in the placebo group received the full 10 doses of complete treatment at the time of data analysis accordingly the results may not be truly reflective of the response that would have been observed in the case of receiving the complete course of therapy lastly this trial is ongoing and preliminary results were published therefore the analyses of safety and efficacy of remdesivir in this study has not been completed yet and this imposes a high risk of bias figure2 in a study on 237 patients with covid-19 pneumonia and concomitant impaired oxygenation the effect of remdesivir on clinical improvement was not statistically significant 19  median time to clinical improvement was 21 days iqr 13 to 28 in test arm compared to 23 days iqr 15 to 28 in control arm and rate of clinical improvement by day 28 was 65 in test arm and 58 in control arm also remdesivir was not associated with a significant increase in negative conversion rate of viral load reduction in nasopharyngeal and sputum samples being compared to placebo researchers in this study calculated a sample size of 453 for 80 event rate within study duration of 28 days and 10 drop out rate however only 237 patients were enrolled all

discontinuation   median day of 50 cumulative incidence of clinical improvement was reported as time to improvement in the study of goldman et al there is a high risk of bias due to baseline characteristics imbalances resulted from inadequate sample size figure2  participants in test arm had more comorbidities more tachypnea and longer duration of illness participants of test arm had more adverse events 66 vs 64 and patients in control arm had more serious adverse events 26 vs 18  an open-label rct demonstrated that a 5-day course of remdesivir 200mg in first day and 100 mg for next 4 days may be sufficient 18 in this trial from 397 covid-19 hospitalized patients who did not require invasive ventilation at enrollment 200 patients received 5-day course of remdesivir and 197 patients received remdesivir for 10 days randomization has taken place but lack of stratification has led to worse baseline clinical status of 10-day arm patients rate of clinical improvement which was defined as an improvement of more than one point on a 7-point ordinal scale by day 14 was 65 in 5-day arm patients and 54 in 10-day arm patients nevertheless rate of clinical improvement clinical recovery discharge or mortality by day 14 were not significantly different between two arms after adjustment of baseline clinical status however it should be stated that among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at day 5 ones assigned to 10-day n41 regime had lower mortality as compared to 5-day n25 regime 17 vs 40 in analysis of drug safety both arms were statistically similar in incidence of adverse events however serious adverse events were more prevalent in 10-day arm patients after adjustment of baseline clinical status interpretation of remdesivir efficacy based on this study is limited by the lack of placebo group in a cohort study grein et al analyzed the available data of 53 patients 15  median duration of illness before remdesivir therapy and median follow up time were 12 iqr 9-15 and 18 days iqr 13-23 respectively of 53 patients 34 needed invasive oxygen support and the other 19 needed noninvasive oxygen support 59 of patients in invasive oxygen support group had improvement in category of oxygen support as compared to 89 in patients in the other group by the end of the follow-up mortality rate was higher in invasive group 18 vs 5 participants in invasive group experienced more adverse events 65 vs 53 for entering this study patients physicians had to apply to receive remdesivir this limits the generalizability of the results besides lack of control group and insufficiency of follow up time are also other sources of bias in this study table3 in the other cohort study of 35 patients median duration of illness before hospitalization and median duration of admission before remdesivir therapy were 7iqr 5-10 and 4iqr 3-5 days respectively 16 mortality all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by

httpsdoiorg1011012020061520131227 doi medrxiv preprint after searching for all the manuscripts evaluating the use of remdesivir in the clinical management of covid-19 3 rcts and 2 cohort studies were identified unfortunately the heterogeneity in study design and definition of clinical outcomes as well as controversial study results make it hard to establish a solid conclusion regarding the clinical efficacy of remdesivir actt reported that remdesivir is useful in reducing the time to recovery in patients with covid-19 pneumonia 17  on the other side wang et al failed to show a significant benefit associated with the use of remdesivir in terms of clinical outcomes 19  goldman study revealed that 5-day and 10-day remdesivir therapy does not have significant differences in the terms of clinical outcomes18 finally it is suggested in 2 cohort studies that the use of remdesivir may improve clinical outcomes although their results must be interpreted carefully considering the lack of a control group and incomplete understanding of the natural course of the virus 15 16  to date beigel et al have published the largest rct evaluating the use of remdesivir in patients with lower respiratory tract involvement 17  large sample size and a well-designed study protocol are the strengths of this study remdesivir group was superior to the placebo group reducing the time to recovery and increasing rate of recovery based on this study remdesivir is safe however patients with severe renal impairments were excluded the report of a rct in 10 hospitals in china demonstrates no benefit in clinical outcomes in using remdesivir for treatment of covid-19 patients with lower respiratory tract involvement 19  however the inability to recruit the predetermined study population resulted in study power reduction from 80 to 58 as wang et al stated in the manuscript furthermore the imbalances in baseline characteristics of remdesivir and placebo groups were also a source of error in this study low study power and higher severity of illness in remdesivir arm both decreases the probability of detecting remdesivir effectiveness for example a separate analysis in a subgroup of patients with less than 10 days from symptom onset to the start of treatment showed lesser time to clinical improvement 152 95 ci 095 to 243and faster rate of sputum viral load reduction in the remdesivir group 00672 mentioned outcomes could be statistically significant if this study had higher power and was able to detect smaller effect as a whole this study was not in favor of using remdesivir to treat covid-19 patients although there was an underestimation toward remdesivir effectiveness goldman et al study showed that 5-day course and 10-day course of remdesivir therapy did not have significant difference 18 patients receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were not enrolled in this study therefore less severe patients were evaluated in this study unlike the 2 other rcts assessing the efficacy of remdesivir is impossible due to the lack of the placebo control group baseline clinical characteristics of the patients in two arms were different because of the absence of stratification after adjustment of baseline imbalances both 5-day and 10day groups showed near outcomes although severe adverse events were more prevalent in the 10day group furthermore in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation after receiving remdesivir for 5 days continuation of therapy for another 5 days was associated with lower mortality rate due to the shortage of remdesivir supply 20 indifference between outcomes of these 2 regimes helps us to treat more severe patients grein et al stated that remdesivir may be useful in treating severe covid-19 patients 15  64 of the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation and the sample was correctly labeled as severe this study showed that clinical improvement in milder cases were higher than that of more severe cases it prompts the need for earlier recognition and initiation of treatment before the disease advances to severe stages however the results may be confounded by several reasons first receiving previous treatment and differences in length of remdesivir therapy may affect the final results second absence of a control group to compare the results with make it difficult to understand whether the reported improvement rate is due to remdesivir or not third authors in this study considered death as a censoring event reanalysis of the data for correcting this error showed that estimated improvement rate by kaplan-meier analysis falls from 84 to 70 lastly by considering 32 patients who are discharged or died by the end of the study as the denominator mortality rate rises from 13 to 22 21 a study of remdesivir therapy in 35 icu and ward patients showed that ward patients benefit more from remdesivir therapy than icu patients and experience fewer adverse events also this study reminds the higher efficacy of remdesivir therapy in less severe patients when we considered mortality as the outcome of interest effectiveness of remdesivir in treating covid-19 patients was higher than its efficacy however this superiority was not observed when improvement rate was chosen as the target outcome besides as mentioned previously remdesivir efficacy in reducing mortality rate and increasing improvement rate by day 28 and day 14 are not much different therefore we suggested that most benefits from remdesivir therapy appear in the first 14 days from the start of the treatment and final conditions of the patients are mostly determined by day 14 also we found that extending remdesivir treatment to 10 days lead to the faster clinical improvement all adverse events rates were not significantly different between 10-day arm 5-day arm and placebo groups however severe adverse events rates were lower in 5-day group compared to 10-day group and the 10-day group showed lower severe adverse events compared to placebo group it is difficult to answer the question regarding the efficacy of using remdesivir in severe covid-19 patients so far there are only 2 studies comparing the efficacy of remdesivir in test arm and placebo control arm and the results of these two studies were controversial beigel et al study results were in favor of using remdesivir while wang et al study could not find significant benefit from remdesivir therapy we think that remdesivir can be considered as a choice especially in patients without invasive mechanical ventilation 17 or in patients with less duration of illness 19  the previous studies revealed that remdesivir is beneficial however the magnitude of this benefit is not large enough to make remdesivir monotherapy as an ultimate treatment further rct studies with similar study designs and large sample sizes evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir as a monotherapy and in combination with other choices should be conducted moreover assessing remdesivir efficacy in patients with different clinical subgroups and duration of symptoms are required for optimizing patient selection our study has three major limitations firstly only five articles were eligible to enter our study at least three of them 15 16 19 did not have enough sample sizes in different clinical subgroups therefore comparing these subgroups regarding the efficacy of remdesivir was not incontrovertible second pooling the data of the original articles was impossible due to heterogeneity in study design and reported outcomes however critical review of the study settings and methods and their associations with the reported results have enable us to compare the differences observed in results of these studies third lack of control arm in 2 cohort studies 15 16 and differences in baseline characteristics between test and control arms in 2 rcts 17 19  made it difficult to suggest a conclusive statement for the efficacy of remdesivir in treating covid-19 based on the current evidence 5-day course of remdesivir therapy in covid-19 patients is probably efficacious and safe remdesivir efficacy differs in different disease severity subgroups and hospitalized patients without invasive mechanical ventilation benefit the most from remdesivir treatment can be extended to 10 days if satisfactory improvement is not achieved by day 5 most benefits from remdesivir therapy take place in the first 14 days and patients conditions usually do not change dramatically in the next 14 days more studies are needed to explore the efficacy of remdesivir monotherapy or combination therapy in different disease severity subgroups all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the

 studies are strongly underway to discover rapidly drug candidates for covid-19 and studies are looking into repurposing drugs that have been used for the treatment of other diseases as of 29 march 2020 there were 209 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrialsgov for covid-19 therapeutic studies and this number is estimated to go over 50013 currently several drugs including remdesivir hydroxychloroquine chloroquine ritonavirlopinavir arbidol and interferon are under randomised controlled trials rcts for efficacy andor safety evaluations in patients with covid-19 in different countries1419 remdesivir gs-5734 is among these investigational drugs and some studies reported promising results19 20 remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue intravenous prodrug developed by gilead sciences an american biopharmaceutical company for treatment of ebola virus during the 2014 ebola outbreak in western africa remdesivir shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against many rna viruses including sars-cov-2 through blocking rna polymerase thereby terminating rna transcription a recent study led by the us national institutes of health nih that involved two groups of six rhesus macaque experiment monkeys with one group treated with remdesivir revealed a significantly lowered covid-19 disease progression due to remdesivir21 according to a recent report of the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc in vitro and cell culture studies demonstrated broad-spectrum activity of remedesivir against coronavirus22 nucleoside analogues such as remedesivir can have multiple mechanisms of action including lethal mutagenesis obligate or non-obligate chain termination and perturbation of natural nucleotide triphosphate pools via inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis23 24 in vitro remdesivir inhibits all human and animal coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 and has shown antiviral and clinical effects in animal models of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov infections2529 remdesivir was among the first treatments used in china as the outbreak emerges and it has been reported as potential treatment options for covid-19 in the usa china and italy14 16 30 following the topline data from the randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial conducted by national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid31 the us food and drug administration fda has issued an emergency use authorisation eua of the antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of patients with covid-1932 although clinical trials31 33 have showed remdesivir as a treatment option for covid-19 results are controversial thus the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis of rcts aims to synthesise existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients with covid-19 we will search medlinepubmed httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed embase httpwwwembasecom the cochrane library httpwwwcochranelibrarycom clinicattrialsgov httpswwwclinicaltrialsgov and google scholar httpsscholargooglecom databases for primary articles published as of 30 june 2020 and we will complete the study by 30 august 2020 we will perform hand search from the reference lists of a key articles to identify eligible rcts and supplement the searching we will include all potential rcts that evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir versus placebo or standard of care in patients with covid-19 with no limitations on the geographical location of studies but published in english language we will do a rigorous search strategy using the key words including 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 remdesivir gs-5734 nucleotide-analogue antiviral agents randomized controlled trials clinical trials and rcts table 1 summarises the search strategy that we will applied in pubmed database while details of this strategy that we will also adapt for other databases searches are described in online supplementary additional file 2 table 1 we will formulate our participants eligibility criteria using picos participants interventions comparison outcomes and study designs description model36

 coronaviruses are a cause of respiratory tract infections in humans 1 a novel coronavirus emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 2 subsequently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 coronavirus disease covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 3 and since march 2020 this outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the world health organisation who 4 fever cough and shortness of breath are the main reported symptoms of covid-19 5 but it also has a concerning case mortality rate among certain populations such as older adults and those with underlying health conditions currently there is a need to identify effective safe treatments for covid-19 as quickly as possible due to the ongoing pandemic one such proposed treatment is remdesivir which is an investigational antiviral medicine with proven activity against rna viruses 6 7 remdesivir was originally developed for treatment of ebola virus disease and results from the phase iii randomised clinical trial for this indication have been published 8 it has been shown to have broad spectrum in-vitro activity against several coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 6 9 10 in-vivo activity against mers-cov in animal models 11 12 and has been made available for patients with covid-19 through compassionate use programmes 13 14 several clinical trials are ongoing to examine the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in covid-19 in humans 1518 most recently remdesivir was granted an emergency use authorisation in covid-19 by the us food and drug administration 19 whilst there is considerable interest in the use of remdesivir for covid-19 there has not been a systematic benefitrisk assessment on the use of remdesivir for covid-19 treatment using a structured descriptive framework a key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefitrisk evaluation which starts with inevitably limited information to meet the urgent unmet public health need worldwide then update the benefitrisk evaluation as more data become available the ongoing monitoring of the benefitrisk balance for remdesivir in covid-19 treatment is strengthened by use of a systematic assessment the benefitrisk action team brat framework facilitates identification and summarisation of the key benefits and risks of a product in a defined disease context within a structured descriptive framework further quantitative assessments can then be applied and conducted according to the availability of relevant data at that time 20 the brat framework was also specifically designed to assist communication with regulatory authorities 21 22 the decision-making process is transparent due to the framework design while any assumptions can be explored further by sensitivity analysis through a quantitative component 20 23 this benefitrisk assessment has been conducted based on publicly available publications to date data-lock april 30 2020 it is however acknowledged that there is extremely limited data available at this timepoint the benefitrisk assessment has been designed to be implemented regardless of the quantity of data available but the intention is that the framework will subsequently be readily available to repeat the assessment as further data arise eg results from new and ongoing clinical trials allowing for rapid decision making the objective of this study was to examine the benefitrisk profile of remdesivir in covid-19 patients compared with standard of care placebo or other treatments the population of interest were patients with severe covid-19 while the exposure of interest was remdesivir the comparators of interest were standard of care placebo or other treatments for covid-19 regardless of importance all potential benefits and risks related to remdesivir were initially identified key benefits and risks were then selected by clinician judgement which were those considered to drive the benefitrisk balance of remdesivir the key benefits and risks were used to construct a value tree ranking benefits and risks in order of considered importance ranking was performed by two clinicians after discussion of the importance of each benefit and risk we searched pubmed google scholar and government agency websites to identify suitable data for inclusion the search strategy for pubmed and google scholar wasremdesivir and coronavirus or covid or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov for government agency websites we searched for any mention of remdesivir on the national institute of health nih us food and drug administration and european medicines agency websites papers were included if they reported quantitative data on effectiveness andor safety of remdesivir and a comparator in patients with severe covid-19 case reports were excluded because they did not provide comparative data results were restricted to english language only abstracts in english language were acceptable where sufficient data was provided and peer-reviewed publications for pubmed and google scholar since 2019 to 30 april 2020 where a control group was included data were extracted for each benefit and risk for both remdesivir and the comparator standard of care placebo or other treatments we also searched clinicaltrialsgov to identify background information for the manuscript and to identify ongoing clinical trials since there are no results currently published on clinicaltrialsgov there were no useable data available for extraction due to paucity of data a fully quantitative assessment was not undertaken however the risks and risk difference per 1000 patients were calculated for each benefit and risk the outcomes identified in the value tree were ranked so that swing weighting can be applied in future assessments the weighted net clinical benefit wncb can subsequently be calculated using these weights if sufficient data on both risks and benefits become available in the future 2325 we would propose using the sutton et al method where benefits have a positive contribution to the wncb and risks have a negative contribution 25 the overall wncb would be considered positive benefit outweighs the risk where wncb is  0 a sensitivity analysis can also be used to examine the robustness of the assigned weights and whether significant changes would alter the benefitrisk profile 22 analysis using wncb was not undertaken at this time due to the limited release of clinical trial data the benefits listed in the value tree represent key clinical endpoints included in clinical trial protocols these have been ranked in order of perceived clinical importance from the clinical endpoint of mortality risk through to the surrogate endpoint of viral clearance many studies have utilised ordinal scales which include a spectrum of the clinical status of the patient the primary endpoint used in the recently published study by wang et al 27 was time to clinical improvement up to day 28 this was defined as the time in days from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status from 1  discharged to 6  death or discharged alive from hospital whichever came first the six-point scale was as follows death  6 hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation  5 hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy  4 hospital admission for oxygen therapy but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation  3 hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy  2 and discharged or having reached discharge criteria  1 the primary endpoint in the multicentre adaptive randomized blinded controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of investigational therapeutics for the treatment of covid-19 in hospitalized adults known as the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid 28 was time to recovery time frame day 1 through day 29 day of recovery was defined as the first day on which the subject satisfied one of the following three categories from the ordinal scale 1 hospitalized not requiring supplemental oxygenno longer requires ongoing medical care 2 not hospitalized limitation on activities andor requiring home oxygen 3 not hospitalized no limitations on activities other key clinical outcomes included duration of ventilation duration of oxygen support and duration of hospital stay in addition to time from randomization to discharge or death surrogate endpoints assessing viral load clearance are likely to be less robust forms of endpoint data and accordingly have been ranked lower in terms of clinical importance as remdesivir is an unapproved medicine in most countries its safety profile has not yet been fully characterised known key risks at the current time have been included in the value tree identified from a variety of sources including recently published clinical trial data in the context of covid-19 27 these have also been ranked according to perceived seriousness cardiovascular outcomes including hypotension and arrhythmias have been documented following the use of remdesivir 8 26 29 however the risk of cardiovascular outcomes with remdesivir remains largely unknown 30 hypotension was reported in one patient in the phase iii study investigating remdesivir in the context of ebola virus disease this patient subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest although the manuscript states that this death could not readily be distinguishable from underlying fulminant ebola virus disease itself 8 cardiac arrest was also reported in a further patient in the remdesivir group reported in the covid-19 study by wang et al 27 multiple organ dysfunction septic shock acute kidney injury and hypotension have also been reported as adverse events amongst patients provided with remdesivir either on a compassionate-use basis or in a clinical trial 26 27 respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome has been cited as an adverse event in patients taking remdesivir 27 31 and as such has been included here although it is acknowledged that this may be related to underlying disease covid-19 rather than to remdesivir elevations in liver transaminases and gastrointestinal events including diarrhoea have also been reported with the use of remdesivir 8 13 26 32 in addition to reports of haemorrhage of the lower gastrointestinal gi tract 27 33 where available clinical trial data relating to any efficacy or safety outcomes included in the value tree for both remdesivir and a comparator group in the context of severe covid-19 were extracted and included in table 2 based on this data summary metrics including risks per 1000 patient years and risk differences are presented in table 3 we identified 68 papers through literature searching from pubmed and 384 papers from google scholar we also identified results from one clinical trial on the niaid website after initial review one paper 27 and results from one clinical trial on the niaid website 28 were included in the final benefitrisk assessment in the wang et al trial the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant 21 vs 23 days hr 123 95 ci 087175 in the niaid trial a statistically significant shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed 11 vs 15 days p  0001 with non-significant reduced mortality risk 8 vs 12 p  0059 other non-significant benefit data were identified from the wang et al trial including invasive ventilation and oxygen use at day 28 1 vs 4 and 12 vs 17 respectively risk data were only available from the wang et al trial which reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir 18 compared with the placebo group 26 however more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo 12 vs 5 a serious adverse event is any event that results in death is life-threatening requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or is a birth defect sample sizes for each outcome were limited to those available in the original studies and may not have adequate power to detect differences in risk between groups especially where the outcomes examined were not the primary outcome of interest the benefitrisk assessment is limited by the availability of data which currently consists of two studies within severe covid-19 the generalisability of these results to other populations is unknown for example application of the wang et al results outside of china 27 however this assessment can be subsequently updated once further data from clinical trials are available in addition given the public health urgency of the covid-19 pandemic it is important to provide a systematic assessment of the benefits and risks of remdesivir treatment with evidence available to date and establish a framework that can be used to rapidly update the assessment once further data become available data quality is not reflected in this benefitrisk assessment though all data was extracted from peer-reviewed manuscripts with the exception of data included from the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial these data were obtained from the niaid website a government agency website and included time to recovery and mortality data safety data have not been published on the website at this time since the full results of this clinical trial were not made available at the time of datalock april 30 2020 a wncb analysis was not undertaken because there was a concern that only including efficacy outcomes from the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial may bias the wncb results it is anticipated that such an analysis can be undertaken in the future when results are made available to provide further evidence on the benefitrisk profile our conclusion is based on a qualitative assessment of the available data and subject to change based on further data availability confirmation of causality was not a requirement for inclusion of data in the brat assessment patients may have been on other concomitant medications or had other medical conditions at the time of remdesivir treatment finally we considered hospitalisation of patients to reflect severe covid-19 but we acknowledge that severity of disease may vary regardless of hospitalisation preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefitrisk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe covid-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation there is limited safety data for remdesivir which should be obtained in further studies the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefitrisk assessment  pharmacological therapeutics targeting rna-dependent rna polymerase proteinase and spike protein from mechanistic studies to clinical trials for covid-19 jiansheng huang wenliang song hui huang quancai sun   since its discovery in december 2019 the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia covid-19 has continued to disseminate with the current case count close to 1214466 cases and more than 67767 deaths according to the world health organization who as of 7 april 2020 12 epidemiological studies suggest that the incubation period was estimated to be 114 days whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 48 days it takes about 37 days for the epidemic to double in the number of infections 3 in addition recent study demonstrated that there was about 5 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 among other patients with mild influenza-like symptom without risk factors 4 these patients had only mild or moderate symptoms so they are still active in the community during infection which promotes the possibility of constant transmission to have a better understanding of respiratory infectious disease transmission for pathogenesis and epidemiological spread of disease a model for respiratory emissions was established and it was found that droplets containing the virus can be as small as 1 micron and a multiphase turbulent gas cloud from a human sneeze exhibited the property to travel great distance 78 m 5 this suggests that the gas cloud with its pathogen payload can span a certain space in a few seconds 5 giving a high rate of community spread there is a need to change the public health policy from containment to mitigation of transmission and determine the extent to which mild disease is contagious in the community particularly among less vulnerable young adults for acquisition of sars-cov-2 infection 4 this study also stresses the importance of close cooperation between clinicians pharmaceutical companies and public health authorities 6 increase of clinical knowledge sharing will facilitate the rapid diagnosis and development of pharmacological approaches for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 78 the constant and rapid spread of novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and its ability to disseminate from human to human has prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia covid-19 respiratory viral infection is a global health concern because the virus is contagious and may cause life-threatening respiratory infection and severe pneumonia in humans 9 currently there are three single strand rna ssrna beta-coronavirus that have been identified including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus middle east respiratory syndrome mers virus and sars-cov-2 9 full-length genome sequence has identified that the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak were almost identical to each other and exhibited about 795 sequence identify to sars-cov 1011 furthermore it is found that sars-cov-2 is 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus which indicates that bats might be the intermediate host of this virus 12there are several symptoms of coronavirus infection such as sore throat running nose cough sneezing fever viral conjunctivitis loss of smell and taste and severe pneumonia 7913141516 it is also very challenging to make an accurate and timely diagnosis and it is not easy to distinguish when diagnosing between coronavirus and the influenza respiratory syndromes without rt-pcr diagnosis assay 171819 the number of deaths from covid-19 is already more than the number of lives lost to sars there is a high rate of infection resulting from viral pneumonia consequent inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards caused by sars-cov-2 812 severe pneumonia secondary infections and cardiovascular events were the major reason for death 1320 the pathological features of one case of death from severe infection with sars-cov-2 was investigated and it was found that the pathological features of covid-19 substantially resembled characteristics observed in sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus infection 212223 recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine efficiently suppressed the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro 24 one case of covid-19 was treated with remdesivir in the united states 25 after successful treatment there was no detectable nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 from serum and oropharyngeal swab specimens and there was no gene mutation after comparing it with the previously reported genome sequence of sars-cov-2 1025 this will be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of covid-19 and discovering new therapies and clinical strategies against the infection  the coronavirus cov family has a large homogeneous spike protein this spike protein s protein is responsible for interacting with the host cells such as the pulmonary and parabronchial epithelial cell and helps the coronavirus get through the epithelial cell membrane 26 in addition the alveolar epithelial cells have abundant expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is targeted by the virus the recognition of ace2 by the s protein of the virus enables the invasion of the coronavirus into the human circulation system 27 recent study demonstrates that ace2 is the sars-cov-2 receptor which is required for cell entry 28 single-strand rna ssrna viruses such as the coronavirus family replicate the virus genomes by taking advantage of host cells for example after coronavirus approaches the ribosome of the epithelial cells or other host cells it uses the ribosome of the host cell to replicate polyproteins the replication and subsequent processes of precursor polyproteins can occur in the epithelial cells 29 after the coronavirus polyproteins are expressed two enzymesspecifically coronavirus main proteinase 3clpro and the papain-like protease plproare thought to be involved in cleaving the polyproteins into smaller products used for replicating new viruses 30 in order to generate the daughter rna genome the coronavirus expresses an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp which is a crucial replicase that catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary rna strand using the virus rna template as shown in figure 1 31  although genome replication and transcription are well known to be regulated by the viral rdrp several host factors have been implicated in this process rna chaperones are usually nonspecific nucleic acid binding proteins which have long disordered structures that promote rna molecules to adjust conformational changes for example coronavirus nucleoproteins n protein have rna chaperone activity and function as an rna chaperone which could help template switching 323334 in addition recent studies demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase 3 gsk3 phosphorylates the n protein of sars-cov and further inhibition of gsk3 can effectively inhibit viral replication in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov 35 furthermore heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 hnrnp a1 is involved in the pre-mrna splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the host cells importantly it has been shown that the nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov had binding ability to human hnrnp a1 with high affinity by using kinetic analyses with a surface plasmon resonance spr approach these studies suggest that hnrnpa1 is able to bind to sars-cov n protein to form a replicationtranscription complex and control viral rna synthesis 36 in addition several virus proteins and host factors are essential for the assembly and release of coronavirus homotypic interaction of m protein serves as the scaffold for the virus assembly and morphogenesis in the infected cells specifically both the interaction between the membrane m and s protein and the interaction between m and n protein promote the recruitment of structural components to the assembly location of host cells 3738 for example both envelope e protein and n proteins are required to be co-expressed with m protein for the formation and release of virus-like particles vlps after transfection of vero e6 cells two crucial structural proteins the m protein and e protein play important roles in the coronavirus assembly in addition the e protein is involved in particle assembly by binding with m and further inducing membrane curvature 39 subsequently coronavirus particles can be budded into the er-golgi intermediate compartment ergic of host cells then trafficked in a smooth-wall vesicle and transported through the secretory pathway for assembly and release by exocytosis 4041 there are two subunits of s protein including the s1 subunit with a receptor-binding domain that engages with the host cell receptor ace2 and the s2 subunit involved in regulating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes 42 the s protein plays important roles in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and leads to t cell responses so it is involved in protective immunity during infection with sars-cov 42 vaccines can be developed to specifically recognize the spike protein for sars and ace2 receptor 42 however mutations of the virus gene and the antibody-dependent enhancement ade effect might affect the efficacy of previously developed biological vaccines or even spur a counterproductive immune response although spike protein sequences in sars-cov-2 and sars exhibit some overlap 434445 although it is of importance to develop vaccines and biological therapeutics to prevent the expansion of the sars-cov-2 a careful evaluation of possible immune complications is required before applying the vaccine to the public therefore it may take several months or a few years to generate effective vaccines to prevent outbreak recent study demonstrates that sars-cov-2 has very similar genome sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov and there is more than 90 sequence similarity in several essential enzymes such as rna-dependent rna polymerase papain-like proteinase plpro 3cl-protease 3cl-pro and spike glycoproteins 31 dissecting the structure of rdrp may provide new insights into the mechanisms of rna replication as shown in figure 2 23 several drug candidates including ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir and favipiravir have been used previously to treat sars or mers and these compounds may have potential in treating patients with sars-cov-2 from this current outbreak 31  researchers have posted the genome sequence information of sars-cov-2 isolated from pneumonia patients on the uscs genome browser 1046 this helps scientists to establish a real-time reverse transcription pcr real time rt-pcr diagnostic assay 47 it is of importance to detect nucleic acids of sars-cov-2 in clinical diagnostics and biotechnology clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr technology a simple and powerful tool was initially developed to edit the genome of mammalian cells development of rapid low-cost and sensitive rna detection may enhance point-of-care virus detection genotyping and disease progression monitoring the rna-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr effector cas13ac2c2 displays an unintentional effect of promiscuous ribonuclease activity along with specific rna gene target recognition recently a crispr-based diagnostic assay that makes use of nucleic acid pre-amplification and crisprcas enzymology targeting either spike gene or orf1ab gene was established to specifically recognize desired rna sequences 48 effective crispr guide rnas grna and isothermal amplification primers can be designed to specifically target spike gene and orf1ab gene in the specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking sherlock assays coronavirus rna can be amplified by using recombinase-mediated polymerase amplification with isothermal primers to boost the sensitivity at 3742 c subsequent cas13a-mediated recognition of nucleic acid of coronavirus then cleaves the fluorescent rna probe to separate a fluorophore from its quencher after cas13ac2c2 finds its target coronavirus rna 49 the cleaved fluorescent products can be readily detected and measured this rapid crispr diagnostic assay can provide specific results in 1 h and will provide timely virus rna detection with super-high sensitivity and the ability of single-base pair mismatch 48 therefore development of rapid and robust diagnostic assay to measure the nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 is crucial for the accurate diagnosis of moderate and severe patients and screening of asymptomatic patients especially under the current serious health care situation currently there is no effective drug for treating covid-19 although there was one case reported as having been treated successfully with compassionate use of remdsivir in the us recent studies have found that small molecules of remdesivir and chloroquine effectively suppress the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro 24 according to comparison of genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with sars sequence the catalytic domains of enzymes such as rdrp are highly conserved in these coronaviruses as shown in figure 3 and figure 4 more importantly it is predictable that the protein sequence of the drug binding pocket of the enzymes is highly conserved 56 therefore these enzymes and spike protein could be very promising drug targets for developing a therapeutic approach for covid-19 as shown in table 1 5758 rdrp also known as nsp12 which catalyzes the synthesis of coronavirus rna is an essential enzyme of the coronaviral replicationtranscription machinery complex recent study revealed the structure of sars-cov-2 full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 using cryo-em 59 excepting the conserved features of the polymerase component of the viral polymerase family and key domains for the coronavirus replication shown in rdrp sars-cov-2 nsp12 has a newly featured -hairpin domain at the n-terminal pdb 6m71 as shown in figure 4 further comparative analysis has shown how remdesivir binds to the binding pocket of rdrp of sars-cov-2 59 this structure provides new insight into the key enzyme of the coronaviral replicationtranscription complex and lays a solid foundation for the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting rdrp of sars-cov-2  remdesivir gs-5734 gilead was initially developed to examine its effect on inhibition of ebola virus ebov replication 60 rdrp can incorporate remdesivir which resembles an rna building block atp into new rna strands after binding of remdesivir rdrp stops being able to incorporate rna subunits this puts a stop to the coronavirus genome replication enzyme kinetics demonstrated that ebov rdrp incorporated atp and remdesivir-tp with comparable efficiencies the selectivity of atp for ebov rdrp is four times against remdesivir-tp in comparison purified human mitochondrial rna polymerase h-mtrnap effectively distinguished against remdesivir-tp with a selectivity value of about 500-fold 60  remdesivir has been recently developed as a potential antiviral drug candidate against a wide array of rna virus such as sars-cov and mers-cov5 infections in both in vitro cell experiment and preclinical studies with mice and nonhuman primate nhp models 61 recent study examined the efficacy of the broad-acting antiviral remdesivir in the rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection interestingly it was found that administration of remdesivir initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely restrained mers-covcaused respiratory disease remarkably suppressed mers-cov virus replication in the respiratory system and abolished the progression of lung lesions 62 these results demonstrated that remdesivir was a potential antiviral therapeutic against mers and its efficacy could be further examined in clinical trials subsequently recent study has tested the efficacy of remdesivir on inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication in vitro 24 vero e6 cells were infected with sars-cov-2 different doses of the indicated antivirals were added to treat cells for 48 h the viral yield from the cell supernatant was then detected by qrt-pcr it is worth noting that two compounds remdesivir significantly abolished virus infection at high affinity 24 this also suggests the possibility that remdesivir has efficacy for related coronaviruses such as the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 62 more importantly administration to patients with covid-19 of remdesivir has been shown to be effective in treating one patient for the purpose of compassionate use in the us and there was no adverse event observed in association with infusion of remdesivir  due to the covid-19 pandemic and global health concern it is urgent to develop effective broad-spectrum virus replication inhibitors to manage patients with covid-19 drug targets among coronaviruses include the main protease 3clpro and papain-like proteaseplpro these proteinase play essential roles in processing polyproteins and viral replication the structures of the unliganded sars-cov-2 mpro and its complex with an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor have been recently revealed 52 comparison of genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with sars sequence indicates that the catalytic domains of proteinase are highly conserved in these coronaviruses therefore it is plausible to repurpose the compound library for treatment of sars-cov for developing potential therapeutics for sars-cov-2 computational analysis was also used to screen the effective and potent cysteine protease inhibitors for malaria and sars infection 636465 recently a series of n-tert-butyl-2-n-arylamido-2-pyridin-3-yl acetamides ml188 were identified as potent noncovalent small molecule inhibitors targeting sars-cov 3cl protease 6667 in addition the analogues of keto-glutamine were developed as potent inhibitors for treatment of sars infection 6869 furthermore recent study has shown that compounds containing electrophilic arylketone moiety were designed and synthesized as new sars-cov 3cl protease inhibitors 70 the anilide derived from 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline l-phenylalanine and 4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the sars-cov 3cl protease with ki  003 um by using a fluorogenic tetradecapeptide substrate 7071 it is demonstrated that trioxa-adamantane-triols tats bn ibnca vanba eubn trivially termed bananins were identified to be effective inhibitors of sars-cov nsp10nsp13 rnadna helicasentpase protein atpase enzymatic function bananin bn effectively suppresses both sars-cov rnadna helicase nucleic acid unwinding function and sars-cov rna-viral replication in cell culture 72 in addition high-throughput screening hts approaches were used to screen potent inhibitors of the sars-cov main proteinase 7374 recent computational studies found that lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir are able to bind with sars-cov-2 protease 75 potential therapeutic options targeting the main protease 3clpro were identified for sars-cov-2 including covalent drugs approved or clinically tested there were at least six hits among the total of 11 potential hits identified by using the scar protocol 76 therefore it will be intriguing to determine whether these compounds might be effective for inhibiting the activity of proteinase of sars-cov-2 in vitro and reducing the replication of the virus in treating novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection  no therapies specific or effective for human coronavirus sars-cov-2 have been approved by food and drug administration fda -d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 was initially synthesized as an orally bioavailable ribonucleoside analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various rna viruses such as ebola 77 recent study discovered that nhc effectively inhibited mers-cov and newly emerging sars-cov-2 replication using antiviral assays in the human lung epithelial cell line calu-3 2b4 calu3 cells 78 nhc has shown potent antiviral activity with an average half-maximum effective concentration ic50 of 015 m for cells with a recombinant mers-cov expressing nanoluciferase mers-nluc and there is no observed cytotoxicity in addition nhc was potently antiviral with an ic50 of 03 m and cc50 of 10 m when using a clinically isolated strain of sars-cov2 infected african green monkey kidney vero cells 78 furthermore nhc is highly effective for preventing the virus replication of sars-cov-2 mers-cov as well as sars-cov infection in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures 78 more importantly nhc inhibited the replication of remdesivir rdv-resistant virus and multiple distinct zoonotic cov 77 eidd-2801 an orally bioavailable prodrug of nhc -d-n4-hydroxycytidine-5-isopropyl ester designed for improved in vivo pharmacokinetics remarkably reduced sars-cov replication and pathogenesis significantly decreased mers-cov infectious titers and reduced viral rna and pathogenesis under both prophylactic and early therapeutic conditions in mice 78 these studies indicate that eidd-2801 could not only provide effective treatment of sars-cov-2 infection but also enable the prevention of the spread of sars-cov-2 and control future outbreaks of other emerging coronaviruses it is worth noting that animal experiments and human clinical trials are needed to examine its efficacy for treatment of covid-19 under the current outbreak of covid-19 it is necessary to repurpose natural products to manage patients with covid-19 recent studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can improve the outcomes of covid-19 patients in small clinical trials although it should be used with caution on humans due to its toxicity there are a large number of natural products with known safety profiles such as isoflavones and artemisinin recent study has shown that several isoflavones and related flavonoid compounds have potent antiviral properties in this regards natural products that have been repurposed for broad-spectrum anti-viral therapy can offer safe and inexpensive platforms for discovery of efficient and novel agents for treatment of sars-cov-2 it will be of significance if these fda-approved drugs could be repurposed for treatment of covid-19  recent studies found that naturally occurring flavonoids exhibit a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects against rna virus such as polio-virus type 1 parainfluenza virus type 3 pf-3 and respiratory syncytial virus rsv by inhibiting their replication 79 computational drug design methods were used to identify chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors from fda approved natural and drug-like compounds 80 it has been shown that two natural compounds including flavone and coumarine derivatives were identified as promising hits of proteinase inhibitors of sars-cov-2 80 in addition recent study has shown that hydroxychloroquine an anti-malarial drug significantly abolished sars-cov-2 infection 77 consistent with this hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment improved the outcomes of covid-19 patients in a small clinical study although it should be cautious due to its adverse effects 81 quinine bark was one of the most extensively used therapeutic approached for malaria during the mid-1800s which provides evidence that chemical compounds from natural products can be used successfully to treat an infectious disease 8283 in addition 36 alkaloids alcohol extracts and chloroquine are effective in blocking the polymerization process in parasites one of the main derivatives of quinine mefloquine was discovered to suppress the uptake of chloroquine in infected cells by blocking ingestion of hemoglobin to prevent parasite infection 8283 previous study demonstrated that chloroquine inhibited the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in vitro 84 because there is no effective treatment of covid-19 the extensive outbreak of constant human to human transmission prompts us to apply broad-spectrum anti-viral natural products to prevent or improve the condition of patients with sars-cov-2 4385  recent study revealed that the protein sequence of the drug binding pocket of the enzymes is highly homogeneous between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 86 much progress has been made in the application of natural products and the development of novel therapy for sars infection 87888990 for example a new type of effective inhibitor was identified for inhibition of sars-cov proteinase by using substrate specificity profiling 729192 in addition to chloroquine an anti-malaria natural product artemisinin has anti-viral activity although the mechanism of artemisinin to in inhibiting virus infection is unknown 939495 natural products tordylium persicum boiss  hausskn extract have also been identified for treatment of hiv 96 consistent with this cuscuta campestris crude extracts have been demonstrated to be effective for inhibition of hiv replication 97 cell-based screening assay has been developed to screen virus-specific and broad-spectrum inhibitors for treatment of coronavirus infection 9899100 therefore it is necessary to examine the efficacy of artemisinin and other natural products on covid-19 replication and infection another study has shown that the administration of hydroxychloroquine reduced the morbidity of covid-19 pneumonia 101102103 chloroquine in clinical trials with a large number of patients will be further examined for treatment of covid-19 104 some traditional chinese medicines such as polygonum cuspidatum that may consist of components with efficacy against covid-19 have been examined in clinical trials 105 the pro-inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid aa and eicosapentaenoic acid epa such as leukotrienes and thromboxanes promote inflammation whereas lipoxins resolvins protectins and maresins derived from aa epa and dha facilitate wound healing promote phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load 106 it is implicated that these unsaturated fatty acids and pro-inflammatory metabolites may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds it is intriguing to determine the efficacy of the metabolites on prevention of sars-cov-2 infection 107 in addition using structure-based drug selection for identification of sars-cov-2 protease inhibitors old drugs such as macrolides were predicted to be effective against covid-19 108 therefore treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs may be promising and provide the possibility of a new strategy to fight this emerging sars-cov-2 infection revealing the structural-functional relationships of the s protein of sars-cov-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between s protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 to develop novel therapeutic approaches for coronavirus more studies are focused on investigating the mechanism of coronavirus invasion into host cells similar to sarscov and mers-cov the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is armed with a large spike protein which is used to interact with host cells and then gain entry through the cell membrane 109110 recent study has discovered the structure of mers-cov spike glycoprotein in complex with sialoside attachment receptors pdb 4kr0 111 mers-cov spike glycoprotein is composed of an n-terminal s1 subunit which is assembled as four domains ad and controls attachment to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 dpp4 the host receptor and a c-terminal s2 subunit that combines the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection as shown in figure 5 111 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is required for coronavirus invasion into host cells the viral spike glycoprotein utilizes ace2 as a host protein receptor and mediates merging of the viral and host membranes this allows viral entry into host epithelial cells and host species tropism 112 given that the structure of s protein pdb id6vsb of sars-cov-2 is revealed 3086 more computational analysis and virtual screening could be performed to identify the potential inhibitors of s protein and ace2 interaction as shown in figure 6 in addition recent study has shown that s-phase kinase-associated protein 2 skp2 is necessary for lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of beclin 1 leading to its proteasomal degradation suppression of skp2 promotes autophagy and decreases mers coronavirus replication 113 recent study demonstrate that sars-cov-2 uses the sars-cov receptor ace2 for invasion and the transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 for s protein priming 28 a clinically proven protease inhibitor camostat mesylate has been demonstrated to inhibit calu-3 infection with sars-cov-2 and prevent sars-2-spike protein s protein-mediated entry into primary human lung cells 28 in addition recent study demonstrated that a neutralizing antibody cr3022 targets a highly conserved epitope distal from the receptor-binding site that enables cross-reactive binding between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the structure of cr3022 in complex with the receptor-binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike s protein has been revealed the modeling study further proved that the binding epitope can only be targeted by cr3022 when the conformational changes with two rbd on the trimeric s protein are in the up orientation this provides a molecular mechanism in the binding of the antibody with s protein of sars-cov-2 114 in line with this result recent study demonstrates a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion and inhibited sars-cov-2 infection 115 the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus invasion into host cells will provide new insights into the development of therapeutic approaches for covid-19 by targeting spike proteins and ace2 116117118  because there is no specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 infection the widely investigated small molecule compound remdesvir could be a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in sars-cov and mers-cov infections remdesivir is a 1-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that can be metabolized into its active form to exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against coronavirus as shown in figure 7 a phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to examine the efficacy of remdsivir in adult patients with mildmoderate covid-19 respiratory disease the inclusion criteria include 1 laboratory rt-pcr confirmed patients infected with sars-cov-2 2 lung involvement confirmed with ct imaging the exclusion criteria include patients with sao2spo294 in room air condition severe liver disease and severe renal impairment and patients with any experimental treatment for covid-19 off-label compassionate use or trial related 308 participants have been recruited and the clinical trial outcome will be released at the end of april 2020 there are no therapeutics proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by sars-cov-2 so a phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to examine the efficacy of remdsivir in adult patients with severe covid-19 respiratory disease the clinical trial is sponsored by capital medical university and china-japan friendship hospital the inclusion criteria include 1 confirmation of covid-19 by using laboratory rt-pcr 2 less than 12 days since symptom 3 lung involvement confirmed with ct chest imaging 4 patients with a sao2spo2  94 in room air condition the exclusion criteria include severe liver disease and severe renal impairment and patients with any experimental treatment for covid-19 off-label compassionate use or trial related 452 participants will be recruited and the clinical trial outcome will be released in may 2020 in adults presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards from covid-19 invasive mechanical ventilation a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy and intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents nmba to facilitate protective lung ventilation are necessary for supporting treatment 120 for severe ards cases the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide is recommended 120 a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigation of antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with covid-19 has also initiated at the university of nebraska medical center unmc in omaha these clinical trials will be of significance for therapy involving severe cases of covid-19 after completion of examining the efficacy of remdesivir to treat covid-19  recent studies have shown that sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells which provides the rationale that supporting treatment on lung should be emphasized 121 the expression of ace2 can be upregulated by smoking in humans 122 therefore smoking status should be included for information of identified cases of covid-19 in addition it is crucial to manage patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as long qt syndrome and short qt syndrome in the setting of the covid-19 pandemic 123 patients with inherited arrhythmia may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic factors of covid-19 such as use of antiviral drugs fever stress and electrolyte imbalance 123124 the current studies on potential therapeutic agents such as lopinavirritonavir favipiravir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine interferon ribavirin tocilizumab and sarilumab are important for management of covid-19 51125 more clinical trials are being conducted for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating covid-19 126 several host factors regulate the replication of coronavirus and induce dramatic changes in the host cellular structure and function simultaneously induction of critical signaling proteins is crucial for the pathogenesis of cov and is also involved in the activation of the innate immune response during cov infection neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to sites of viral infection recent studies demonstrate that excessive recruitment of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps results in acute lung injury of influenza pneumonitis 127 in addition neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase mpo serves as a potent tissue damage factor and also contributes to influenza pneumonia in mice infected with influenza virus 128129130131 in addition coronavirus infection is able to induce stress response autophagy apoptosis and activate innate immunity 40 host cell apoptosis caused by cov infection has been extensively studied for example sars-cov and mers-cov infect and induce apoptosis in a variety of tissues including lung spleen thyroid tissues and a variety of cell types such as respiratory epithelial cells neuronal cells primary t lymphocytes and dendritic cells 132133 in addition overexpression of sars-cov s was shown to induce a potent er stress response and the re-arrangement of dmv production and membrane alteration for the assembly of the virus may contribute to endoplasmic reticulum er stress during cov infection 40 unfolded protein response upr -mediated signaling pathway was induced to maintain er homeostasis 134135 the ire1 branch of upr promotes cell survival during cov infection and cov infection activates jnk to modulate apoptosis induction 136137 induction of cell apoptosis provided the possible explanations for the fact that lymphopenia was observed in some patients with cov infection such as sars-cov and sars-cov-2 immune cell apoptosis may lead to the suppression of host immune response and promote the occurring of ards coronavirus infection promotes the activation of inflammasome in host cells and activates innate immunity 138139 in macrophages orf8b provides a potent signal 2 required for activation of inflammasome and activates the nlrp3 nod- lrr- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 to form the inflammasome complex specifically orf8b is able to interact directly with the leucine rich repeat lrr domain of nlrp3 and bind with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card asc in cytosolic dot-like structures 140 orf8b induces cell apoptosis and pyroptotic cell death in macrophages while in those cells lacking nlrp3 accumulating orf8b cytosolic substances lead to mitochondrial dysfunction activation of inflammasome and caspase-independent cell death 140141 recent genome-wide and transcriptome-wide complementary network analysis of sars-cov-2human interaction provided a new network of host proteins affected by the sars-cov-2 infection 141 it has been shown that ace2 is downregulated in the presence of viral infection therefore application of recombinant ace2 has been shown to be effective in treating severe pulmonary infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome 142 recent studies demonstrate that soluble forms of ace2 are beneficial to sars patients due to its competitive binders of sars-cov spike proteins preventing binding to the host cell ace2 143 recent study indicate that there is a substantial number of undocumented infections and this facilitates the rapid dissemination of sars-cov2 144 these findings explain the rapid geographic spread of sars-cov2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging it is also informative to help understand the potential for infection by non-symptomatic subjects therefore one of the most important strategies of management of covid-19 infection is to effectively reduce the possibility of constant human-to-human viral transmission 145 keeping social distancing contact tracing and quarantine are necessary for preventing substantial human to human transmission of covid-19 146147148 recent study demonstrated that the affinity of the sars-cov-2 s protein with ace2 was 10- to 20-fold higher than the sars-cov s protein as shown in figure 5 30 which explains the observations of rapid transmission from human-to-human in covid-19 infection genetic analyses of hundreds of sars-cov-2 genomes revealed that there were two major types l type and s type 149 it seems that the l type 70 was more dominant than the s type 30 the l type was more common in the early stages of the outbreak in china artificial intervention may have put selective pressure on the l type which might be more susceptible to mutate and spread more widely 149 it is very challenging to makes an effective vaccine because of the rapid mutation of ssrna and the antibody-dependent enhancement ade effect 149 therefore it is urgent to develop effective medicine for treatment of moderate and severe patients with low spo2 remdsivir may be potentially developed for treatment of covid-19 after completing the phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to examine its efficacy in patients with covid-19 in addition better understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus invasion into host cells could accelerate discovery of new inhibitors of interaction of spike glycoproteins and ace2 and promote the development of therapeutic approaches for covid-19 finally by drawing lessons from mechanisms of replication of sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase development of potent and effective rdrp inhibitors will provide new insights required for putting rdrp targeted therapeutics into full gear   evaluating the potential of different inhibitors on rna-dependent rna polymerase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 a molecular modeling approach shuvasish choudhury debojyoti moulick purbajyoti saikia muhammed mazumder khairujjaman   a novel coronavirus emerging from wuhan in china in december 2019 has now spread to over 213 countriesterritories across the globe httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 the virus originally named 2019-ncov has now been renamed by taxonomists as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 owing to its genomic and structural similarities with the earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov1 2 3 the disease caused by this virus has been named by the world health organizationas coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and the outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11th march 2020 as of april 27 2020 the virus has affected over 2883603 people and killed more than 198842 and the figures are increasing rapidly today the covid-19 pandemic has become the largest global health crisis a burden on healthcare systems and is affecting global trade and economy so far there exists no specific drug or vaccine for the treatment of covid-19 because de novo drug discovery is a time-consuming venture researchers have suggested drug repurposing as a strategy to find a therapeutic against the virus the approved drugs against other viruses including the similar sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov human immunodeficiency virus hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv have been suggested for further evaluation and clinical studies1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 in addition the knowledge gained through studies of these related viruses has been vital in designing therapeutics against sars-cov-2 structural biology approaches have deciphered the structures of different proteinsenzymes of the sars-cov-2 and at least three of them such as rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp papain-like protease and the main protease are important drug targets5

6 rdrp is the key enzyme which replicates the viral rna genome and is thus the most promising drug target the rdrp of the sars-cov-2 shares 96 sequee identity with the sars-cov9 and thus the compounds or drugs effective against the rdrp of sars-cov are surmised to be effective against the novel cov as well this makes the rdrp the most important therapeutic target against sar-cov-2 recent studies have suggested several known rdrp-inhibiting antivirals other fda-approved drugs and phytochemicals for repurposing against sars-cov-2 using molecular docking studies7 some of the commonly repurposed drugs include ritonavirlopinavir remdesivir hydroxychloroquine ribavirin and so on in view of the previously mentioned fact the present study investigates the relative efficacy of the known rdrp inhibitors as well as other drugscompounds which have been predicted to have rdrp-inhibiting potential using computational modeling the drug target for the present study is rdrp of sars-cov-2 the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme in complex with cofactors was obtained from the research collaboratory for structural bioinformatics rcsb protein data bank wwwrcsborgpdb bearing pdb id 6m71 the structure was determined using electron microscopy at resolution of 290  by gao et al10 and deposited to the database on march 16 2020 the structure bears three non-structured proteins nsps such as one nsp7 and two nsp8 as cofactors the chain a is the nsp12 which is the rdrp and it contains 851 amino acids the structure was downloaded from the database in pdb format thirty compounds were selected from the available literature as test drugs the list includes known rdrp inhibitors as well as other drugscompounds which have been predicted to inhibit the drug target table 1
 the three-dimensional conformers of the compounds were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi pubchem compounds database wwwpubchemncbinlmnihgov and were downloaded in sdf format molecular docking is a powerful computational modeling tool which determines the affinity of binding of any compound with the active site of a receptorenzyme the molecular docking also determines the orientation of binding of the compound at the active site of the enzyme the amount of energy thus liberated which is a negative value determines the stability of the ligandreceptor complex and is referred to as a docking score a compound with a higher ie more negative docking score forms a more stable ligandprotein complex and is surmised to be a better inhibitor11

12 furthermore when a compound shows higher affinity for the active site of an enzyme compared with the natural substrate it interferes with the activity of the enzyme and may bring about competitive inhibition in the present study the molecular docking was performed using molegro virtual docker software 60 mvd following standard procedures11

12 mvd is one of the most widely used and powerful tools in determining ligandprotein interactions and has higher accuracy 87 than many other similar tools13
 briefly the structure of the enzyme was loaded into the software with all the cofactors this was followed by addition of the structures of the test compounds into the workspace docking was performed between the ligands and the active site of the receptorenzyme with grid resolution of 030  moldock scoring function and including amino acids within a radius of 20  around x 12274 y 10669 z 15525 as the active site residues once the docking scores were obtained the best pose in terms of the rerank score for each compound was retained and the binding geometry or conformation was assessed while performing docking incorporation of remdesivir as a test ligand for the present study has two implications first it was included to see its relative affinity compared with the other compounds for the active site of the enzyme and thereby predict its relative efficacy as an inhibitor of rdrp of sars-cov-2 second the drug being a nucleoside analog interacts at the active site of the enzyme and thus serves as a reference ligand in the present study all the test compounds except cortisone were found to interact at the same active site or binding pocket fig 1
a as that of the remdesivir fig 1b this demonstrates that all the compounds have the potential to interact at the same active site of the enzyme and may interfere with the activity of the enzyme binding or interaction of the ligands at the active site of an enzyme implicates that the ligands would interfere with the activity of the enzyme thereby bringing about inhibition of the enzyme the free energy of binding or the docking score implicates the efficacy with which the inhibition is affected chlorhexidine was found to have the highest affinity among all the studied compounds for the active site of rdrp followed by remdesivir novobiocin ceftibuten and ribavirin table 1 the docking score of chlorhexidine 13285 was found to be 116-fold higher than that of remdesivir 11447 while the hydrogen bond score of chlorhexidine 7996 was found to be 142-fold higher than that of remdesivir 5644 furthermore the docking score of remdesivir was found to be 104-fold 111-fold and 113-fold higher than that of novobiocin ceftibuten and ribavirin respectively table 1 among all the compounds cortisone was found to have a positive rerank score this indicates that the compound may not be able to interact with and inhibit the rdrp using molecular docking studies researchers have identified several known and novel compounds as inhibitors of different drug targets of the sars-cov-2 for the viruses using rdrp for replication of their genetic material rna including covs and hiv inhibition of rdrp is one of the most crucial therapeutic strategies which is primarily affected by nucleoside analogs the rdrp of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have 97 sequence identity while the active site of the rdrp of most covs and rna viruses is highly conserved5 this has been the basis for drug repurposing against sars-cov-2 using those compounds which are known to inhibit the rdrp of related viruses the present study reveals that remdesivir has the highest potential in binding and therefore competitively inhibiting rdrp of sars-cov-2 among all known rdrp inhibitors table 1 the inhibitory potential of the same on the rdrp has also been reported from other molecular modeling studies7

14 remdesivir is an adenosine analog and its incorporation into the growing viral rna leads to termination of the rna replication high affinity of the compound for the active site of rdrp of the sars-cov-2 indicates that the compound would compete with the natural substrates ribonucleotides of the rdrp and get incorporated into the growing rna chain remdesivir has been suggested by several researchers for use in patients with covid-19 to reduce viral load1 2 3 4 5 6 7 the compound has already been reported to inhibit replication of the virus in vitro in vero e6 cells15 remdesivir has earlier been reported to inhibit a spectrum of human rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov marburg virus hendra virus nipah virus ebola virus and hiv2

16 17 18 19 20 21 remdesivir was used for successful treatment of the first covid-19 case of the us22 a large number of clinical trials are going on in different countries to evaluate the effectiveness of this compound in patients with covid-19 in the present study chlorhexidine has been found to have highest affinity for the active site of the rdrp of sars-cov-2 table 1 fig 1c the compound was found to bind to the same active site of the rdrp and is therefore predicted to be a promising inhibitor nevertheless the mode of inhibition of this compound would be different from that of nucleoside analogs such as remdesivir this is because nucleoside analogs mimic the natural substrates of rdrp and act as chain terminators unlike chlorhexidine chlorhexidine can not mimic natural substrates of rdrp and will not be incorporated into the viral rna rather it may block the active site of the enzyme and thereby inhibit the entry of the substrates ie nucleotides at the site this will prevent activity of rdrp thereby preventing replication of the viral genome rather than terminating it this compound has also been predicted by wu et al7 as an inhibitor of rdrp using molecular docking approaches chlorhexidine is one of the most widely used drugs against dental plaques gingivitis pharyngitis candidiasis and tonsillitis23 it is a bactericidal fungicidal and virucidal agent and is known to alter membrane potential24 and inhibit atpase25 at concentrations ranging from 0001 to 2 the drug is known to inhibit a wide range of viruses and for coronaviruses it shows effectiveness at a concentration of 00123 however the concentration at which the drug can inhibit rdrp of sars-cov-2 remains to be determined while this may be predicted using quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar modeling studies in vitro in vivo and clinical studies would be required to ascertain the same in addition to remdesivir other known nucleoside analogs including sofosbuvir ribavirin penciclovir ganciclovir and favipiravir were found to interact with the active site of rdrp of sars-cov-2 fig 1a with high affinities table 1 our findings are in compliance with the study of elfiky5 who reported ribavirin remdesivir sofosbuvir galidesivir and tenofovir as effective inhibitors of sars-cov-2 rdrp using molecular modeling in the present study sofosbuvir was also found to be a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ribavirin an fda-approved synthetic guanosine nucleoside is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov and hcv26 27 28 penciclovir is also a synthetic nucleoside analog  acyclic guanine derivative which has been reported to be effective against herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus29 ganciclovir is also an approved nucleoside analog and effective against hiv30 favipiravir is an investigational nucleoside analog and inhibitor of rdrp and has been reported to be effective against ebola and influenza a h1n1 viruses31 32 33 however the major limitation of the present study is that we have not predicted the inhibitory concentrations of the compounds and thus it is suggested that qsar modeling studies are performed to determine the same furthermore we recommend that in vitro and in vivo studies are performed to first ascertain the effectiveness of the compounds on sars-cov-2 before proceeding to clinical studies the present study reports relative efficacy of 30 compounds in interacting with the active site of rdrp of sars-cov-2 in vitro studies and molecular modeling approaches have indicated that some of the broad-spectrum antivirals including remdesivir can be effective therapeutics against the virus while we report chlorhexidine to be the best inhibitor remdesivir was found to be the most potent among known antivirals nucleoside analogs such as remdesivir mimic the natural substrates of the rdrp and consequently bring about chain termination however other compounds including chlorhexidine are predicted to physically block the active site of the enzyme and thereby affect its activity while clinical trials with remdesivir are ongoing it is recommended that clinical trials be initiated with chlorhexidine and other antivirals to determine their effectiveness against covid-19 thus the present study is of immense significance in the therapeutic intervention against covid-19 the authors have none to declare  repurposing of chloroquine and some clinically approved antiviral drugs as effective therapeutics to prevent cellular entry and replication of coronavirus akinwunmi adeoye o babatunde oso joseph ige olaoye francis habibu tijjani ahmed adebayo i   coronaviruses have long been recognized as important veterinary pathogens causing respiratory and enteric

world health organizations list of high-priority threats zumla et al 2015 in late 2019 a novel coronavirus covid-19 initially designated as 2019-ncov was discovered to be the cause of a large and rapidly spreading outbreak of respiratory disease including pneumonia according to the isolation and viral genome sequence coronavirus was identified as a beta-coronavirus belonging to group 2b with at least 70 similarity in genetic sequence to sars-cov hui et al 2020 and thus became the seventh discrete coronavirus species capable of causing human disease recently chloroquine a medication used primarily to treat malaria is being studied to treat coronavirus its putative anti-viral effects have been hypothesized to be related to the elevation of endosomal and lysosomal ph in addition to its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitory potentials vincent et al 2005 gay et al 2012 unlike viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus sendai virus that can fuse the plasma membrane to successfully infect the host enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses are endocytosed in the endosome and lysosome before fusion aiding its entry into cells plemper 2011 boopathi et al 2020 lysosomal lumens are the most acidic subcellular structure of the cell ph 45 acidification of the lysosomal lumen activates hydrolytic enzymes which lead to the degradation of endocytic cargo ishida et al 2013 however changes in the environment of the lysosome such as a decrease in ph could elicit conformational changes of viral glycoproteins and proteolytic activation of viral glycoproteins by endosomal proteases leading to virions maturation and viral fusion with the host membranes changes huotari  helenius 2011 richards  jackson 2012 park et al 2014 acidification of the lysosomal lumen could enhance the cellular entry of coronavirus thus intracellular extrusion of the proton through modulations of the functions of membrane proton pumps could enhance the elevation of endocytic ph and inhibit viral fusion and subsequent replication in the host proton pumps that have been implicated in endocytic acid-base balance include vacuolar proton-translocating atpase v-atpase and nah exchangers nhe v-atpase is a membrane-bound protein that is required to pump protons into the lysosomal lumen and maintain an acidic luminal ph inhibition of the host v-atpase has been shown to result in a decrease of lysosomal acidification slesiona et al 2012 conversely nhe modulates the luminal ph and na homeostasis by transporting protons out of the lysosomal lumen in exchange for cations hence increasing the luminal ph nakamura et al 2005 prasad  rao 2015 regulation of nhe is mediated by protein kinase a through phosphorylation to sustained intracellular acidosis zhao et al 1999 haworth et al 2003 therefore endocytic acidification could be dissipated through inhibition of protein kinase a moreover binding of the s1 domain of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a key event in the cellular entry of sars-cov-2 li et al 2003 ace2 is a type i integral membrane glycoprotein with an n-terminal extracellular domain comprising 2 -helical lobes which has a catalytic site with a coordinated zinc ion between the lobes li et al 2003 increasing numbers of proteases have been demonstrated to participate in viral infection of host cells in mechanisms where they do not act as receptors these proteases are reported to be involved not only in the adaptation of the virus to innate immune response but also in proteolytic processing of the s protein coronaviruses always produce two types of cysteine proteases a chymotrypsin-like main protease and papain-like proteases pl1pro and pl2pro which are generally important for viral entry and replication elmezayen et al 2020 khan et al 2020a muralidharan et al 2020 the fusion of coronavirus requires proteolytic priming of its spike protein in the endosomal system besides inhibition of lysosomal proteases had been hypothesised to prevent coronavirus fusion as shown in a study using mouse hepatitis virus mhv a safe model of coronavirus de haan et al 2004 hasan et al 2020 joshi et al 2020 various studies had been reported using computational approaches in investigating putative compounds that could be repurposed or repositioned as drugs against coronavirus aanouz et al 2020 elfiky  azzam 2020 enayatkhani et al 2020 enmozhi et al 2020 gupta et al 2020 khan et al 2020b sarma et al 2020 several classes of compounds that had been proposed include phytochemicals and peptides aanouz et al 2020 pant et al 2020 in a quest to identifying potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection this study demonstrated the putative repurposing of some selected clinically approved drugs lopinavir remdesivir oseltamir azithromycin ribavirin and chloroquine recently discovered as inhibitors of v-atpase protein kinase a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and viral proteases through in silico analyses the toxicity risks of azithromycin chloroquine lopinavir oseltamivir remdesivir and ribavirin were predicted based on their admet profile the admet absorption distribution metabolism elimination and toxicity studies were predicted using pkcsm tool httpbiosigunimelbeduaupkcsmprediction pires et al 2015 the smile molecular structures of the

converting enzyme 2 complex sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase a camp-pka and v-atpase with pdb ids 2fe8 2alv 2ajf 4uj1 and 5i1m respectively were retrieved from the protein databank wwwrcsborg berman et al 2000 all the crystal structures were prepared individually by removing existing ligands and water molecules while missing hydrogen atoms were added using autodock v42 program scripps research institute thereafter non-polar hydrogens were merged while polar hydrogen where added to each enzyme the process was repeated for each protein and subsequently saved into pdbqt format in preparation for molecular docking the sdf structures of azithromycin chloroquine lopinavir oseltamivir remdesivir and ribavirin were retrieved from the pubchem database wwwpubchemncbinlmnihgov kim et al 2019 the compounds were converted to mol2 chemical format using open babel oboyle et al 2011 polar hydrogens were added while non-polar hydrogens were merged with the carbons and the internal degrees of freedom and torsions were set the protein and ligand molecules were further converted to the dockable pdbqt format using autodock tools docking of the ligands to various protein targets and determination of binding affinities was carried out using autodockvina trott  olson 2010 pdbqt format of the receptors as well as those of the ligands was dragged into their respective columns and the software was run the binding affinities of compounds for the three protein targets were recorded the compounds were then ranked by their affinity scores molecular interactions between the receptors and compounds with most remarkable binding affinities were viewed with discovery studio visualizer biovia 2016 the respective binding free energy was calculated by the molecular mechanicsgeneralized born surface area mmgbsa using hawkdock server httpcaddzjueducnhawkdock chen et al 2016 the conformational stability of the protein-ligand interactions was evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations analysis performed through imods server httpimodschaconlaborg by normal mode analysis nma predicting properties such as deformability mobility profiles eigenvalues variance co-variance map and elastic network of the protein-ligand interactions lpez-blanco et al 2014 the results of the predicted pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of the azithromycin chloroquine lopinavir oseltamivir remdesivir and ribavirin are presented in tables 15 the prediction was carried out as a methodological virtual screening of the drugs it was included as a substitute to in vivo studies which are important complements in drug discovery the molecular properties of the drugs based on the computed partition coefficient log p showed that the drugs had relatively good lipophilicity as the logp values were less than 5 lipinski et al 1997 hughes et al 2008 table 1 however a negative ribavirin logp value means the ribavirinis a hydrophilic drug that could negatively impact permeability since high lipophilic drugs which are insoluble in aqueous layers could be poorly absorbed and hydrophilic drugs could also contribute to poor permeability all the screened drugs except ribavirin could be maintained in the system at appropriate concentrations moreover the observed lipophilicities correlated negatively with water solubility potentials of the drugs but had an association with caco2 permeability this corresponds to the observation of yazdanian et al 1998 that there was no correlation between the lipophilicity and drug permeability measured using the human colon adenocarcinoma caco-2 cell line assay caco2 permeability and intestinal absorption hia indices are factors that determine the ultimate bioavailability of the drug the drugs had relatively low caco2 permeability potential 8  106 cms and could be absorbed through the human intestine larregieu  benet 2013 however the drugs that have their subcellular localization in the lysosome are remdesivir azithromycin and chloroquine as predicted by admetsar1 cheng et al 2012 lopinavir remdesivir azithromycin and chloroquine were predicted to be substrates of p-glycoprotein an efflux membrane transporter and a member of the atp-binding cassette transporter found primarily in epithelial cells however lopinavir remdesivir and azithromycin were also predicted as p-glycoprotein inhibitors thus lopinavir remdesivir and azithromycin could modulate the physiological functions of p-glycoprotein in limiting the active uptake and the distribution of drugs srivalli  lakshmi 2012 the prediction through the volume of distribution calculated using a steady-state volume of distribution vdss showed that lopinavir azithromycin and ribavirin had lower theoretical dose required for uniform distribution in the plasma than remdesivir oseltamivir and chloroquine while the degree of diffusing across plasma membrane increases in this order lopinavir  remdesivir  chloroquine  azithromycin  oseltamivir  ribavirin measured as the fraction that is in the unbound state table 2 the predictive assessment of the distribution of the drugs through the nervous system showed that lipophilicity of the drugs correlates to the tendency to permeate the blood-brain barrier and the central nervous system passively moreover the moderate levels of the lipophilicity imply the drugs would have no negative effect on nervous system exposure furthermore a group of enzymes that play significant roles in drug metabolism is the cyp isozymes oseltamivir and ribavirin showed low cyp promiscuity while lopinavir remdesivir azithromycin and chloroquine are substrates of cyp3a4 table 3 the lipophilicity of the drug appears to correlate negatively to metabolism-related toxicity lopinavir has the highest cyp promiscuity as it inhibits cyp2c19 cyp2c9 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 this shows that lopinavir could be involved in drug-drug interaction cheng et al 2011 however it could also alleviate the generation of oxidative species cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 and could initiate oxidative stress williams et al 2004 also only chloroquine was a substrate of renal organic cation transporter while other drugs are possibly cleared through other available routes such as bile breath faces and sweat it was observed from the results that all the drugs are absorbable via oral prescription table 4 the bacterial mutagenic potential of drugs through ames toxicity testing showed that all the drugs except chloroquine could be considered as non-mutagenic agents however the toxicities of all the drugs in tetrahymena pyriformis were high the acute toxicity assessed the predictive toxicity of the ligands and described the adversative effects that could occur within a short period after administration lopinavir remdesivir and chloroquine were also shown to have low toxic dose threshold in humans inhibit human ether-a-go-go-related gene herg and induce hepatotoxicity table 5 thus administration of lopinavir remdesivir and chloroquine could result in delayed ventricular repolarisation through inhibition of the herg potassium channel which could lead to a severe disturbance in the normal cardiac rhythm and disrupt hepatic functions wang et al 2012 oso et al 2019 to comprehend the mechanism of ligand binding and to discover potent inhibitors of vacuolar proton-translocating atpase v-atpase cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase a sars-cov spike glycoprotein human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and viral proteases 3-chymotrypsin like and papain-like protease a virtual screening and molecular docking was carried out the in silico studies on the molecular assessment on the possible interactions between drugs and the selected proteins showed that all the drugs had relatively good interaction with the proteins based on their corresponding scoring values as specified by the negative values of the binding free energies oso  olaoye 2020 table 6 the binding free energy by mmgbsa method is presented in table 7 lopinavir has the highest binding affinities to the pocket site of sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase a and 3-chymotrypsin like protease while redemsivir has the highest binding affinities for vacuolar proton-translocating atpase v-atpase and papain-like proteins the observation from this study agrees with the work of nukoolkarn et al 2008 who reported that lopinavir showed a high binding ability to the pocket site of sar-cov it was observed that lopinavir remdesivir and azithromycin have the highest docking scores with the highest number of hydrogen bonds formed respectively while ribavirin has the least docking score with the least hydrogen bonds the calculated binding free energies using the mmgbsa scoring showed that all the proposed drugs have favourable conformations as indicated by the empirical binding free energies with all the proteins except sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex the molecular docking study also predicted the residues at the interacting site of the associated proteins and their corresponding orientations adeoye et al 2019 the amino acids asp269 leu370 his374 and his345 were predicted to be the key residues for lopinavir binding to human sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex while his378 tyr515 leu73 leu100 phe32 and phe40 for remdesivir and tyr510 phe504 met62 tyr50 and his378 were predicted for azithromycin as the key residues for binding to sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex figures 15 and table 8 the results suggest that the high number of hydrogen bond formation could be responsible for the high binding score in lopinavir remdesivir and azithromycin elokely  doerksen 2013 moreover it was also observed that chloroquine which was recently found to be effective in the treatment of novel coronavirus infection has appreciable binding affinities for 3-chymotrpsin- like protease and cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase a when compared to oseltamivir and ribavirin this implies that chloroquine could limit the proliferation of coronavirus by enhancing the activities of nah exchangers leading to elevation of ph of the lysosomal lumen and also limiting the effect of the viral proteases chloroquine could be used in the treatment remedy as it could be an inhibitor of the transporter that could reverse the lysosomal ph gradient by increasing h influx and consequent alkalinity moreover the amino acids his401 ala348 and his378 were predicted to be the key residues for chloroquine binding to human sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex analysis of the results of the autodock software revealed that chloroquine has a considerable binding affinity with coronavirus target protease the results of the molecular dynamics simulation of the docked complexes are presented in figure 6 the deformability graphs of the complexes illustrated the degree of the capability of the respective molecule to deform shown by the peaks figure 6a the empirical b-factor graphs of the complexes presented in figure 6b were obtained from the corresponding pdb field and nma mobility the computed eigenvalues of the docked complexes that characterise the motion stiffness and the movement of the proteins are shown in figure 6c with sars-cov spike glycoproteinace-2 complex predicted to having comparatively the least required energy to deform its structure based on the lowest eigenvalue however the associated variance is inversely related to the eigenvalue with the individual variance indicated by red coloured bars and cumulative variance indicated by green coloured bars figure 6d while the coupling between pairs of residues is illustrated by the co-variance map figure 6e where red colour showed the correlated motion between a pair of residues white colour indicated uncorrelated motion and the anti-correlated motion was indicated by blue colour the elastic network model illustrated by the elastic map figure 6f expresses the connection between the atoms with indicated by dot and the colour gradient of the dot is directly related to their stiffness thus darker spot designate stiffer springs lpez-blanco et al 2014 all the antiviral drugs had binding affinities for sars spike glycoprotein-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and sars-cov main protease out of the five already established antiviral drugs lopinavir had the highest binding affinity towards sars-cov protease while ribavirin had the lowest binding affinity chloroquine recently discovered for the treatment of coronavirus also had a considerable binding affinity to the pocket site of sars spike glycoprotein-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and sars-cov main protease binding of these drugs could interfere or inhibit the functions of coronavirus thereby preventing its cellular entry and proliferation although chloroquine could bind to the selected target proteinsenzymes the result shows it could not be as effective as others however coupling it with metals could improve its binding affinity oseltamivir azithromycin and ribavirin when compared to chloroquine showed good drug-likeness based on the predicted pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties as revealed by low cyp inhibitory promiscuity and relatively low toxicity

coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19  has caused millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide 1 covid-19 has more severe manifestations in older populations with chronic diseases such as obesity hypertension diabetes and chronic kidney disease 2 in the absence of an effective vaccine medication to reduce the severity of covid-19 manifestations is desperately needed while many drugs are under investigation no drugs have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials rcts with a reasonable safety profile 3 the nucleotide analogue remdesivir inhibits rna polymerase limiting viral replication 4 5 it was originally developed to treat ebola but promising in vitro effects were not translated into acceptable clinical efficacy remdesivir has shown antiviral effects on coronaviruses in vitro and a recent study in monkeys infected with covid-19 showed that remdesivir significantly reduced pulmonary damage when administered early 4 6 on may 1 st 2020 the food and drug administration fda issued an emergency use authorization eua for remdesivir in severe hospitalized covid-19 patients valid for one year 7 giving this promising designation we systematically evaluated the human studies assessing the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the treatment of covid-19 we performed a systematic review of rcts and observational studies cohort studies case series evaluating

described in the authorized fact sheet 7 we need the 29-day follow up analyses of the actt in order to reach more definitive conclusions patients may ask specifically for remdesivir therapy because of the eua and feel a failure to do so a substandard practice similarly there is a risk that the benefits and harms of remdesivir will remain unknown if other remdesivir rcts vs placebo are stopped and substituted with trials where remdesivir becomes the standard of care and other experimental drugs are added onto remdesivir versus remdesivir alone our systematic review has several strengths we ran a recent and extensive systematic search in several engines and websites and we did not restrict by language we found commonalities across studies all studies were in adult hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 in particular with pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency all four studies evaluated the same dose and duration of remdesivir 200 mg iv the first day and then 100mg iv qd for nine more days and the two rcts were compared to placebo we also systematically searched for worldwide ongoing rcts and ongoing systematic reviews in prospero that can be found in table 3  some limitations can be highlighted first the number of rcts was scarce and the reporting of the actt-1 is based on 15-day outcomes of the totality of recruited patients second wang et al rct was stopped early for presence of higher proportion of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation in an unplanned interim analysis 11 third our meta-analyses for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes were based only on two rcts however we used outcomes similar time points of follow up and re-categorized heterogeneous ordinal outcome scales into five categories finally all studies included patients within 10 to 15 days of when symptoms began remdesivir antiviral activity should be the highest during the first few days of active viral multiplication as supported by a study performed in monkeys where early administration of remdesivir prevent progression to pneumonia after sars-cov-2 innoculation 6 there is paucity of adequately powered and fully reported rcts evaluating efficacy and harms of remdesivir

remdesivir use in patients with coronavirus covid-19 disease a systematic review and meta-analysis of the chinese lancet trial with the nih trial paul alexander1 elias joshua piticaru1 kimberley lewis1  coronavirus disease 2019  caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has led to significant global mortality and morbidity until now no treatment has proven to be effective in covid-19 to explore whether the use of remdesivir initially an experimental broad-spectrum antiviral is effective in the treatment of hospitalized patients with covid-19 we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials investigating its use a rapid search of the medline and embase medical databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials a systematic approach was used to screen abstract and critically appraise the studies grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade method was applied to rate the certainty and quality of the evidence reported per study two rcts studies were identified n1299 a fixed-effects meta-analysis revealed reductions in mortality rr069 049 to 099 time to clinical improvement 395 less days from 386 days less to 405 less days  serious adverse events rr077 063 to 094 and all adverse events rr087 079 to 096 in this rapid systematic review we present pooled evidence from the 2 included rct studies that reveal that remdesivir has a modest yet significant reduction in mortality and significantly improves the time to recovery as well as significantly reduced risk in adverse events and serious adverse events it is more than likely that as an antiviral remdesivir is not sufficient on its own and may be suitable in combination with other antivirals or treatments such as convalescent plasma research is ongoing to clarify and contextual these promising findings  previous human coronaviruses which resulted in high-morbidity and mortality such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov or sars-1 in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 have driven the development of compounds that could potentially be active against the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 1 2 3 4 approximately 15 of the patients with confirmed covid-19 exhibit severe symptoms and require hospitalization and many of them requiring hospitalization may need intensive care resources 5 the current number of cases worldwide is over five million with over 275000 deaths reported as of may 2020 6 case fatality mortality rates reported to date based on laboratory confirmed cases are likely to overestimate the actual covid-19 mortality rate as they did not include mild or asymptomatic cases that have recovered ideally the infection fatality rate should be reported as comprehensive data is available which would be important to inform planning and response currently no treatment nor prophylaxis has proven to be effective in covid-19 and patients receive either symptomatic treatment for milder presentations or more advanced life-support strategies in moderate to severe cases these include oxygenation strategies in a hospitalized icu setting severe disease results in a rapid progression of respiratory failure that begins usually right after dyspnea breathing difficulties and hypoxemia a cytokine release storm with elevated blood inflammatory markers is a cardinal feature and progression to severe illness can result in severe organ failure with forms of kidney liver and cardiac pathology and injury and indications of coagulopathy and potential shock as the global community eagerly awaits credible scientific solutions for this pandemic researchers and scientists are working hard to identify effective therapeutic and preventive strategies for covid-19 recent research findings on the possible therapeutics such as antivirals antimalarials such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients have been mostly vague inconclusive or negative typically underpinned by very low-quality research methodologies and inadequate reporting78 the very poor methodological quality thus far across the covid-19 research landscape raises many concerns as the medical research community and governments urgently seek an effective prophylactic or therapeutic the methodologies and reporting in these studies have been suboptimal the randomized controlled trials rcts have been plagued with sub-optimal randomization a lack of allocation concealment no or questionable blinding small sample sizes small event numbers and sparse reporting the observational studies have been confounded had small sample sizes small numbers of events sub-optimal or absent statistical adjustments matching propensity score approach stratification or any methodological technique that could mitigate the risk of biased estimates of effect precious time and vast amount of resources are potentially being squandered as the trustworthy robust high-quality research that is needed for evidence-informed decision-making and policy decisions is side-lined this urgency of clinical research has included the repurposing of existing therapies for other diseases based on indirect evidence for example the use of corticosteroids in covid-19 is based on the therapeutic

helped remdesivir gain attention as a possible therapeutic agent1213 prior to the pandemic remdesivir was an unapproved investigational product a recent observational study examining the compassionate use of remdesivir in patients with severe covid-19 revealed that 68 of patients had clinical improvement 14 in april the first rct of remdesivir in patients with severe covid-19 was published however it was not able to identify clinical benefit and had a small sample size and failed to reach the enrolment target in early may 2020 the us federal drug administration fda authorized the use of remdesivir for the treatment of individuals with severe covid-19 based on preliminary data from the actt-1 study due to the rapid spread of covid-19 with its concerning morbidity and mortality it is unlikely we will see further randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials in light of existing data given the urgency for an effective therapeutic we conducted a rapid review of the existing medical research literature assessing studies using remdesivir in rcts in patients with covid-1915 16 we were alert to and considered all studies published since the global pandemic began in january 2020 while recognizing that the two rcts would likely comprise our final cohort of included studies medline and embase electronic databases were searched from january 1st 2020 to may 22nd 2020 using a mix of keywords such as covid-19 and remdesivir along with any relevant variants the search did use an rct filter see appendix for medline search example pubmed was also searched daily during this period to rapidly assess any emerging publications evidence was considered from additional sources including google scholar and online preprint servers that pre-publish studies not yet having completed the peer-review process we also searched the largest clinical medicine preprint repository medrxivorg two reviewers independently and in duplicate extracted relevant data and assessed risk of bias using the cochrane risk of bias tool for rcts 17 we adopted response options for risk of bias to be yes probably yes probably no and no thereby removing the unclear response often reported by reviewers the use of the unclear response frequently hampers a more definitive interpretation of risk of bias 18 we used fixed-effect inverse-variance modeling for all analyses mantel-haenszel risk

the heterogeneity is high and must be considered d high i2 68 the two randomized-controlled trial studies presented in this systematic review focused on remdesivir use in hospitalized covid-19 patients our pooled analysis reveals that remdesivir significantly reduces mortality time to clinical improvement the number of people with serious adverse events and the number of people with any adverse events the grade quality of evidence also known as certainty or confidence in estimates of effect reflects the extent of our certainty or confidence that the estimates of an effect are adequate to support a particular decision or recommendation 23 we found some issues applying grade with indirectness imprecision and inconsistency across the body of evidence for the analyzed patientimportant outcomes we have low certainty or confidence in the range of mortality effects despite reportedly significant benefits of a decrease in mortality with 37 fewer deaths per 1000 with a range from 61 fewer to 1 fewer death the range of mortality absolute risk effect ranges from a 51 reduction to a 1 reduction of risk the low certainty in the risk of mortality estimates are due to the serious concerns with imprecision due to a small number of events and indirectness due to the pooling of 14 day and 28-day mortality results we made the judgement to pool mortality data based on the hazard ratio kaplan-meier data and not simply the raw data reported in table 2 32 in remdesivir vs 54 in placebo with samples sizes of 538 and 521 respectively incidentally mortality reductions would have been even more favourable we employed a fix-effect model given the small number of studies and a decision to focus more weight on the study with the larger sample size contributes more information we are moderately confident remdesivir in patients hospitalized with covid-19 leads to faster clinical improvement with an important and significant decrease in time to clinical improvement using remdesivir of 395 fewer days ranging from 405 fewer to 386 fewer days we are highly confident in an important and significant decrease in severe adverse events with the use of remdesivir in the individuals hospitalized with covid-19 with 62 fewer severe events per 1000 ranging from 99 fewer to 16 fewer serious adverse events using random effect modelling did not change the pooled point estimates or confidence intervals appreciably in the context of harms and benefits of the intervention for all reported outcomes except for all adverse events for all adverse events the use of random-effects modeling led to a confidence interval that spanned harms and benefits with fixed-effect modeling the confidence interval was wholly in the benefits portion leading us to be moderately certain in a modest reduction in adverse events given the reduction in imprecision for all adverse events outcome the grade assessment was moderate with fixed effect modeling and low with random-effects modeling our study has several strengths firstly we assessed the eligibility of all studies and the risk of bias independently and in duplicate we intended the summary pooling of the data had we judged that the data was reliable enough to allow a meaningful pooled estimate of effect additionally we intended the use of the grade approach to assess the certainty or quality of the evidence our analysis of the available literature had significant limitations including the paucity of studies available for analysis the research evidence on the benefits of remdesivir in covid-19 is however in our judgement based on two rigorous multicenter trials additionally there was significant heterogeneity in the time to clinical improvement which could be due to the location of the studies and the differences in standard of care between the studies that were conducted at different periods in the context of the evolving evidence landscape during the pandemic timing of initiation of remdesivir may also impact clinical outcomes with patients with more severe disease being less likely to survive as seen in the actt-1 subgroups however we were unable to pool data according to these subgroups due to the public health emergency of the covid-19 pandemic there likely will not be any additional randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial to determine remdesivirs efficacy in patients with covid-19 and instead it would be incorporated into standard of care in addition remdesivir appears to reduce the time to clinical improvement and the number of serious adverse events and can ameliorate the conditions at many overwhelmed hospitals facing the pandemic patient surges all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the

in patients suffering from sars-cov-2 life-threatening respiratory failure indeed persists we are still left with questions and clinicians must interpret this pooled evidence with caution though very promising further research on the use of other therapeutic agents in covid-19 patients is urgently needed and it is more likely that remdesivir would be of most utility when used in combination with

the provision of health services currently no therapeutic option has been shown to be effective though remdesivir is presently revealing promise as one option likely in conjunction with another treatment s and that conclusively allows for safe and effective use to mitigate or eliminate the causative agent of covid-19 the very same can be said about prophylaxis whereby approximately 200 therapeutic options or their combinations are being investigated in more than 1700 clinical trials severely ill patients with covid-19 frequently older adults and with established comorbidities are being given multiple concomitant medications and without considering possible adverse events and interactions this is an area of research that is being overlooked and the potential toxicity due to concomitant treatments must be urgently addressed we again remind that the use of medications such as chloroquine hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin ivermectin antivirals and immunomodulators among others should be considered within the context of patient consented randomized clinical trials that evaluate their safety and efficacy ensuring the safety of patients with covid-19 requires information and surveillance systems that include standardized procedures in order to report adverse events and interactions according to local settings and public health reporting

of pneumonia was detected in wuhan china and was communicated to the world health organization who country office china on 31 december 2019 after a thorough examination it was identified as a coronavirus cov a zoonotic virus that causes a range of illnesses including middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars due to sars-cov was initially identified in 2002 while mers emerged in 2012 which was caused by mers-cov infection the most recent coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 provisionally called 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was never known to be identified in humans previously however the outbreak did not confine to china rapidly spread to other parts of the world and soon who has recognized 2019-ncov as pandemic on 11 march 2020 besides it is also the seventh and newest member of the coronavirus which reports to be infectious to humans zhu et al 2020 currently 4647961 confirmed cases and 308985 total deaths due to 2019-ncov had been reported worldwide as on 04 may 2020 who in india the latest statistics by the ministry of health and family welfare have reported 85940 and 30153 total confirmed cases and deaths respectively wwwmohfwgovin the contagious virus 2019-ncov can spread primarily through the viral droplets of saliva and discharges from the nose of the infected person while coughing or sneezing and also touching contaminated surfaces pant et al 2020 the typical viral infection symptoms of 2019-ncov are dry cough running nose fever shortness of breath in majority of cases some cases reported severe conditions such as pneumonia severe acute respiratory distress syndrome kidney failure with fatal consequences elfiky 2020 however as of now there is no vaccine against this virus which is the cause of the utmost trepidation globally nevertheless the scientific fraternity all over the world has commenced with assiduous research work to understand the nature of virus which may subsequently lead to the discovery of medicine and vaccine however several researchers have recognized that to investigate the routes of viral spread among humans the site of activation must be identified this led to identify the sites of various viruses including influenza family virus which enable uninterrupted spread of virus hasan et al 2020 the first line of treatment is targeted to treat the symptoms of the disease most of the symptoms of individuals affected with 2019-ncov were similar to influenza and both viruses cause respiratory issues influenza is a communicable disease caused by the influenza virus this rna virus contains seven genera influenzavirus a influenzavirus b influenzavirus c influenzavirus d isavirus thogotovirus and quaranjavirus among these influenzavirus a influenzavirus b influenzavirus c can infect humans the influenzavirus a virus is the most virulent human pathogens and can cause flu pandemics kumar et al 2018 in humans some of the serotypes which are known to cause pandemic deaths are h1n1 known to cause spanish flu and swine flu h1n2 endemic in humans and pigs h2n2 asian flu h3n2 hong kong flu h5n1 bird flu h7n7 unusual zoonotic potential and h7n2 low pathogenicity avian influenza virus hay et al 2001 the study on viral composition revealed that the hemagglutinin-esterase he glycoprotein gene is found in the beta coronaviruses and this he gene of coronaviruses have sequence homology with influenza he glycoprotein and may reflect early recombination between the two viruses luytjes et al 1988 additionally coronavirus spike s protiens can get attached to the human cell especially lungs surfaces via angiotensin converting enzyme ace2 receptors primarily s1s2 site in the coronavirus s protein is subjected to proteolytic cleavage by host proteases trypsin and furin later cleavage of s2 site occurs which releases fusion peptide and triggers the activation of membrane fusion mechanism boopathi et al 2020 hence it can be assumed that the mode of action of the drugs used in the treatment of influenza can work successfully in the same line to treat 2019-ncov therefore the clinical trials conducted revealed that most of the drugs inhibit the critical components of the 2019-ncov life cycle the lifecycle includes viral entry into the host cell viral replication and viral rna synthesis boopathi et al 2020 the previous research exertions to develop the anti-viral drugs against the coronaviridae family receptors via ace2 rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp and the main protease mpro also called 3clpro proteins as potential drug targets among mpro as an attractive drug target among coronaviruses family which is essential and have a signiant role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral rna anand et al 2003 hilgenfeld 2014 ton et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however the mpro protein sequence of 2019-ncov is similar to the sequences of sars-cov and mers-cov proteins which are mainly involved in the replication cycle harrison 2020 therefore obstruction in the replication cycle may prove a suitable solution for the drug quest since no specific therapy for 2019-ncov is at-hand and considering public health priority an immediate and effectual vaccinedrug is a crucial requisite gilead sciences inc united states us has started the first clinical trial to

httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04261270 httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04303299 clinical trials for the various antiviral drugs are ongoing to find an effective treatment for 2019-ncov however since the time-period estimated for the completion of the trials is too long bioinformatics technology used to assess the efficacy of each drug individually at a molecular level and in complex with multiple probabilities hence in view of the complex mechanisms associated with various drugs there is a need to identify the drug which targets viral replication especially on the mpro enzyme of 2019-ncov the most suitable drugs predicted using bioinformatics tools and techniques may be used for further trials and may be prescribed for 2019-ncov patients therefore the current aim of the study is to dock

2019-ncov mpro and was chosen as a reference structure for further molecular docking analysis for validation the obtained sequence and structure results of a similar sequence were equated with clustalx higgins  sharp 1988 by performing pairwise sequence alignment with a 6lu7 amino acid sequence the active-site residues of the 6lu7 mpro complex with n3 were visualized by using pymol so far there is no particular antibody and medications against 2019-ncov specialists are presently taking a shot at various antiviral drugs immunotherapies and immunizations that are being researched to discover the potential treatment for 2019-ncov as of now countless fda approved antiviral agents are in use for the treatment of 2019-ncov viral infection however numerous examples exist in which the utilization of a second antiviral agent would be advantageous because it would permit the choice of either option or a combination therapeutic approach as 2019-ncov infections have risen the focus on encoded proteases to discover potent antiviral medications are in progress recent molecular studies have demonstrated that viral proteases existence pattern depends upon numerous infections by affecting the cleavagecatalyzing process of viral polyprotein antecedents which are high molecular weightessential proteins important for assembly and morphogenesis of virus particles most of the chosen protease inhibitors are utilized principally for the treatment of herpesvirus human immunodeficiency virus hiv respiratory syncytial infection and flu a viruses and can also be used for the treatment of 2019-ncov in this scenario sequence and structure analysis was performed for 2019-ncov mpro through blast results revealed that mpro nucleotide sequence has 99 identity and 40 of query coverage with sars-cov as mentioned in the introduction section remdesivir chloroquine favipiravir baloxavir marboxil ribavirin penciclovir nafamostat nitazoxanide oseltamivir and zanamivir ae chosen for the molecular docking analysis and the same inhibitors retrieved from the pubchem database molecular docking perceived in silico structure-based strategy is broadly utilized in drug design and discovery approaches molecular docking empowers to identify novel compounds of therapeutic interest for the emerging pandemic infectious outbreaks by predicting the inhibitor-receptor interactions even though it initially evolved for assisting to understand the mechanism of molecular binding recognition among small compounds and receptor molecules in recent years uses and applications of molecular docking have profoundly changed to help in the rapid development of drug discovery khandare et al 2018 munikumar et al 2019 pradhan et al 2014 three-dimensional structure of 2019-ncov mpro with n3 peptide pdb id 6lu7 was obtained from the protein data bank pdb jin et al 2020 for molecular docking analysis a fully automated docking software tool autodock 42 which is most widely used to study the receptor-ligand binding and interactions was used for the docking of selected inhibitors with 2019-ncov mpro structure the receptor and ligand files were denoted in pdbqt file format a modified pdb format containing atomic charges atom type definitions for ligands and topological information rotatable bonds receptor molecule was initially fixed by adding polar hydrogen kollman charges azam  abbasi 2013 morris et al 2009 selected inhibitor molecules were added with gasteiger charges sliwoski et al 2014 autodock 42 allows setting a specific target site with the help of a grid box the x y and z dimensions were set to 404040 the x center y center and z center with a grid spacing of 1  keeping the receptor rigid and the ligand as a flexible molecule was adjusted by n3 peptide-binding site of the 6lu7 jin et al 2020 the output for each inhibitors conformations was analyzed using a stochastic lamarckian genetic algorithm morris et al 2009 after characterizing the coupling site and receptor-ligand readiness docking runs were propelled from the command prompt the molecular interactions the energy between every ligand and the receptor was determined for the binding site which expressed as affinity kcalmol and favourable conformations the 3 d visualization of docked structures was performed using a graphical user interface maestro schrodinger 2020-1 khandare et al 2018 munikumar et al 2019 umamaheswari et al 2011 further molecular dynamics simulations were performed with outmost docked complex and co-crystal structure native for the stability was close to biologically relevant characteristics molecular dynamics md simulations were carried out using the desmond 2018-4 simulations module of schrdinger llc to simulate the outmost docked complex and native co-crystal with n3 peptide a simple point charge spc of the hoh molecule model was accounted alongside orthorhombic periodic boundary box x y and z-axis conditions were set up to specify the shape and size of the complex unit buffered at 10  distances the docked complex was neutralized with the system electrically by adding appropriate counter nacl ions to balance the system charge and were placed randomly in the solvated system after building the solvated system protein-ligand complex minimization and relaxation were performed under the constant number of atoms pressure

solvent-accessible surface area sasa and total intramolecular h-bonds contributing to the structural stability the sqa and sea are useful parameters to qualitatively validate the complex system stability throughout the 100 ns run and protein changes at the simulated length of chemical time for the given temperature pressure and volume of the total simulation box multiple sequence alignment of the retrieved mpro sequences was performed and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega-x felsenstein 1985 the evolutionary history was inferred by applying the maximum likelihood method and the jtt matrix-based model it is found that the tree is having the highest log-likelihood of 3186 figure 1 with selected seven mpro sequences the construction of initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by enforcing with neighbor-join and bionj algorithms and jtt model used for estimating matrix of pairwise distances to select the topology with superior log likelihood value the constructed phylogeny tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site of sequence the proportion of each sites in which at least one unambiguous base was present in at least one sequence for each descendent clade was shown next to each internal node in the tree for interim datasets preparation a total of 7444 pair-wise positions were constituted with seven mpro sequences for phylogeny analysis the resultant trees were evaluated by 500 bootstrap replicates felsenstein 1985 the alignment shows that amongst the seven mpro protein sequences identical with bat sars-cov four sequences are from different human coronaviruses isolates one from mers cov and one from bat sars cov isolate notably the 2019-ncov of mpro is identical 100 with bat sars-cov and distantly related 34 to human coronavirus 229e figure 1a results suggest that mpro of 2019-ncov was evolved from bat sars-cov further phylogenetic analysis is performed with 500 mpro protein sequence from the ncbi viral genome database till 4th may 2020 figure 1b the results show that a minimum of 51 evolutionary relationship was observed among the geographically distributed mpro protein sequences the 2019-ncov is an enveloped positive-sense single-strand rna virus infecting primarily respiratory system it also infects the gastrointestinal epithelial cells macrophages and other cell types thereby triggering the systemic changes and damage to many vital organs for instance lung heart liver kidney and adrenal gland anti-2019-ncov therapeutics could target several major viral pathogeneses such as virus-cell interactions virus entry intracellular viral replication and virus assembly and exit lu 2020 medhi et al 2020 the intracellular replication of 2019-ncov was mediated by replicase complex derived from virally coded polyprotein precursor of mpro 306 aa 2019-ncov and sars-cov-2 mpro proteins share 99 identity in amino acid sequences and 100 binding site figure 2a importantly mpro protein of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have a high degree of homology in three domains figure 2b 1 domain i residues 8 to 101 2 domain ii residues 102 to 184 comprises of two--barrel fold similar to that of the chymotrypsin-type serine peptidases and 3 domain iii residues 201 to 300 has five -helices and is connected to domain ii by a long loop residues 185 to 200 jin et al 2020 to validate the docking protocol docking and superimposing the co-crystal structures of the 2019-ncov mpro and sars cov mpro was done figures 3 and 4 at first the docking was performed with the co-crystal structure of 2019-ncov ie mpro with n3 peptide and the docked complex was superimposed with the native co-crystal structure mpro with n3 peptide complex the superimposition has 0923 rmsd which precisely coincided with each other figure 3a whereas n3 peptide have 98 identical interactions in a superimposed complex within a 4 region of molecular binding-site of domains i and ii figure 3b second as we have found that 2019-ncov pdb id 6lu7 mpro have 100 sequence identity with bat sars-cov pdb id 2a5k to validate the same using co-crystal

with n3 peptide complex was taken and superimposed figure 4a the resulted docked complex was superimposed with the native co-crystal structure 2a5k with aza peptide the superimposition has 1029 rmsd which precisely coincided with each other figure 4b third superimposition has 0095 rmsd with 100 of conserved binding site residues of docked complex of 6lu7n3 and co-crystal stricture of 2a5kaza was observed each other figure 3b further validation of mpro binding pocket we obtained 84 co-crystal protein sequence of 2019-ncov mpro from the pdb till 4 may 2020 supplementary figure 1 and performed multiple sequence analysis msa by exploring schrodinger software the results revealed that binding site residues are 100 conserved amongst the geographically distributed mpro protein sequences of 2019-ncov the co-crystal mpro with n3 peptide positioned in the cleft between domain i and ii shares nine h-bonds with bond length 1 phe140319 2 gly143287 3 cys145232 4 his163238 5 his164280 6 glu166283 7 glu166298 8 gln189289 and 9 thr190285 were observed in both native and docking complexes within 4 radii the van der waals vdw interactions of thr24 thr25 thr26 his41 met49 tyr54 phe140

within 4 radii table 1 the 100 conserved binding sites interactions and significant superimposed rmsd scores of the above docking approaches suggest that the autodock 42 software docking protocol could be used for the identification of potent inhibitor computer-aided drug designingstructure-based drug designing for the novel drug discovery against 2019-ncov the docking complex of each mpro inhibitors with 2019-ncov mpro was analysed by the schrodinger maestro 2020-1 visualization tool the selected anti-viral protease inhibitors led to the better docking score and binding interactions than n3 peptide within the cleft of domain i and domain ii figure 2b the results revealed that the protease inhibitors were having better molecular docking scores with a strong binding affinity with the mpro of 2019-ncov the present study results also represented here are starting with better binding score to least binding score remdesivir  baloxavir marboxil  nafamostat  nitazoxanide  penciclovir  zanamivir  ribavirin  oseltamivir  chloroquine  favipiravir table 1 and figure 5a and b thus the evidence from the molecular docking score and binding affinity suggested that these inhibitors are eminently interacting with 2019-ncov mpro and might be considered for therapeutic interventions of 2019-ncov figure 5b among the inhibitors the remdesivir attributed to the best docking score 82 kcalmol with greater number of h-bond five interactions and bond lengths with the following mpro amino acid residues 1 pro39 2 cys145 3 his163 4 his163 and 5 met165 figure 4a moreover his164

remdesivir and native mpro  n3 peptide complex system was entrenched with hoh volume v temperature t and pressure p observed by md simulation of 100 ns supplementary figure 2 each trajectory was analysed for stability conformation through rmsd rmsf rgyr and h-bond monitoring figure 6 the docked and native complexes are depicted the average of total energy 13244636 and 9950123 kcalmol potential energy 16273498 and 12162890 kcalmol of the system was relatively stable with the average temperature 29865 kelvin pressure 188 bar and volume 50288487 and 36227877  throughout the simulations run supplementary figure 2 the rmsd during the simulations period was analysed for mpro c  remdesivir complex had an average of 148  and 186  respectively the average rmsd for native mpro c  n3 peptide complex was 165  and 1909  respectively figure 6a by contrast native n3 peptide had largest average rmsd score with native mpro and docked complex was not stable significantly throughout the md simulation run figure 6a the rmsf plot for the mpro docked and native c and side-chain showed an average of 088  139  094  and 144  respectively which denotes the lower atomic fluctuations in binding residues indicating smaller conformational changes figure 6b the total energy potential energy rmsd and rmsf analysis revealed that the 2019-ncov mpro  remdesivir docking complex was highly stable during the entire 100 ns md simulations remdesivir formed two intermolecular h-bonds with post dynamics structure of mpro residues gly143 cys-145 were observed to remain stable in all the trajectories during md simulations run figure 7b and table 2 additionally glu 166 was formed h-bond and salt bridge with mpro and maintained all trajectories moreover four hoh molecules were formed six water-mediated h-bonds with remdesivir compound table 2 the post md simulations the n3 peptide formed six h-bonds with the native structure residues 5 of gly143 his163 his164 glu166 and thr190 and additionally leu141 was formed h-bond with mpro of 2019-ncov remained stable throughout the period of 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations moreover similar trends were observed when calculating the rgyr of docked and native complexes figure 7a the rgyr represents the average distance between each atom complexes and the center of mass of the structures and was a useful value to provide a structural measure of the degree of compaction of the studied complexes with md simulations figure 6c depicts the evolution of the rgyr of each complex over the full md simulations trajectories the comparison of rgyr average trends towards native and docked depicts 2366  and 2277  respectively displayed stable over time suggesting that both complexes have reached a more compact structure figure 6c whereas figure 6d and 6e shows the average sasa of both docked and native has 15229 2 and 16199 2 respectively were observed in 100 ns simulations many ongoing clinical studies also suggests that remdesivir is much better at inhibiting the sars-cov and mers-cov remdesivir has shown wide therapeutic index and demonstrated anti-viral activity against rna viruses and also are selective for viral polymerases along with low susceptibility to cause any human toxicity agostini et al 2018 sheahan et al 2020 drugs delayed chain-termination act is conceived as one of the most crucial mechanisms of action especially in treatment against mers-cov and ebov siegel et al 2017 jordan et al 2018 tchesnokov et al 2019 in coronaviruses remdesivir also exhibited high genetic hurdle resistance and also permits one-time daily dosage because of its extended intracellular half-life agostini et al 2018 sheahan et al 2020 this in silico study also suggests that remdesivir has a good docking score with strong binding affinity and stable confirmations with the crucial residues cys145 and his164 of mpro which inhibits the replication and proliferation of 2019-ncov according to who the recommended administration of remdesivir for ebola virus ebov in single or multiple-dose phase intravenous between 3 mg and 225 mg the risk for central nervous system respiratory or cardiovascular effects was considered low at projected therapeutic exposures and is well tolerated without any evidence of kidney or liver toxicity moreover the consistent antiviral activity of remdesivir for filoviruses ebola zaire sudan bundibugyo and marburg was observed similar antiviral activity was observed also against pathogenic coronaviruses mers and sars cov and paramyxoviruses nipah and hendra discerning for viral polymerases thus the present in silico and ongoing clinical studies are also suggesting that the remdesivir is a potent inhibitor against 2019-ncov the novel human respiratory coronavirus initially called as 2019  novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has emphasized the insurgency for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop a novel evolving epidemic of infectious zoonotic diseases till now no therapeutic vaccine and drugs against 2019-ncov are available previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses such as sars-cov 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 motivated the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging pandemic 2019-ncov the most promising compound remdesivir currently in clinical trials for treating the ebov infections also inhibited the replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in tissue cultures and displayed efficacy in non-human animal models besides a combination of the hiv-1 protease inhibitors is shown to be effective in patients infected with sars-cov this in silico study also suggested that anti-viral protease inhibitor remdesivir has the best docking score and binding activity when compared to selected inhibitors and existing peptides with 2019-ncov of mpro these inhibitors were tightly bound to the domains i and ii cleft of very crucial key residues of cys145 and his164 of 2019-ncov which could inhibit the replication and proliferation in the host the in silico assessment of a single dose with a combination of multiple protease inhibitors against the 2019-ncov of mpro is the limitation of this study this study will pave the path for the identification of potential personalized medicine by novel drug designing for different genomic mutations of 2019-ncov  journal pre-proof remdesivir investigational trials in covid-19 a critical reappraisal remdesivir investigational trials in covid-19 a critical reappraisal revised p brouqui a giraud-gatineau d raoult  during outbreak of emerging disease the most important aim is to discover an effective drug to save life consequently a lot of effort are generally made by the industry to promote clinical trials with new drugs here we review evidence of the 8 most recent reports including 3 randomized controlled trials on the clinical efficacy of remdesivir in treating covid-19 patient we conclude that it is far too premature to identify remdesivir as a curative or life-saving intervention  since the first described infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-2 cov2 in december 2019 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has developed into a pandemic 3 the symptoms of which range from asymptomatic course to pneumonia acute lung and multi-organ 4 failure and death in order to develop a meaningful therapy strategy different medications are used 5 off label one of these is remdesivir a precursor of a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral rna 6 polymerases as for ebola sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7 remdesivir appears to be effective in vitro in sars-cov2 1 good outcomes have been reported in 8 cases report 23 many studies are ongoing or already published to demonstrate the efficacy of 9 remdesivir on patient with covid-19 some showing the lack of difference with control arms 4  10 some others reporting efficacy but discussed 5-7 treating patients early in disease has always been 11 a crucial issue in treating potentially life-threatening infectious diseases the aim of this review 12 presented below was to evaluate the quality of the published and not yet peer-reviewed trials on 13 remdesivir and to highlight pitfalls to inform readers that a careful analysis of reported data is 14 needed to offer a more accurate interpretation of the results 15 we looks at all scientific paper available as peer and not yet peer reviewed paper in the major 17 literature from data base pub med web of knowledge scholar google and biorxiv and medrxiv the 18 key words were remdesivir alone or with covid we recover 91 articles in medrxiv 81 in biorxiv 19 and 112 in pub med when we added covid to remdesivir pubmed recover 79 articles on web of 20 knowledge remdesivir recover 25 articles in scholar google remdesivir recovered 1480 articles in 21 2020 of them we selected 17 papers responding to the aims of this article when available we look 22 at the following endpoints time to improvement at d14 and 28 death and adverse events 23 as today 8 studies report the use of remdesivir in covid and are summarized in table 1 the first is a  25 single case having received remdesivir on the day 11 of disease and which on day 12 saw condition 26 improve stopping oxygenation and oxygen saturation at 96 8 27 the second is a non-yet peer review paper that reports the first 12 case of covid in the united 28 states it is a descriptive paper in which 3 of the 7 hospitalized patients received remdesivir for 29 compassionate use for a duration of 4-10 days 9  all hospitalized patient had serial sarscov2 rt 30 pcr testing when reanalyzed the mean delay in normalization of nasal rt pcr was 86 days in 31 remdesivir patient versus 675 days p085 in untreated patient 32 the third reports a series of 5 cases 3 of which received at least one dose of remdesivir in two 33 patients treatment occurred at the time of the diseases worsening in one of them the remdesivir 34 was discontinued after 5 days alt elevation and rash in the third patient the remdesivir was 35 stopped after a single dose due to renal dialysis to avoid the accumulation of cyclodextrin therefore 36 the authors indicate that they cannot draw any conclusions based on their data as to the potential 37 efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of covid-19 3 38 the fourth study analyzes the remdesivir treatment of a single patient on the day 13 of his disease 39 2 at the time of remdesivir administration the patient was in intensive care intubated and treated 40 with hydroxychloroquine 400mgday and azithromycin since 7 days forty-eight hours after 41 remdesivir initiation or treatment the patients condition had improved the patient was extubated 42 60 hours after treatment and was able to breathe in the ambient air 24 hours later 43 the fifth study is an uncontrolled prospective open observational study of patients having received 44 as compassionate used a 10-day remdesivir therapy with a target follow-up period of 28 days 45 between 25012020 and 07032020 61 patients were included in the study and received at least 46 one dose of remdesivir some of which may have been part of previous studies of those patients 8 47 were excluded of the study which in an intention to treat analysis should have been considered as 48 failure finally data from 53 patients were analyzed of whom one was already published in the study 49 n3 lescure et al of them 40 received the complete 10-day remdesivir therapy 10 received 5 to 9-50 day therapy and 3 patients received less than 5 days of remdesivir 7  on average covid-19 51 symptoms lasted 12 days before remdesivir therapy was initiated in the median follow-up period of 52 18 days 36 of the 53 patients 68 were able to improve under remdesivir an improvement was 53 shown in all patients who were mild receiving no or only low-dose oxygen supplementation n  12 54 or in 5 of the 7 non-invasive ventilated patients this also raised an ethical comment on the 55 compassionate used of remdesivir in some patients whom were not engaged in short term of the 53 56 patients followed 10 were treated while they were on ambient air 2 or low flow oxygen  8 time to recovery and death at 28 days and 100  of patient enrolled end the study and were 76 evaluated in both intention to treat itt and per protocol pp analysis serious adverse event or 77 event leading to stop the drug were reported in 18 and 12  in remdesivir versus 6 and 5 in 78 placebo demonstrating the poor safety of the drug although no significant difference was noted in 79 other treatment between the two groups in almost all the rct reporting evaluation of treatment for 80 covid patient are also treated with several other drugs such as antibiotics 9 among some have 81 demonstrated antiviral efficacy 11  corticosteroid antiviral  and anti-inflammatory among which 82 some anti il6 seems promising 12  this may bias the data such as shown in the hillaker et al study 83 cited above this questioned the multicentric nature of the randomized controlled studies which is 84 needed by the high number of patients to be enrolled this is a bias which is difficult to control 85 because it is directly related to the standard of care of each center likely to be different in term of 86 equipment protocols surveillance and staff skills consequently the care of patient might not be 87 comparable in between centers and the outcome biased by the expertise of the team in charged 88 in the preliminary announcement on efficacy of remdesivir on an rct involving 1061 patients  the 89 nih said that preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31 faster 90 time to recovery than those who received placebo 11 days15 days but that the survival benefit on 91 1063 patients was insignificant compared to placebo p0059 concluding that remdesivir has an 92 effect but not a wonder effect in her commentary mahase said  in time of epidemics expedite 93 publication are fine but hinting that results are going to be positive only benefits the drug companies 94 6 fast-flowing conflicting information on remdesivir in the past few weeks has left people reeling 95 recently the paper was released with preliminary reports in the nejm but with different results the 96 survival benefits becoming significant in the overall analyzed population 13 this conclusion is over 97 interpreted in the table 2 as mentioned the hazard ratio indicates that only mild form of infection 98 benefit from remdesivir but that there is no difference in severe form of covid-19 with placebo it is 99 noteworthy to notice that results are given in intention to treat but that one third of enrolled patient 100 in both arms only 338  357 received the complete protocol 180531 and 185518 for 101 remdesivir and placebo respectively of them 288 1049 274 were discharged because they were 102 cured before the end of treatment and were loss of follow up the remaining still receiving the 103 treatment or having missing treatment data at time to analyses while an analysis according to the 104 itt principle aims to preserve the original randomization and to avoid potential bias due to exclusion 105 of patients such a number of loss of follow up is unacceptable because it might modified the 106 benefits of randomization those loss to follow-up often having a different prognosis than those who 107 complete the study 14 in this study 168 patient were discharged before the end of treatment in 108 the remdesivir arms versus 120 in the placebo which is significantly different p0001 it is likely 109 that those patients had a baseline score of 4 or 5 as they discharge before the end of treatment 110 explaining in part the better outcome in the remdesivir arms some have suggested that 5 loss 111 leads to little bias while 20 poses serious threats to validity 15  nevertheless a per-protocol pp 112 analysis as recommend in the consort guidelines should be reported for all planned outcomes to 113 allow readers to interpret the effect of an intervention 16 114 the last released paper compares 5 days to 10 days treatment for remdesivir with no significant 115 mortality nor improvement of clinical status between the two arms altogether any serious adverse 116 event is reported in 277 of treated patient among them 47 of acute kidney injury in 73 of 117 patient adverse events lead to stop the treatment 17 118 still few studies have been reported on evaluation the new drug remdesivir in many aspects data 119 from a case report or series without controls mean little to nothing in the context of evaluating 120 efficacy of an experimental drug on the other hand rcts takes time and rarely bring usable 121 information during time of outbreak three rcts have data available but two share the same aims 122 and give contradictory data only one is methodologically adequate with both ipp and pp analysis on 123 a cohort of patient having completed the study demonstrating the absence of difference between 124 drugs and standard of care 125 as today no study convincingly supports the use of remdesivir in severe patients it is likely that such 126 as for influenza the major key for

clinical picture ranging from mild to severe including death1 there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for covid-19 patients with covid-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms2 therefore testing the efficacy of existing drugs used for other viruses against sars-cov-2 is a fundamental goal in order to develop a specific therapy rapidly small molecules such as nucleoside analogues or protease inhibitors are candidate drugs as treatments for covid-193 among these nucleoside analogues remdesivir gs-5734 a diastereomer monophosphophoramidate prodrug of the adenine nucleoside analogue gs-441524 is under evaluation gs-441524 undergoes metabolic conversion in cells and tissues into the pharmacologically active triphosphate form gs-443902 that inhibits viral rna polymerases but does not affect host rna or dna polymerases4 remdesivir showed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity with potent in vitro efficacy against multiple genetically unrelated rna viruses similar to sars-cov-2 such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov according to several in vitro studies remdesivir appears to be the most promising candidate for covid-19 treatment58 in vero cells infected with sars-cov-2 remdesivir molecular weight 6026 gmol showed an ec50 of 460 ngml5 however for gs-441524 molecular weight 2913 gmol ec50 data from cells infected with sars-cov-2 have not been reported in humans remdesivir showed moderate protein binding 8090 and gs-441524 exhibited very low protein binding in plasma 209 preliminary data from human healthy donors confirm that remdesivir is extensively metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 specific metabolism data on gs-441524 have not been reported the half-lives are about 089 and 25 h for remdesivir and gs-441524 respectively remdesivir is mainly excreted in urine about 74 the predominant species detected in urine were gs-441524 followed by remdesivir and other

terminated 8 recruiting have been initiated to evaluate intravenous remdesivir in adult patients with mild moderate and severe covid-19 clinicaltrialsgov to date there are no pharmacokinetic pk data for sars-cov-2-infected patients the only published pk data were obtained from observations of ebola treatment in monkeys8 the aim of our study was to investigate remdesivir and gs-441524 plasma concentrations in two critically ill covid-19 patients treated with intravenous remdesivir moreover compartmental concentrations were evaluated in bronchoalveolar aspirate bas in both patients and in a csf sample from one of them the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki as well as with national and institutional standards informed consent was obtained from family members all data were collected anonymously the two patients were a female patient 1 pt1 and a male patient 2 pt2 66 and 67 years old respectively both were residents of the city of wuhan china who had travelled to italy in january they developed fever with respiratory symptoms subsequently they were admitted to the national institute of infectious diseases lazzaro spallanzani in rome italy nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from both patients were positive for sars-cov-2 by rtpcr assay both patients developed progressive respiratory failure and clinical evidence of severe adult respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation support in the icu11 as it was recommended for compassionate use and in the absence of any clinical trial available at that time we started remdesivir treatment on request from the responsible physicians owing to clinical worsening gilead science inc provided remdesivir and instructions for preparation and administration for intravenous administration the remdesivir dosing regimen was similar to that reported in the ebola clinical trial and therefore was used for 13 days palm consortium study12 the manufacturer-recommended adult dosage and duration of remdesivir were 200 mg loading dose on the first day followed by 12 days of 100 mg once-daily maintenance doses to be administered intravenously over 1 h both patients concluded 13 days of remdesivir treatment despite transient renal impairment in pt1 efficacy and safety evaluations were performed during the study and included virology and clinical laboratory tests haematology serum chemistry vital sign monitoring and physical examinations were evaluated daily monitoring was performed from baseline until the end of treatment blood samples were collected immediately after c0 and at 1 c1 and 24 h c24 after remdesivir intravenous administration on day 3 until day 9 for the determination of plasma concentrations of remdesivir and gs-441524 for compartmental distribution bas samples were collected on days 4 7 and 9 from both patients and a csf sample was obtained on day 7 from pt2 immediately after collection the samples were kept at 4c and subsequently centrifuged and stored at 20c until analysis concentrations of remdesivir and the parent nucleoside analogue gs-441524 were measured in the different matrices using a validated uhplc-msms method13 briefly 50 l of the sample was mixed with 600 l of acetonitrilemethanol 5050 vv containing internal standard three hundred microlitres of supernatant was diluted with 600

load and improved pulmonary function in an animal model of sars-cov and mers-cov infection67 an in vitro study showed that remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 virus in a human cell line5 these data together with the addition of human safety profile data for intravenous remdesivir therapy obtained from a randomized trial in the context of ebola virus disease12 are the basis for the use of intravenous remdesivir as a treatment for covid-19 patients14 we report for the first time remdesivir pk data in covid-19 patients data were obtained from two critically ill chinese patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome11 after intravenous administration in both patients remdesivir showed a peak at the end of infusion and a half-life of 1 h while gs-441524 reached a peak 1 h after infusion and then remained detectable until the next remdesivir administration similar data have been shown in rhesus monkeys after daily intravenous administration of remdesivir which was rapidly converted into the nucleoside analogue gs-441524 and appeared to reach sustained intracellular concentrations of the active triphosphate form above its ec90 for sars-cov5814 furthermore we found higher gs-441524 plasma concentrations in the patient with renal impairment indicating that renal excretion was a major route of elimination there are no specific studies conducted with remdesivir in patients with renal andor hepatic impairment during the palm and meuri protocol no renal or hepatic abnormalities were attributed to remdesivir11 given the benefitrisk calculation in patients with severe sars-cov infection and renal impairment the use of remdesivir should be evaluated nevertheless placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the balance between safety and efficacy in these patients15 remdesivir was undetectable in the compartments evaluated whereas the gs-441524 metabolite was detected in bas but at a lower concentration compared with csf compartment differences in drug exposure could be due to different blood supply or protein binding properties remdesivir has moderate protein binding while gs-441524 exhibits very low protein binding9 which are the major factors influencing drug diffusion in cells and tissue in addition active efflux by different specific protein transporters in lung and in cns such as p-glycoprotein p-gp could potentially be involved91617 remdesivir is a substrate for p-gp while no data are yet available on gs-441524 requiring further studies another hypothesis could be the different drug uptake and metabolism in lung cells where a high number of virus-infected cells are present18 evaluation of the triphosphate form in lung cells is necessary to confirm this hypothesis these preliminary observations increase knowledge about the pk and use of remdesivir for treatment of covid-19 patients however further studies with higher numbers of patients and clinical trials are needed confirm

atsushi okumura tina thomas dana scott tomas cihlar heinz feldmann   to assess the efficacy of remdesivir to alleviate clinical signs of mers-cov infection 18 rhesus macaques were randomly assigned to three groups of six animals three animals in the control group were treated with 1 mlkg vehicle solution 24 h before mers-cov inoculation and three animals were treated at 12 h post mers-cov inoculation another group of six rhesus macaques was treated prophylactically 24 h before mers-cov inoculation with 5 mgkg remdesivir and one group of six animals was treated therapeutically at 12 h postinoculation with mers-cov with 5 mgkg remdesivir treatment was continued once daily until 6 d postinoculation dpi when animals were euthanized and necropsied fig 1 after inoculation with mers-cov on day 0 all animals were closely observed for signs of disease and clinical scores were assigned according to a previously determined scoring sheet all vehicle-treated animals displayed signs of disease starting as early as 1 dpi such as decreased appetite and ruffled fur all vehicle-treated animals had respiratory signs such as increased respiration for 4 n  1 or 5 n  5 d after inoculation the animals treated prophylactically with remdesivir did not show any respiratory signs of disease but decreased appetite possibly due to daily anesthesia was noted in five of six animals the animals treated therapeutically with remdesivir all displayed reduced appetites and five out of six animals had increased respiration rates at 2 n  2 3 n  2 or 4 n  1 d after inoculation these observations are reflected in the clinical scores of the animals with clinical scores in the prophylactically treated animals being statistically significantly lower than in vehicle-treated control animals at 2 to 6 dpi and in the therapeutically treated animals at 2 to 4 dpi fig 2a on days 0 1 3 5 and 6 clinical examinations were performed on the animals and respiration rates were determined on anesthetized animals there was a clear increase in respiration rates in the vehicle-treated animals fig 2b while respiration rates in prophylactically treated animals remained normal throughout the study although respiration rate was increased in therapeutically treated animals at 1 dpi respiration was statistically significantly lower than in vehicle-treated controls at 3 and 6 dpi fig 2b on examination days radiographs were collected from all animals and analyzed for the presence of infiltrates from 3 dpi onward lung infiltrates became visible on x-ray si appendix fig s1 at 6 dpi there was statistically significantly less infiltration in the lungs of animals treated both prophylactically and therapeutically with remdesivir as compared to vehicle-treated control animals fig 2c at 6 dpi all animals were euthanized and respiratory tissues were collected for quantitative analysis of the levels of viral rna by qrt-pcr compared to vehicle-treated control animals prophylactic remdesivir treatment resulted in significantly lower levels of mers-cov replication in the lungs with lung viral loads 25 to 4 logs lower in each lung lobe fig 3a although lung viral loads were on average lower in individual lung lobes after therapeutic treatment this was statistically significant in only a few lung lobes due to larger variation between animals in the therapeutically treated group fig 3a however when all lung lobes were combined the lung viral load in therapeutically treated animals was clearly lower than in vehicle-treated animals fig 3b additionally viral loads were significantly lower in trachea bronchi tonsils and mediastinal lymph nodes of animals treated prophylactically and therapeutically with remdesivir than in vehicle-treated control animals fig 3c and si appendix fig s2 viral rna was not detected in kidney tissue samples si appendix fig s2 upon necropsy the area of each lung lobe affected by gross lesions was estimated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist gross lung lesions were present in several lung lobes of all of the vehicle-treated control animals fig 4a in contrast gross lung lesions were completely absent in the lungs of animals that received prophylactic remdesivir treatment in animals treated therapeutically with remdesivir there were obvious gross lesions present in five out of six animals however the total area of lungs affected by gross lesions was statistically significantly smaller than in vehicle-treated control animals fig 4a in addition the severity of histologic lung lesions was assessed by assigning a score for each lung lobe the resulting cumulative lung histology score was compared between treatment groups to assess differences in the severity of histologic lesions cumulative lung histology scores were significantly lower in animals treated prophylactically with remdesivir fig 4b the large variation between animals in the therapeutically treated group meant that the lower average histology score did not reach statistical significance fig 4b histologically all of the vehicle-treated control animals developed some degree of pulmonary pathology when inoculated with mers-cov lesions were multifocal frequently centered on terminal bronchioles and consisted of minimal to marked interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickening of alveolar septae by edema fluid and fibrin and small to moderate numbers of macrophages and fewer neutrophils alveoli contained moderate numbers of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils in areas with moderate to marked changes there was abundant alveolar edema and fibrin with multifocal formation of hyaline membranes as well as abundant type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia perivascular infiltrates of inflammatory cells multifocally within and adjacent to affected areas of the lung were also observed fig 4c in contrast all animals treated prophylactically with remdesivir had essentially normal pulmonary tissue with no evidence of coronavirus infection fig 4c animals treated with remdesivir therapeutically demonstrated various levels of severity of coronaviral pneumonia in two out of six animals no histologic evidence of pneumonia was detected in three animals multifocal minimal to moderate interstitial pneumonia was observed like that described for the control animals however the lesions were less severe than in the controls and not as widely distributed throughout the lung lobes only one out of six animals had moderate interstitial pneumonia that was indistinguishable from the vehicle-treated control animals in severity and distribution immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of mers-cov antigen showed small numbers of antigen-positive type i pneumocytes in all vehicle-treated control animals and in five out of six animals treated therapeutically with remdesivir there was no difference in number or distribution of antigen-positive cells in animals where antigen was detected mers-cov antigen could not be detected in any of the animals treated prophylactically with remdesivir fig 4d prophylactic remdesivir treatment prevented mers-covinduced clinical disease and lung lesions in rhesus macaques inoculated with mers-cov and strongly inhibited mers-cov replication in respiratory tissues since nosocomial transmission accounts for approximately one-third of mers-cov cases 11 prophylactic remdesivir treatment of patients contacts of patients and healthcare personnel with high-risk exposure to a diagnosed mers patient and at high risk of developing severe mers due to underlying conditions 12 could be considered therapeutic remdesivir treatment also provided a clear clinical benefit with a reduction in clinical signs and virus replication and the absence of lung lesions in two out of six remdesivir-treated animals and a reduction in lesion severity in three additional animals absence of histologic lung lesions as seen in two out of the six animals with therapeutic remdesivir treatment has so far rarely been observed in studies testing the efficacy of mers-cov antivirals in nonhuman primate models 1316 it has only been shown once before in one out of three common marmosets treated with hyperimmune plasma at 6 h after inoculation 17 thus although it is hard to compare different studies due to the fact that different species were used and treatment was initiated at different time points after inoculation remdesivir appears to be one of the most promising antiviral treatments tested in a nonhuman primate model to date therapeutic remdesivir treatment was administered at 12 h after inoculation with mers-cov and although this may seem relatively early after inoculation it is close to the peak of mers-cov replication in the rhesus macaque model 10 a drug that inhibits virus replication may be of little use once virus replication has reached its peak as was shown in vitro 9 however in a considerable number of severe cases of mers viral rna and infectious virus can still be detected in respiratory tract samples several weeks after the onset of symptoms 18 19 with this prolonged virus replication most likely due to the presence of underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus 18 likewise an increase in virus replication over a longer period of time was observed in immunocompromised rhesus macaques 20 thus remdesivir treatment could not only be of benefit to patients diagnosed with mers early after symptom onset but may also improve recovery in those patients with severe cases of mers where prolonged virus replication occurs human safety data are available for remdesivir it has been used on a compassionate basis in several unique cases of ebola virus disease 21 22 as well as on a large scale in the ongoing ebola virus outbreak in the democratic republic of congo 23 with around 400 treated patients in addition its efficacy is currently being tested in a clinical trial in ebola virus disease survivors with prolonged virus shedding 24 25 although the efficacy of remdesivir was lower in the ebola virus trial than that of the different antibody treatments tested survival was increased as compared to overall survival rate in this outbreak taken together the data presented here on the efficacy of remdesivir in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimens the difficulty of coronaviruses to acquire resistance to remdesivir 9 and the availability of human safety data warrant testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a mers clinical trial our results together with replication inhibition by remdesivir of a wide range of coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo 7 may further indicate utility of remdesivir against the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov emerging from wuhan china 26 all animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use

under bsl3 conditions sample inactivation was performed according to ibc-approved standard operating procedures for removal of specimens from high containment to evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on mers-cov disease outcome we used the rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease 10 rhesus macaques were chosen because of the requirement of daily anesthesia and intravenous iv injections that were perceived to be problematic in the alternative nonhuman primate model of mers-cov infection the common marmoset 27 due to their small size all animals were randomly assigned to groups and inoculated as described previously with a total dose of 7  106 tcid50 of mers-cov strain hcov-emc2012 via intranasal oral ocular 1  106 tcid50 each and intratracheal 4  106 tcid50 routes 10 in the first experiment the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir treatment was tested in one group of six rhesus macaques all males female rhesus macaques were not available from the supplier at the time of this study treated with 5 mgkg remdesivir in vehicle solution 5 mgml 12 sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin in water and hydrochloric acid ph35 and three control rhesus macaques all males who received the same volume 1 mlkg of vehicle solution this 5 mgkg dosing in rhesus macaques is roughly equivalent to the 100-mg daily dosing used in humans in the ebola virus clinical trials treatment was initiated at 24 h before virus inoculation and continued once daily until 6 dpi after observing good efficacy of remdesivir upon prophylactic treatment a second experiment was performed to assess its therapeutic efficacy one group of six rhesus macaques all males was treated with 5 mgkg remdesivir and three control rhesus macaques all males received the same volume of vehicle solution due to the acute nature of the mers-cov model in rhesus macaques therapeutic treatment was initiated at 12 h after inoculation with mers-cov and continued once daily until 6 dpi treatment was delivered as a slow iv bolus injection total dose delivered over 5 min administered alternatingly in the left or right cephalic and saphenous veins the animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease using a standardized scoring sheet as described previously 28 the same person who was blinded to the group assignment of the animals assessed

pneumonia of unknown cause on 7th january 2020 a previously unidentified betacoronavirus later named sars-cov-2 virus or the disease named covid-19 was identified by the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc as the aetiological agent 1 the sars-cov-2 probably derived originally from bats and amongst coronaviruses known to infect humans is most closely related to but distinct from the sars coronavirus the clinical manifestations of covid-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection mild upper respiratory symptoms severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death although the risk of severe illness is not yet clear hospitals in areas with significant community transmission have experienced a major increase in the number of hospitalized pneumonia patients with the frequency of severe disease in hospitalized patients being as high as 30 24 the progression from prodromes usually fever fatigue and cough to severe pneumonia requiring oxygen support mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo is most commonly seen in the second week following onset of symptoms of a viral infection 2 the kinetics of viral replication in the respiratory tract has not been well characterized but this relatively slow progression provides a potential time window and opportunity for antiviral therapies to influence the course of the disease remdesivir gs-5734 is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue gs-441524 and has broad action against a range of rna viruses 5 it has been identified as the most promising therapeutic agent for evaluation in the treatment of covid-19 by an expert committee convened by the who rd blueprint 6 the primary mechanism of action is the intracellular incorporation of the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate form into nascent rna chains by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase causing premature rna chain termination 79 in vitro experiments have shown that remdesivir inhibits bat coronaviruses endemic human coronavirus oc43 229e and the human pathogenic coronaviruses mers-cov sars-cov and covid-19 1013 remdesivir has shown preventive and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of sars-cov 10 in a mers-cov mouse model prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir improved lung function decreased lung viral load and reduced severe lung pathological findings 14 remdesivir has also shown prophylactic efficacy in mers-cov-infected indian rhesus monkeys personal communication gilead sciences inc evaluation of intravenously administered remdesivir tolerance and safety in 94 healthy adult volunteers has found it to be generally well tolerated and to have an acceptable safety profile the only significant adverse effects were transient grade 1 or grade 2 increases in aspartate transaminase ast and alanine transaminase alt personal communication gilead sciences inc further clinical experience was obtained through a randomized controlled trial in patients with ebola virus disease in this trial 175 patients received intravenous remdesivir with a loading dose on day 1 200 mg in adults and adjusted for body weight in pediatric patients followed by a daily maintenance dose 100 mg in adults starting on day 2 and continuing for 9 to 13 days the only reported serious adverse event sae was that of one patient who experienced hypotension that resulted in cessation of the remdesivir loading dose followed rapidly by cardiac arrest however the cause of death could not be distinguished from the patients underlying severe ebola virus disease 15 given the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of remdesivir against a range of pathogenic human coronaviruses and the acceptable tolerance and safety in humans we developed this trial with the objective of evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous remdesivir in adults with severe covid-19 this is a phase 3 parallel group randomized double-blind

data and emerging clinical experience for covid- 19 running title review of remdesivir for covid-19 sarah cj jorgensen 1 razieh kebriaei linda dresser d affiliations  sarah jorgensen c j  the global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has created an urgent need for effective antivirals remdesivir formerly gs-5734 is a nucleoside analogue pro-drug currently being evaluated in covid-19 clinical trials its unique structural features allow high concentrations of the this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved active triphosphate metabolite to be delivered intracellularly and it evades proofreading to successfully inhibit viral rna synthesis in pre-clinical models remdesivir has demonstrated potent antiviral activity against diverse human and zoonotic -coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 in this article we critically review available data on remdesivir with an emphasis on biochemistry pharmacology pharmacokinetics and in vitro activity against coronaviruses as well as clinical experience and current progress in covid-19 clinical trials drug administration fda remdesivir formerly gs-5734 figure 1  is a phosphoramidate pro-drug of a 1-cyano-substituted nucleoside analogue gs-441524 it inhibits viral replication by competing with endogenous nucleotides for incorporation into replicating viral rna via rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp 6 the rdrp non-structural protein nsp12 is highly conserved across coronaviruses making it an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs once inside cells remdesivir undergoes rapid metabolic conversion by intracellular kinases to its active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite gs-443902 in general the rate limiting step for activation of nucleoside analogues is the generation the nucleoside monophosphate 6 nucleoside phosphoramidates like remdesivir and gs-441524 are bioisoteres of monophosphates and are thereby able to bypass this rate-limiting step 6 nucleoside phosphoramidates however must be administered as pro-drugs to mask the charged phosphonate group and allow faster cell entry in the case of remdesivir the negative charge is masked by the 2ethylbutyl and l-alanine groups which are rapidly removed by intracellular esterases in addition the 1-cn group on remdesivir and its metabolites confers high selectivity for rdrp compared to human polymerases  figure 1  6  the global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has created an urgent need for effective antivirals 1 2 a wide variety of novel and repurposed agents are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and anecdotal reports of off-label and compassionate use of a number of these agents have emerged 3 4 remdesivir formerly gs-5734 is a monophosphoramidate nucleoside analogue prodrug that was originally developed in response to the 2014 -2016 ebola outbreak in west africa 5 6 ribavirin against coronaviruses for example has been attributed to its removal by exon 11 remdesivir is more active against viruses lacking exon but is able to partly evade proofreading and maintain potent antiviral activity in the presence of exon this was nicely illustrated in a coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv model 11 compared to wild-type mhv ec 50 0087 m viruses lacking exon were approximately 4-fold more sensitive to remdesivir inhibition ec 50 0019 m the reason remdesivirs activity is only modestly decreased by exon relates to two unique properties first remdesivir is incorporated into replicating rna more efficiently than natural nucleotides 10 12 13 this was shown in a series of kinetic studies that determined the selectivity of coronaviruses for remdesivir vs natural nucleotides 10 12 in this context selectivity was defined as the ratio of the parameters vmax reflecting the maximal velocity of nucleotide incorporation to km interestingly selectivity values were higher for ebola virus 4 and for other nucleotide analogues with sars-cov-2 favipiravir  570 and ribavirin  1000 10 the second reason that remdesivir is able to partly evade exon is because it functions as a nonobligate or delayed rna chain terminator 10 12 13 delayed chain termination occurs when a nucleotide analogue has a free 3-oh group required for the addition of natural nucleotides the incorporation of the delayed chain terminator however perturbs the rna structure and synthesis is halted at some point downstream 13 in sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and mers-cov remdesivir gs-443902 incorporation consistently results in chain termination after three additional nucleotides are added 10 12 it is thought that these nucleotides provide protection from exon excision 10 12  as described in the chemistry and pharmacology section remdesivir is a pro-drug concentrations decline rapidly after iv administration plasma half-life t   1 hour followed by the sequential appearance of the intermediate alanine metabolite gs-704277 and the nucleoside monophosphate metabolite gs-441524 plasma t  245 hours  figure 1  inside cells gs-441524 is rapidly converted to the pharmacologically active triphosphate analogue gs-443902 which has a prolonged intracellular t  peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc t   40 hours both remdesivir and gs-441524 exhibit linear pk following single doses between 3 mg and 225 mg and no remdesivir accepted article accumulation was observed following once daily dosing for up to 5 days by contrast gs-441524 reaches steady state around day 4 and accumulates by  2-fold after multiple once daily dosing 3 the remdesivir dosing regimen being evaluated in clinical trials 200 mg iv on day 1 then 100 mg iv on days 2 through 5 or 10 was substantiated by in vitro data and bridging the pk with the rhesus monkey experience to humans 7 8 14 table 1 summarizes pertinent pk parameters of remdesivir and metabolite gs-441524 which were derived from single and multiple-dose studies in healthy human adult volunteers 14 as shown remdesivir c max values are many fold above concentrations required in vitro to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication by 50 and 90 ec 50 0137 -077 m ec 90 176 m see microbiology section 14 15 due to the near complete first pass effect of phosphoramidates remdesivir is expected to have poor oral bioavailability 6 plasma protein binding for remdesivir is moderate free fraction of 121 by contrast metabolites gs-704277 and gs-441524 exhibit low plasma protein binding with mean free fractions  85 14 in cynomolgus monkeys radiolabeled remdesivir or its metabolites were detectable in the testes epididymis eyes and brain 4 hours after a 10 mgkg dose equivalent to 200 mg in humans 16 levels in the brain were significantly lower than other tissues but accumulated over time 16 distribution studies in humans have not yet been reported remdesivir is a substrate of several cytochrome p450 enzymes in vitro see drug interactions section however clinical implications are unclear since the pro-drug is rapidly metabolized by plasma hydrolases 14 by similar reasoning the effect of hepatic impairment on remdesivir plasma levels should be low although specific studies have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment and the drug is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment 14 metabolism of metabolites gs-704277 gs-441524 and gs-443902 has not been characterized remdesivir exhibits low renal excretion  10 however 49 of a radiolabeled dose was recovered as gs-441524 in urine 14 theoretically plasma exposure of gs-441524 may be increased in patients with renal impairment remdesivir formulations contain sulfobutylether -cyclodextrin sodium sbecd as a solubility enhancer 14 formulations containing sbecd have historically been cautioned against in patients with renal impairment although clinical data suggest sbecd accumulation does not increase the risk of acute kidney injury 17 there are no recommendations for dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment at this time under the fda emergency use authorization guidance remdesivir is not recommended in patients with an estimated accepted article glomerular filtration rate egfr  30 mlmin or serum creatinine  1 mgdl unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 18 patients with an egfr  30 mlmin and those who are receiving hemodialysis or hemofiltration are excluded from the ema compassionate use program 14 there are no pk data available for children or women who are pregnant or breast feeding remdesivir has demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against a diverse panel of zoonotic and clinically relevant human coronaviruses including sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and mers-cov with micromolar ec 50 or ic 50 values in multiple in vitro systems 3 9 11 19 20 in human airway epithelial cell cultures for example remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-1 and mers-cov replication with ic 50 values of 0069 and 0074 m respectively 9 emerging data suggests remdesivir also exhibits potent activity against sars-cov-2 14 15 21 in testing performed by the chinese cdc in collaboration with the manufacturer gilead sciences inc using vero e6 cells a cell line from green monkey kidney epithelial cells that is commonly used to evaluate antiviral activity the ec 50 value was 0137 m against sars-cov-2 14 14 15 in this study viral load was fitted in logarithm scales log 10 tcid 50 ml and log 10 viral rna copiesml using this scale ec 50 values were many fold higher at 2315 m and 2690 m respectively 21 it is uncertain which method is most reflective of activity in vivo it should also be remembered that ec 50 and ic 50 values represent a single point on the dose-response curve and the slope of the curve may be more important when evaluating potency 22 this relationship is generally neglected when assessing in vitro antiviral activity furthermore clinical outcomes may depend on whether  90 inhibition is achieved but ec 90 values are reported in a minority of studies it is reassuring that the ec 90 value reported by wang and colleagues 176 m is achievable with the dosing regimen under evaluation see pk section 14 15 the development of remdesivir resistance in coronaviruses has been assessed by cell culture in mhv which has similar ec 50 values to sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and mers-cov 11 following  20 accepted article in vitro passages two nonsynonymous mutations were selected in the nsp12 rdrp f476l and v553l neither of the mutations directly altered rdrps catalytic site or substrate binding pocket but they did cause minor structural alterations that are thought to impact rdrps fidelity checking step before catalysis 11 13 compared to wild-type virus these mutations conferred 24-fold and 5-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir respectively while the double mutant showed 56-fold reduced susceptibility in vitro 11 the ec 50 values of the mutants 0057 -013 m however remained below achievable human drug exposures 3 11 13 furthermore the mutations appear to confer a fitness cost with wild-type virus rapidly outcompeting the mutants in the absence of remdesivir of concern however the affected residues are conserved across coronaviruses raising the possibility of a common pathway to resistance in fact substitutions at homologous sars-cov-1 residues conferred a 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to remdesivir ec 50 001 m  006 m 11 no data specific to sars-cov-2 remdesivir resistance have been published at the time of writing remdesivirs efficacy against respiratory diseases caused by -coronaviruses has been evaluated in both rodent and rhesus monkey models 7-9 14 19 before summarizing these studies the reader should be aware that rodent models are not ideal for evaluating remdesivir efficacy against -coronaviruses first high levels of serum esterases rapidly degrade the pro-drug t   5 minutes 9 16 investigators have attempted to overcome this by using esterase knock-out mice 9 this improves plasma stability t  25 minutes but tissue levels of active metabolites are still  10-fold lower 9 second the active triphosphate metabolite gs-443902 has a significantly shorter t  in the mouse lung 3 hours compared to human lung cells and nonhuman primate lungs t  20 -40 hours 9 14 finally mice are naturally resistant to infection by mers-cov due to the inability of the spike protein binding domain to interact with the mouse dpp4 receptor therefore transgenic mice harboring a modified humanized dpp4 must be used 19 these limitations notwithstanding sheahan and colleagues evaluated prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir against sars-cov-1 in an esterase-deficient mouse model 9 compared to control mice prophylactic administration of remdesivir 24 hours before viral inoculation resulted in less weight loss lower viral lung titers and reduced sars-cov-1-induced lung pathology 9 similarly therapeutic remdesivir administered 1 day post-inoculation significantly diminished weight loss and viral load and improved pulmonary function although to a lesser degree than the prophylactic regimen when this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved remdesivir was initiated 2 days post-infection however it did not improve disease outcomes even though viral lung titers were reduced the disease course in mice is accelerated compared to humans with viral titers peaking around day 2 concurrent with maximal damage to lungs the same group of investigators conducted a similar study evaluating remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir -interferon- against mers-cov in an esterase-deficient humanized ddp4 mouse model 19 prophylactic remdesivir significantly improved mers-cov-induced weight loss decreased viral lung titers and diminished features of acute lung injury compared to control mice it also prevented mortality in mice administered a lethal dose of virus in contrast prophylactic lopinavirritonavir -interferon- slightly reduced viral loads but had no impact on other disease outcomes therapeutic remdesivir also led to improved disease outcomes and lower viral loads but again the effect size was diminished compared to prophylactic administration remdesivir administered after a lethal viral dose was given as opposed to before with prophylaxis did not prevent mortality 19 the prophylactic andor therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir has been evaluated in mers-cov-infected and sars-cov-2-infected rhesus monkeys these models more accurately recapitulate the lung disease observed in humans with mild-moderate mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infection compared to rodent models 23 24 dosing and pharmacokinetic analyses can also serve as a bridge to human dosing regimens 7 however due to the acute and accelerated infection course in monkeys it is difficult to directly translate the timing of drug initiation to corresponding disease stages in humans 23 24 furthermore neither model replicates many of the extrapulmonary disease manifestation seen in humans 23 24 in the mers-cov study monkeys were administered remdesivir 5mgkg which approximates drug exposures equivalent to 100mg in humans 24 hours before mers-cov inoculation prophylaxis or 12 hours post-inoculation treatment 8 viral titers peak shortly after 12 hours in this model for both groups remdesivir was continued once daily until 6 days post-inoculation prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment significantly reduced mers-cov-induced clinical signs viral titers in respiratory specimens and the severity of lung lesions compared to control animals these effects were most pronounced in the prophylactic group 8 a similar prophylactic study was conducted using a higher remdesivir dose 10mgkg which approximates drug exposures equivalent to 200mg in humans 14 clinical signs and viral loads were significantly reduced vs controls increases in serum accepted article creatinine and blood urea nitrogen suggestive of altered renal function were only observed in remdesivir treated animals 14 in the sars-cov-2 study remdesivir was again initiated shortly before viral titers are expected to peak at 12 hours post-inoculation and a dosing regimen equivalent to the regimen being tested in human covid-19 clinical trials was used 10 mgkg load  200 mg in humans then 5 mgkg daily  100mg daily in humans x 6 days 7 compared to vehicle-treated monkeys remdesivir-treated monkeys had improved clinical and radiographic outcomes viral titers were reduced in lower respiratory tract specimens and undetectable at 3 days post inoculation viral titers were not reduced in upper respiratory tract specimens nor in rectal swabs however 7 if translated in humans the absence of a reduction in viral shedding in these sites may have implications for potential transmission risk following clinical improvement 7 initial experience with remdesivir in patients with covid-19 emerged in the form of case reports and uncontrolled case series as detailed in table 2  3 25 26 27 28 29 all patients in these reports received remdesivir through compassionate use or expanded access programs 14 30 the largest report included 61 patients from centers in north america europe and japan 3 all patients were hospitalized with microbiologically confirmed covid-19 and had an oxygen saturation  94 on room air or required oxygen support those with severe renal impairment elevated hepatic enzymes or receiving another investigational agent at baseline were excluded of the 53 patients with short-term follow-up data available 30 56 were receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline and a further 4 8 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo remdesivir was started at a median of 12 days following symptom onset after a median follow-up of 18 days 7 13 patients died including 6 18 who were receiving invasive ventilation adverse events were reported in 32 60 patients including 12 23 who experienced at least one serious adverse event the most frequent adverse events were hepatic enzyme elevations diarrhea rash renal impairment and hypotension the publication of this report generated a great deal of controversy the authors rightly acknowledge many of its limitations including the small sample size the short duration of follow-up missing data and the absence of a control group 3 the lack of post day 1 data on 7 patients is particularly concerning and not adequately addressed in the publication in addition a target sample size was not reported nor was a rationale given for why the data were analyzed and reported at the point they were it is unclear how many physicians applied for compassionate use for their patients but were denied it would be interesting to know how these patients differed from the small number whose request for remdesivir was approved finally preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir has little benefit when administered after the peak in viral replication has occurred 7-9 14 19 although the precise timing of peak viral loads was not accessed in these patients it may be problematic to attribute favorable outcomes to the remdesivir when initiation was delayed beyond 12 days for many patients against this backdrop the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating remdesivir for covid-19 was recently published 31 in this study 237 hospitalized adults with severe covid-19 were enrolled at 10 centers in wuhan hubei china and randomized 21 to remdesivir or matching placebo for a planned 10-day treatment course 200mg iv day 1 100mg iv daily on days 2 to 10 severe covid-19 was defined as a sars-cov-2 positive respiratory specimen by rt-pcr pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging and an oxygen saturation  94 on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen  300mmhg the primary outcome was time to clinical improvement defined as discharge alive from hospital or a 2-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal scale adapted from the world health organizations 8-point illness severity scale 32 the study was stopped before reaching its target sample size of 453 due to slow enrollment baseline characteristics were similar between groups the median duration of illness before enrollment was 10 days and most patients 82 required only low-flow supplemental oxygen at baseline 31 use of antibiotics 91 and corticosteroids 66 were high in both groups in addition 28 and 32 of patients received lopinavirritonavir andor interferon-2 respectively during the course of their illness with regards to the primary outcome there was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement between the remdesivir and placebo groups   this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved adequately powered clinical trials or meta-analyses considering remdesivirs potent in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 and impressive results in pre-clinical models one of the most unexpected findings in this study was that remdesivir had no impact on viral load it is plausible that the delayed time to administration may have played a role on the other hand in vitro activity and animal data often do not translate into meaningful benefit for patients 5 33 34 strengths of this study include its randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design high protocol adherence and low loss to follow-up 31 premature termination however leaves an underpowered study with inconclusive results although cautious of over-interpretation the point estimate for the primary outcome hr 123 suggests any benefit of remdesivir may be more modest than hoped for hr 140 and the small difference in favor of remdesivir for the composite primary outcome appeared to be driven largely by change in oxygenation status rather than the more clinically meaningful hospital discharge as discussed in the safety section this study did give valuable data to help better characterize the adverse effect profile of remdesivir on the same day that the peer-reviewed publication of the study by wang and colleagues was released partial results of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases sponsored adaptive covid-19 trial actt-1 were made public in a press release 31 actt-1 was a randomized double-blind placebo-control study evaluating remdesivir 200mg iv day 1 then 100mg iv days 2 to 10 in hospitalized adult patients with covid-19 the primary endpoint which was changed 9 days before the independent data safety monitoring board meet to review the results announced in the press release was time to recovery within 28 days after randomization using a 3point ordinal scale after 606 recovery events the median time to recovery was 11 days in the remdesivir group vs 15 days in the placebo group hr 131 95 ci 112 to 154 mortality was numerically but not statistically lower in the remdesivir group 80 vs 116 p  0059 31 in a second statement gilead announced that similar outcomes had been demonstrated in their open-label multicenter clinical trial of 5 vs 10 days of remdesivir in patients with covid-19 not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ecmo 35 more comprehensive data about these studies is anticipated as of 5 may 2020 there are 10 clinical studies underway and registered on clinicaltrialsgov including 6 randomized-controlled trials the full results of which are eagerly awaited 36 table 3  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved information on the safety profile of remdesivir is rapidly evolving until recently most clinical experience has been in patients with ebola virus infection which has very different clinical manifestations compared to covid-19 making extrapolation of drug safety across populations problematic 5 14 in the palm study 9 of 175 patients who received remdesivir for ebola virus infection experienced serious adverse events judged by trial investigators to be potentially related to remdesivir 5 the most serious of these was hypotension during the loading dose rapidly followed by cardiac arrest and death 5 among 38 ebola virus infection survivors who were enrolled in the single arm phase ii prevail iv study 1 patient required a remdesivir dose reduction due to transaminase elevations 14 safety data from four phase 1 pk studies in healthy volunteers has also been partly reported 3 23 in these studies subjects received single remdesivir doses of up to 225mg or multiple doses of 150mg once daily for 7 or 14 days or 200mg once followed by 100mg daily for a total of 5 or 10 days the most common adverse events recorded in at least 5 subjects were phlebitis constipation headache ecchymosis nausea and extremity pain 3 transient asymptomatic grade 1 or 2 alanine aminotransferase alt elevations were observed in most subjects exact frequency not reported in the multi-dose pk studies including 1 individual with alt values  10 x baseline 3 23 transaminase increases have also been reported in covid-19 patients treated with compassionate use remdesivir table 2 3 23 26 28 in the report detailing the first 12 covid-19 cases in the us all 3 patients who received remdesivir experienced transient transaminase elevations and gastrointestinal symptoms 26 in addition one patient in the case series from france experienced alt elevation to 3 times the upper limit of normal and a maculopapular rash leading to remdesivir discontinuation 4 days following the first dose 28 the fda reports that among 163 patients enrolled in the compassionate use program the overall incidence of liver function test abnormalities was 117 23 seven cases were considered serious the time to onset from first dose ranged from 1 to 16 days with the exception of 1 case of seriously elevated bilirubin none of the other cases had associated hyperbilirubinemia or symptoms of hepatitis 23 in the rct reported by wang and colleagues adverse effects were recorded in 66 of patients randomized to remdesivir of which 8 were grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia n 4 hypokalemia n2 hyperkalemia n  2 anemia n1 increased total bilirubin n  1  31 the incidence and distribution of adverse effects was similar in the placebo group aspartate aminotransferase ast elevations were observed in 5 of patients in the remdesivir arm compared to 12 in the placebo arm no patients in accepted article either arm experienced grade 3 or 4 transaminase elevations more patients in the remdesivir discontinued treatment prematurely 12 vs 5 with respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome being the most common event leading to drug discontinuation in the remdesivir group in a summary of safety data reported by the fda from the a remdesivir clinical trial comparing 5 and 10day treatment courses in patients with covid-19 grade 3 and 4 alt andor ast elevations occurred in 7 patients elevations in bilirubin were uncommon 13 23 at this time it is unclear if the liver enzyme abnormalities seen in patients receiving remdesivir for covid-19 are a component of the infectious process or due to the drug the fact that abnormalities albeit less severe were seen in healthy volunteers suggests remdesivir is at least partly culpable whether asymptomatic abnormalities are harbingers of more serious liver toxicity is also unknown other approved nucleoside analogues including those used to treat hiv hepatitis b and cytomegalovirus are known to cause liver injury by a variety of mechanisms 24 the most common involves inhibition of mitochondrial dna synthesis leading to mitochondria depletion or dysfunction first generation hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitors are thought to cause hepatic injury by this mechanism mitochondrial dysfunction can affect multiple tissues manifesting as myopathy neuropathy pancreatitis bone marrow suppression andor hepatic injury 24 extra-hepatic manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction have not been reported in patients exposed to remdesivir to date nucleoside analogues may also cause liver injury through acute hypersensitivity reactions or the production of toxic intermediates 24 these reactions tend to be idiosyncratic and uncommon whereas transaminase elevations are consistently observed in a minority of remdesivir treated patients a fulsome safety assessment of remdesivir will require thorough review of data from recently completed and ongoing studies in addition to post-marketing surveillance and real-world experience at the time of writing no in vivo drug interaction studies of remdesivir have been published but the ability of remdesivir to inhibit or induce cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes and transporters has been tested in vitro 14 importantly however as a pro-drug remdesivir is rapidly degraded in vivo so the potential for clinically significant drug interactions is likely limited 14 data on the potential for remdesivir metabolites to perpetrate drug interactions is even scarcer in in vitro studies remdesivir was a weak inhibitor of cyp1a2 cyp2c9 cyp2c19 and cyp2d6 14 remdesivirs ic 50 for cyp3a was 16 m suggesting inhibition may occur briefly with standard human exposures inhibition of accepted article cyp450 enzymes by metabolites was not investigated 14 tests of remdesivir cyp450 induction have been inconsistent it may induce cyp1a2 and cyp2b6 14 again the clinical importance of this is questionable gs-441524 and gs-704277 demonstrated no cyp450 induction in these studies remdesivir was found to be a substrate oatp1b p-glycoprotein or inhibitor oat1b1 oat1b3 of several drug transporters 14 there are no exclusion criteria related to drug-drug interactions in current remdesivir clinical studies table 3  remdesivir is available in 2 bioequivalent

are no therapies that have been scientifically proven to improve mortality in covid- 19  current management is largely focused on supportive care and prevention of complications 37 38 efficacious and safe antiviral agents are therefore urgently needed to relieve the burden on healthcare systems as detailed in this review remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue pro-drug with unique structural features that allow high concentrations of the active triphosphate metabolite to be delivered intracellularly 6 it evades proofreading to successfully inhibit viral rna synthesis and has demonstrated potent antiviral activity against -coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 both in vitro and in animal models 7-12 15 19 20 these data coupled with early safety data from clinical experience in ebola virus infection 5  provide strong rationale for prioritizing testing of remdesivir in covid-19 clinical trials the unpredictable nature of a pandemic however poses many challenges to researchers attempting to conduct clinical trials 39 the first randomized controlled trial evaluating remdesivir for covid-19 was conducted a multiple sites in the initial outbreak epicenter yet it failed this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved to meet its target sample size due to slow enrollment after the surge in cases diminished and it produced inconclusive results when patient enrollment in clinical trials is not available many clinicians face intense pressure to offer unproven therapies based on compelling pre-clinical data as of april 30 2020 more than 2000 patients with covid-19 have received remdesivir through compassionate use or expanded access programs 35 it is impossible to know if these patients benefited or were harmed but we do know these programs do little to advance science efforts must focus on ensuring the necessary infrastructure is in place to expand patient access to pragmatic clinical trials and make it simple for clinicians to enroll them this could obviate the need for compassionate use programs with at least 6 remdesivir randomized-controlled trials currently underway worldwide there is reason to be optimistic that we will accumulate good data

 the selection of medications in this review is based the 7th edition of covid-19 diagnosis and treatment guideline issued by the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china table 2
 and relevant clinical studies although there are few published rcts on sars-cov-2 the novel virus is found to share 79 genome sequence with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and about 50 with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov while manifesting overlapping pathogenesis 45 relevant in vitro researches animal models and clinical evidence in all coronaviruses and reviewed by june 12
thjune 23th 2020 in order to gain insights on the potential role of these medication therapies in combating covid-19 data for this review were identified by searches of pubmed and references from relevant articles using the search terms medication name and sars-cov-2 coronavirus covid-19 only articles published in english and chinese speaking languages of the authors were included patients-based clinical data when available were given priority over in vitro and in vivo data randomized controlled trials when available were given priority over other studies remdesivir gs-5734 is an investigational drug first developed for the treatment of ebola 67 as an adenosine analogue prodrug it putatively disrupts viral rna transcription and is viewed as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent 891011 profoundly remdesivir has exhibited mechanisms to overcome drug resistance and genetic mutations in coronavirus 11 patients with severe renal impairment egfr 30 mlmin173 or severe liver disease are excluded from receiving remdesivir 121314 remdesivir is generally well tolerated with possible adverse effects of nausea liver enzyme elevation hypotension and respiratory failure 671314 in a

loads had been downward trending even before remdesivir treatment it therefore cannot be determined if further viral load decrease and clinical improvement were a direct result of remdesivir a case series of remdesivir compassionate use n53 reported 68 improved oxygenation 47 discharge and 13 death the study was weakened by many factors including most significantly the lack of a paired control group 12 a double-blinded rct in china n237 revealed no superiority of remdesivir over placebo in time to clinical recovery 28-day mortality and viral clearance 13 on average remdesivir was initiated 11 days post symptom onset likely past the peak of viral replication as covid-19 surge passed in china the trial only recruited 50 of target sample size reducing statistical power simple a phase 3 open-label rct revealed that remdesivir 5-day vs 10-day regimens of 200 mg once followed by 100 mg iv daily produced similar outcomes the group that started remdesivir early 10 days of symptoms onset had a higher discharge rate on day 14 62 vs 49 the national institutes of health nih recently released preliminary result analysis of the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial actt n1063 18 in this rct remdesivir arm had 31 faster time to recovery than the placebo group p0001 mortality rate was also reduced in remdesivir group but not statistically significant 8 vs 116 p0059 the forthcoming full publication might reveal whether the promising outcomes were associated with early administration of remdesivir as suggested by previous studies by far remdesivir has not shown significant mortality benefit when initiated early remdesivir appears to expedite recovery as an investigative drug on incomplete trials remdesivir is neither recommended nor disapproved by chinas nhc and who 1920 currently remdesivir is recommended by the nih for hospitalized severe covid-19 cases as defined by oxygenation needs 21 ribavirin is a nucleoside analog which has antiviral activity against multiple rna viruses including respiratory syncytial virus sars-cov and mers-cov by interfering with rna polymerase and viral protein synthesis 2829 the most severe adverse effects are hemolytic anemia and leukopenia other adverse effects include fatigue pruritus rash and gout ribavirin is a notorious teratogenic drug and is contraindicated in pregnancy 2829 ribavirin with or without the concomitant use of steroids was used extensively during the 2013 sars outbreak in vitro tests showed that ribavirin inhibited a  coronavirus at relatively high concentration 30 however when using ribavirin with interferon-2b combined lower concentrations of ribavirin inhibited viral replication in vero cell lines 30 a prospective uncontrolled study evaluated clinical outcomes of ribavirin and corticosteroids in 132 patients with suspected sars when fever was not resolved after 48 hours of hospital admission twenty-five patients 181 responded to ribavirin and corticosteroids and two of those patients received ribavirin iv 31 approximately 49 to 59 of patients treated with ribavirin had a reduction in hemoglobin of more than 2 gdl from baseline 36 to 76 had evidence of hemolytic anemia and 40 experienced elevation of transaminases 3132 in a phase 2 open-label covid-19 trial which enrolled 127 patients from 6 hong kong hospitals hung and his colleagues compared triple therapy

19 it is not evaluated by the nih 21 interferon ifn induces several parallel antiviral pathways by triggering viral rna degradation rna transcription alteration protein synthesis inhibition and apoptosis 34 the common side effects include flu-like symptoms and mood changes 35 it is contraindicated in patients with decompensated liver disease severe autoimmune disease worsening psychiatric conditions cytopenia and uncontrolled seizures 35 during the sars and mers outbreaks interferon was widely used for its antiviral effects after showing in vitro efficacy 4243 an open-label uncontrolled retrospective study on sars showed that the addition of alfacon-1 ifn- to corticosteroids was associated with faster lung recovery and shorter intubation time compared to corticosteroids alone 36 similarly a randomized 4-arm open-label retrospective study on sars in guangzhou china demonstrated that ifn plus high dose steroid therapy achieved respiratory improvement faster resolution of pulmonary infiltrates and less need for mv 37 moreover ifn combined with ribavirin was correlated with neither a faster viral clearance nor an improved survival rate in older 50 years old critically-ill patients with comorbidities 383941 in vitro data of interferon activity against sars-cov-2 suggested that the ec50 in vero cells of ifn- and ifn- treatment is 135 iuml and 076 iuml respectively 44 this data may provide some evidence for clinical application of ifn therapy in covid-19 considering the risk of spreading infectious aerosol uncertainty of pharmacokinetics in nebulization and lack of clinical data it is difficult to justify the ifn inhalation therapy for the treatment of covid-19 at this point rcts on ifn are required to evaluate its efficacy in covid-19 chinas nhc recommended ifn nebulization as an antiviral option for covid-19 presumptively at the beginning of the pandemic table 2 19 the nih recommends against the use of ifn 21 corticosteroids are a type of anti-inflammatory medication that is effective in treatment of a variety of conditions such as asthma allergic conditions autoimmune diseases septic shock and cancers 45 corticosteroids are a double-edged sword since while these agents inhibit inflammation they also impair immune response and increase the risk of infection the adverse effects vary depending on the dosage and duration of therapy these side effects include hyperglycemia abdominal obesity infection mood swing osteoporosis growth retardation glaucoma and hypertension 45 a systematic review of steroids administered to patients with sars reported no survival benefit and possible harm including avascular necrosis psychosis diabetes and delayed viral clearance 46 another study of patients receiving corticosteroids for mers found no benefit in mortality but delayed lower respiratory tract clearance of the virus 47 since the outbreak of covid-19 corticosteroid treatment has been used in up to 45 of infected patients in china 48 49 one retrospective observational study showed 72 of the icu patients with covid-19 received glucocorticoid therapy 48 in covid-19 patients with ards treatment with steroids is associated with decreased risk of death compared to the patients who did not receive steroids 46 vs 618 50 however the existing evidence regarding the use of steroids in this specific patient population remains inconclusive due to methodological limitations based on the previous data on other clades of coronavirus the who and nih generally recommend glucocorticoids not to be used in covid-19 pneumonia unless there are other indications eg exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ards 2021 however some front-line physicians in china have a different perspective they recommend short courses 7 days of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses 05-1 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent be used judiciously for critically ill patients with covid-19 pneumonia 5152 according to chinas nhc systemic glucocorticoids should be used with caution and the routine use should be avoided 19 short-term methylprednisolone can be administered for patients with rapid disease progression or severe illness and the recommended dose should not exceed 1-2mgkgday notably the guideline mentions that high doses of corticosteroids may delay viral clearance due to their inhibitory effects on the immune system the benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated for patients with hypoxemia or who take corticosteroids regularly for chronic diseases corticosteroids should be used cautiously 52 the society of critical care medicine sccm suggests using low-dose corticosteroid therapy for the covid-19 patients with refractory shock in mechanically ventilated patients with covid-19 and respiratory failure without ards sccm recommends against the routine use of systemic corticosteroids 53 as of now the use of corticosteroids to reduce cytokine-related pulmonary damage in patients with covid-19 pneumonia is controversial robust evidence from well-designed clinical trials is needed for the recommendation of corticosteroid treatment in covid-19 patients who developed different complications intravenous immunoglobulin ivig is a product of human immunoglobulins derived from plasma indicated for various immunodeficiencies autoimmune and inflammatory disorders 54 55 ivig has potent immune replacement and immune modulating effects via complex pathways 55 in addition ivig has anti-inflammatory properties and can neutralize bacterial toxins 56 the most common adverse reactions of ivig are headache fever and tachycardia 55 currently there is no solid clinical evidence to support the use of ivig in coronaviruses several animal studies found that equine and bovine-produced human immune antibodies can reduce viral titers and accelerate viral clearance of mers-cov in mouse models 57 during the 2013 sars epidemic observational studies and case reports described ivig for the treatment of critically ill patients in combination with antiviral therapies in a clinical review on sars ivig was used with interferon in all critically ill patients n120 the authors concluded that there was no significant benefit 36 in another prospective observational study ivig was used in sars patients with severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and it appeared to be effective for controlling cytopenia by increasing leukocyte and platelet counts however without a control group ivigs role in sars treatment remains undetermined 58 since the outbreak of covid-19 in china clinicians have used ivig in patients infected with sars-cov-2 based on extrapolated ivig data from sars and mers in a descriptive study of covid-19 27 of 99 patients received ivig but the efficacy and safety of ivig in was not addressed in this study 47 several observational case reports suggest that high dose ivig at the early stage of clinical deterioration may improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe symptoms 5960 the small number of patients with heterogeneous clinical status and the use of other medications or therapies with unapproved efficacy leads to inconclusive results there are several ongoing trials initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivig for treatment of covid-19 to date there is no completed randomized control trial demonstrating its efficacy chinas nhc does not provide any recommendations on the use of ivig 19 the nih covid-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends against the use of non-sars-cov-2-specific ivig for the treatment of covid-19 except in the context of a clinical trial or indicated complications 21 xuebijing xbj is a widely used traditional herbal medicine in china for its anti-inflammatory and anti-endotoxin effects 6162 it is a five-herbal combination carthamus tinctorius radix paeoniae rubra ligusticum wallichii salvia miltirrhiza and angelica sinensis the common side effects include infusion reactions of rash tachycardia hypotension and gi discomforts including nausea vomiting abdominal pain andor diarrhea 6162 in a meta-analysis of case-control studies on sepsis xbj significantly reduced 28-day mortality and improved clinical parameters including the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score apache ii wbc c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin and body temperature 61 that being said the efficacy of xbj in sepsis needs to be confirmed in a rct the current clinical data on xbj in ards are inconsistent one rct showed reduction in duration of mv icu stay and murray score while the other rct revealed no difference in these clinical outcomes 6364 however neither of the ards studies proved significant 28-day mortality benefit further well-designed rct with larger sample size is warranted to conclude on xbj in ards in a multicenter rct on critically-ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia cap xbj significantly improved pneumonia severity index 28-day mortality duration of mv and icu

covid-19 patients presenting with cytokine release syndrome andor multi-organ failure table 2 19 umifenovir is a synthetic antiviral drug marketed in russia and china for treating seasonal influenza it has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other viruses including sars-cov 66 it is generally well tolerated umifenovir is used alone or in combination with other antiviral treatment in a few covid-19 clinical studies in one trial a total of 81 covid-19 non-icu patients were assigned to either umifenovir group or control group the median times from onset of symptoms to sars-cov-2 rt-pcr negative were similar no clinical differences were reported and the umifenovir group had slightly longer hospital stay 13d vs 11d 67 in a covid-19 case series study the combination of umifenovir lopinavirritonavir and traditional chinese medicine alleviated pneumonia symptoms in all four patients and decreased viral load to undetectable in two 68 a retrospective cohort study on non-ventilated covid-19 patients n33 compared lpvr plus umifenovir and lpvr monotherapy over treatment of 521 days 69 the lpvr plus umifenovir combination group had a higher negative viral detection rate on day 7 and day 14 with significantly improved chest ct scans on day 7 however inflammation markers were not compared at baseline the lpvr monotherapy group had significantly higher corticosteroids usage which could delay viral clearance all available clinical studies on umifenovir are with significant limitations in study designs and sample sizes it appears that umifenovir monotherapy is ineffective the combination of umifenovir with other antivirals might benefit viral clearance and chest ct improvement whether the positive outcome is achieved by using antiviral combination strategy or by adding umifenovir remains to be studied all these studies should be treated as hypothesis generating and should be interpreted with great caution umifenovir is a newly added antiviral option in chinas nhc guide on covid-19 table 2 19 chloroquine cq is a classic antimalarial drug its well-known effect of neutralizing acidic endosomal ph supports broad-spectrum antiviral usage by blocking endosome-mediated viral entry 70 it also exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory benefits in viral infections hcq is a less toxic metabolite of cq both could be toxic and even fatal if overdosed 7172 the adverse effects include retinopathy liver enzyme elevation blood counts change and mood change it is important to monitor drug interactions with other qtc-prolonging agents 7172 since the covid-19 outbreak cq showed antiviral effect on sars-cov-2 in vitro with the 90 effective concentration ec90 of 690 m which is clinically achievable 9 hcq is even more potent in vitro ec50072 m against sars-cov-2 and a pharmacokinetic model found that a regimen of 400 mg twice a day orally followed by 200 mg twice a day orally for four days would achieve therapeutic level 73 an open-label non-randomized clinical trial in france studied hcq regimen of 200 mg three times a day orally with and without azithromycin the study reported 100 viral clearance on day 6 in hcq plus azithromycin group vs 571 in hcq monotherapy group vs 125 in control group 74 however the small-size trial n42 was not randomized the hcq group had higher viral load at baseline the control group had younger patients six patients were excluded in results reporting clinical outcomes were not studied the first published rct assessing hcq in covid-19 was conducted in china n150 75 the primary end point of negative covid-19 test by day 28 shows hcq plus standard of care soc as non-superior to soc alone hcq 854 vs 813 95 ci -103 to 185 however only two patients were severely sick the endpoint by day 28 may not be clinically relevant in mild to moderate illness as viral clearance is expected to happen much sooner it is worth noting that the soc arm is not a placebo more than 50 patients in both arms received other antivirals this introduces a great confounder especially when there are no conclusions on the effect of antivirals in covid-19 yet another small-size hcq trial in shanghai with similar outcomes had the same issue 76 the rct also reports higher adverse effect in hcq plus soc group 30 vs 9 this could be due to the high-dose regimen of hcq 800-1200 mg daily in june a retrospective multicenter study n807 in american veterans with covid-19 showed hcq as ineffective and potentially harmful 77 hcq with or without azm did not decrease mortality mv rate or length of hospitalization the hcq group but not hcq  azm group even had higher risk of death however the study subjects were not randomized naturally patients with severe disease were more likely to start hcq treatment in fact both hcq and hcq  azm groups had more patients with elevated liver enzymes and inflammation markers which are confounders that could affect study outcomes 77 a new york hospital reported qtc prolongation associated with hcq  azm n84 78 qtc increased from a baseline of 435  24 ms to a maximal value of 463  32 ms p  0001 on day 36  16 of therapy no torsades de pointes events were observed so far researches present conflicting outcomes from cq and hcq more rcts with improved study designs are needed to examine the efficacy and whether the clinical benefits of cqhcq are greater than the risks chinas nhc suggests low-dose cq 500mg twice a day for 7 days with some exceptions table 2 19 currently the nih recommends against cq hcq and hcq  azm as treatment for covid-19 except in clinical trials the organization recommends against high-dose cq 600 mg twice daily for 10 days in all settings due to potential toxicity 21 tocilizumab actemra known as a humanized interleukin-6 il-6 receptor antagonist is currently approved for rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine release syndrome crs due to chimeric antigen receptor t cell cart therapy 79 the common side effects of tocilizumab include hypersensitivity reaction and infection 79 in covid-19 patients with crs patients were found to have elevated levels of cytokines such as il-2 receptor il-2r il-6 8 10 and tnf that indicate inflammation and immunological diseases in addition crs was revealed to be associated with the severity of covid-19 80 81 these data suggest that the il-6 pathway may play an important role in the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of covid-19 patients therefore it could be a potential target for immunotherapy of covid-19 a recent one single-group multicenter study showed that within a few days of administration of tocilizumab fever was reduced to normal temperatures and oxygen intake was lowered in 75 of patients with severe or critical covid-19 they also observed a significant improvement in ct imaging abnormally elevated crp and lymphopenia no obvious adverse reactions were identified in this study 82 it suggests that tocilizumab may be a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of severe or critical covid-19 patients however further data from large rcts are required to justify the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab sarilumab kevzara is another fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the il-6 pathway by binding and blocking the il-6 receptor it has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 83 the common toxicities include neutropenia thrombocytopenia infusion reaction and infection 83 the global clinical trials of sarilumab in covid-19 treatment have been initiated to evaluate the clinical outcomes such as fever the need for supplemental oxygen mortality mv icu stay and hospitalization 84 siltuximab sylvant approved in the us to treat patients with multicentric castleman disease is the third potential il-6 targeted therapy for covid-19 trials 83 similar to other il-6 antagonists the common adverse effects of siltuximab are cytopenia infection and hypersensitivity reaction 85 recently an italian clinical team reported that among 21 covid-19 patients with ards who received siltuximab 700 to 1200 mg median 900 mg serum crp level was reduced in 16 patients thirty three percentage of patients were observed to have clinical improvement 43 patients remained stable and 24 patients deteriorated thirty day mortality is not mature to be reported yet 86 efficacy and safety of siltuximab in treatment of covid-19 patients need to be addressed in large sample-size rcts more robust clinical evidence is required to determine whether the il-6 antagonists can provide clinical benefit in covid-19 patients the 7th edition of chinas nhc guideline on covid-19 has included tocilizumab as one of treatment options for patients with severe lung damage and elevated level of il-6 table 2 19 the nih recommends either for or against the use of il-6 inhibitors in covid-19 21 currently the guidance from who focuses on supportive care and the management of complications per general guidelines 20 remdesivir is moderately recommended by the nih for hospitalized severe cases 21 the covid-19 diagnosis and treatment guideline issued by chinas nhc provides several medication therapy recommendations table 2 19 all these therapeutics are discussed in this review this review does not include darunavircobicistat nitazoxanide angiotensin ii receptor blockers and other medications that have been suggested for sars-cov-2 awaiting evidence this review does not discuss any oral-route traditional chinese medications the prescribing of which follows dialectics-based medicine in conclusion supportive care remains the cornerstone of covid-19 management complications should be managed according to general guidelines when safety is ensured remdesivir might be considered early in the course of illness promptly prior to disease progression for potential clinical recovery for the other medication agents discussed in the review outcomes from case reports and case series cannot be generalized for a larger population more well-designed rcts in covid-19 therapies are warranted before final conclusions on efficacy can be made

 none  computational screening of antagonist against the sars-cov-2 covid-19 coronavirus by molecular docking ran yu liang chen rong lan rong shen peng li   recently the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 1 emerged in hubei province pr china 23 the whole-genome sequence of 2019-ncov was first released on january 10 2020 4 2019-ncov has a wide range of infection to mammals including humans this characteristic of transmission leads to the possibility of transmission from animals to people the 2019-ncov known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is highly transmittable and could lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections 5 the spread of 2019-ncov has drawn great attentions and concerns worldwide since 2003 humans have faced two coronavirus-related crises 6 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov broke out in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in the arabian peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 35 7 coronaviruses covs encode replicase complex orf1ab express in the form of polyproteins pp which synthesis the non-structural proteins nsp and four structural proteins namely spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins 8 during proteolytic processing 9 the main protease 3cl protease is a key enzyme in the processing of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab orf1a and orf1ab are cleaved by papain-like protease plpro nsp3 and 3c-like protease 3clpro nsp5 to produce the nsp 10 due to the important function of sars-cov 3cl protease it is considered as an active target for the antiviral drug many 3cl protease inhibitors have been reported over the past decade 11 and a variety of inhibitors were found through screening and structure-based design 12 plpro is an indispensable enzyme in the virus replication and infection of the host and also has been an important target for coronavirus inhibitors a recent study showed that 2019-ncov also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as entry receptor to go into the host cells 13 the spike plays a crucial role during the virus entry to the host cells 14 s protein a type i glycoprotein on the surface of the virus can assist virus to bind to host acceptor which has attracted great attention because of its function in receptor binding the receptor binding domain rbd of spike protein is in charge of the binding to host 72 of the amino acid sequences in the rbds from sara-cov and 2019 ncov are identical however as to 2019-ncov the rigid prolyl residues is replaced with a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues 15 a unique phenylalanine f486 in the loop can penetrate into a the hydrophobic pocket of ace2 16 may play the key role in acceptor recognition nsp12 is a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity four functional proteins in 2019-ncov main protease 3clpro rdrp plpro and spike were all studied as the targets of potential drugs up to now there is no approved special antiviral drug available to be used against covid-19 the fastest way to find drugs anti-2019-ncov is to screen drugs which were commonly used in clinic during the treatment of patients infected by sars-cov-2 17 chloroquine draw great attention which was made by bayer in germany in 1934 as the replacement of natural antimalarial drugs chloroquine was found to be efficient on sars-cov-2 1819 the mechanism of chloroquine is inhibiting quinone reductase 2 a structural similarity of udp-n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids the possible interference of chloroquine with sialic acid biosynthesis could account for the broad antiviral spectrum 19 chloroquine can also impair early stage of virus replication by interfering with the ph-dependent endosome-mediated viral entry of enveloped viruses as well as the post-translational modification of viral proteins but the mechanism of action of chloroquine in anti-2019-ncov is not clear ribavirin is a traditional antiviral drug widely used in clinic for treating a variety of viral infections but for sars ribavirin showed no significant effect 20 the new antiviral drug remdesivir were found to be effective in preventing replication of this virus 21 remdesivir 22 is now as a possible therapeutic option for the covid-19 23 lianhuaqingwen lh as traditional chinese medicine tcm compound preparation has been used to treat influenza and exerted broad-spectrum antiviral effects on a series of influenza viruses lh showed anti-2019ncov activity in the treatment 24 honeysuckle and forsythia are commonly used as antiviral ingredients in tcm which were also included in lh the kinds and quantity of active components in tcm formula is vital for the function of the preparation forsythia has long been used as an antipyretic anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious agent in east asia 25 the compounds in forsythia showed anti-viral activity against h1n1virus and respiratory syncytial virus rsv 26 27 28 29 honeysuckle are traditional medicine used in china 30 the major ingredients in honeysuckle exhibit antibacterial and antiviral 3132 activities luteolin is the main flavonoid in honeysuckle 33 at this situation tcm can contribute as an alternative treatment in 2003 tcm was widely used to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the high similarity between 2019 ncov and sars in genomic and structural characterization suggesting that tcm may have potential use in the current outbreak 34 in this study the binding of chloroquine remdesivir ribavirin and luteolin with main proteins of 2019-ncov 3cl protease plpro rdrp and spike protein were carried out by computational methods the newly-emerged sars-cov-2 nucleotide gene nc0455122 was retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi nucleotide database the important anti-virus drug target protein like 3clpro plpro and rdrp are highly conserved between sars-cov and 2019-ncov especially in functional sites the model of covid-19 main protease was downloaded from protein data bank wwwrcsborg the crystal structure of covid-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor n3 pdb id 6lu7 chain a 35 was chosen as the model of 3cl protease and the inhibitor n3 was removed the ligand n3 n-5-methylisoxazol-3ylcarbonylalanyl-l-valyl-n1-1r2z-4-benzyloxy-4-oxo-1-3r-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-ylmethylbut-2-enyl-l-leucinamide was used as a contrast recent studies highlighted that sars-cov-2 genes share 80 nucleotide identity and 8910 nucleotide similarity with sars-cov genes 3637 the x-ray structure of plpro of human coronavirus papain-like proteases was used as the model of 2019-ncov plpro pdb id 4ovz chain a 38 the ligand p85 n-4-fluorophenylmethyl-1-1r-1-naphthalen-1-ylethylpiperidine-4-carboxamide was used as a contrast the sars hcov solved structure pdb id 6nus chain a was used for binding since it was the most sequelogous solved structure 9708 sequence identity to sars-cov-2 rdrp 6nus is a sars hcov non-structural protein 12 nsp12 solved structure cryo-electron microscopy with 35  resolution which was deposited in the protein data bank in 2019 39 remdesivir was a antagonist of 2019-ncov of rdrp was chosen as a contrast the model of 2019-ncov spike glycoprotein pdb id 6vsb chains a b c 40 was used as the model for molecular docking 6vsb was spike protein prefusion with a single receptor-binding domain solved structure cryo-electron microscopy with 346  resolution the ligand nag n-acetyl-d-glucosamine of 6vsb was used as a contrast autodock vina software was utilized in all the docking experiments with the optimized model as the docking target the screening method is restricted to molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation has not been carried out yet remdesivir and ribavirin are all rdrp antagonists remdesivir could effectively fight against the new coronavirus however ribavirin is invalid molecular docking was used to study the binding difference between the two molecules chloroquine was proved to be clinically effective and its molecular target should be further studied at the same time according to the role of traditional chinese medicine in the treatment of new coronavirus luteolin the main flavonoid of honeysuckle the main antiviral component in lh was selected for molecular docking study to further study the drug prior to testing the ligands against sars-cov-2 target proteins the structures of the small molecules were optimized by the using the classical mm2 force field the active site aspartates of targets were treated as rigid the potential antiviral drugs were found by the effective relationship between molecules and receptor targets grid box 60     60     60  centered at -28059 9486 61528  for the 3cl grid box 60     60     60  centered at -13953 51391 -31750  for the plpro grid box 126     126     126  centered

molecule is the ligand molecule isolated from the crystal structure of 3cl protease which was used as the binding site control according to the analysis of docking results fig 1
 the interactions between luteolin and binding sites are highly consistent with that of n3 luteolin forms five hydrogen bonds with gln-189 leu-4 asn-142 and thr-26 respectively met-49 and val-3 formed hydrophobic interaction with luteolin respectively as to n3 3-h bonds were formed with cys-145 and gln189 n3 formed -cation with his-41 hydrophobic reactions with thr-25 leu-27 leu-4 val-3 and asn-142 there is a hydrogen bond interaction between chloroquine and gln-110 at the binding site hydrophobic reactions with ile 249 ile-200 a -cation contact with gln-107 remdesivir formed 3-h bonds with glu-240 his-246 and pro-108 hydrophobic reactions with pro-132 and ile-200 -cation reaction with gln-107 the ligand p85 of plpro was used as control fig 2
shows p85 formed hydrogen bonds with tyr-269 luteolin formed hydrogen bonds with asn-180 arg-105 and phe-185 in the sites the interactions between ribavirin and asp-38 were hydrogen bonds the binding sites of luteolin and ribavirin are inconsistent with the control molecule 
fig 3
shows remdesivir formed 2-h bonds with trp-509 and his-381 a -cation contacts with phe-504 hydrophobic reactions with lys-508 leu-401 asn-386 and ser-384 ribavirin formed 5-h bonds with leu-271 leu-270 asp-269 and trp-268 luteolin formed 3-h bonds with tyr-273 leu-270 and val-330 two -cation reaction with ser-325 and phe-275 two hydrophobic reactions with leu-329 and pro-328 the binding sites of luteolin and ribavirin are inconsistent with remdesivir however the binding sites of ribavirin and luteolin are close suggesting another active site 
fig 4
shows the formed interactions between the ligands nag luteolin and remdesivir against spike protein of 2019-ncov after docking nag was found to form 3h-bonds with residues val-1122 and ser-1123 additionally nag built -cation contacts with phe-1121 in luteolin 4h-bonds were formed with the residues gln-965 ser-968 and asn-969 -cation interaction was formed between luteolin and phe-970 remdesivir formed 2-h bonds with ala-1070 and gln-1071 hydrophobic interaction with glu-1072 as seen in fig 4 the binding site of remdesivir is close to that of the control molecular nag 
fig 5
 the binding energy of luteolin to the main protease was -537 kcalmol and that of n3 was -363 kcalmol the binding energy of luteolin to the active site is even smaller than that of the control molecule indicating that luteolin has a higher binding activity as to rdrp and spike luteolin also has a smaller binding energy from the point of view of binding energy luteolin shows strong interactions with the targets of new coronavirus lh was effective to fight against the new coronavirus honeysuckle and forsythia are the main antiviral drugs in the formula and luteolin was the main ingredient in honeysuckle luteolin can tightly bind to the newly-emerged coronavirus main protease luteolin binds to the active sites of main protease of 2019-ncov with a lower binding energy than the ligand of the crystal structure which implies a possible strong antiviral activity this study will conduce to the treatment of tcm against new coronavirus chloroquine was an effective treatment to the new coronavirus the binding with the main protease may be a supplement to its mechanisms of action luteolin can be used as a selection for new compounds specific against sars-cov-2 main protease sites  molecular targets for covid-19 drug development enlightening nigerians about the pandemic and future treatment yusuf mummed   there is little or no research initiated to enlighten nigerians about the pathogenesis and targets for drug development for the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection as a way forward to achieve long-lasting future treatment of the disease also many citizens of the country are not aware on the deadliness of the disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a kind of viral infection causing pneumonia-like symptoms was first reported in wuhan china in december 2019 and the disease is caused by sars-cov-2 12 the outbreak was declared a pandemic by who on 30th of january 2020 and it is regarded as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic virus into the human population the severity at which the virus causes infection to the human population is age and immune status dependent it is shorter among patients greater than 70-years old compared with those under the age of 70 with early symptoms which include fever cough and fatigue other symptoms include sputum production headache haemoptysis dyspnoea and lymphopenia fig 1
 3 clinical features unmask by a chest computer tomography ct scan presented as pneumonia however there are also abnormal features such as rnaaemia acute respiratory distress syndrome acute cardiac injury and incidence of ground-glass opacities that can lead to death 3 unfortunately the use of interferon inhalation for the treatment of some cases did not show clinical progress but worsen the condition and can lead to pulmonary opacities 4 besides patients infected with sars-cov-2 also developed gastrointestinal associated symptoms like diarrhea 35 to minimize the transmission of the sars-cov-2 through health care workers and patients it is important to develop methods for the identification of various modes of viral transmission such as through fecal and urine samples 3 genome sequencing of the virus of five patients with pneumonia hospitalized from december 18 to december 29 2019 showed the presence of a previously unknown  coronavirus -cov strain in all of them 6 upon isolation and sequencing of the -cov it shows 88 identity to the sequence of two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes sars-like coronaviruses batsl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 and about 50 identity to the sequence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 7 there are similarities in the genome sequences of sars-cov-2 with a minimum number of ten open reading frames orfs with the genome sequences of other covs such as mers-cov and sars-cov the first orf making up two-third of the sars-cov-2 rna undergoes translation to two polyproteins in comparison to mers-cov and sars-cov in which their two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are then further processed by a post-translational modification to 16 non-structural proteins nsps which are nsp1 to nsp16 8 those nsps are then translocated from the rough endoplasmic reticulum into double-membrane vesicles where the replication and transcription of the virus occurred 910 while the remaining orfs of the sars-cov-2 that are localized on the one-third of the remaining genome are responsible for encoding non-replicating participating accessory proteins with unknown functions and structural proteins such as membrane m nucleocapsid n envelope e and spike proteins s an investigation by scientists in china revealed that the sars-cov requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor for their binding and invasion of the host also the binding is significant in the determination of the pathogenesis of the infection caused by sars-cov 11 nevertheless dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a receptor required by mers-cov for invasion 12 to predict the specificity of zoonotic coronaviruses in the infection of humans and adaptation possibility a better understanding of the proteases action and receptor binding is essential therefore the development of therapeutics for the treatment of sars-cov-2 is highly warranted 3 however this review aims to discuss the molecular pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 its target for drug development to enlighten nigerians on the deadliness of the disease and the way forward to achieve future treatment of the current pandemic the molecular pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 is poorly understood up to date nevertheless mers-cov and sars-cov mechanisms can shed light on the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 the essential protein of sars-cov-2 that mediates binding to a human cell is spike protein a protein involved in the first step of infection the protein is composed of s1 and s2 subunit in which according to cryogenic electron microscopy cryoem studies the receptor-binding domain rbd is a 3d structure with the size of 12 kda which is localized in the s1 subunit the vibrational movement of the rbd has been examined during the characterization of the structure of related mers-cov and sars-cov and was found to have the same mechanism of action with sars-cov-2 interestingly there are similarities in the structure of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike glycoprotein but the only structural difference is in the rbd where the sars-cov-2 rbd is an angle closer to the central cavity of the trimer in the down conformation while sars-cov rbd can packs tightly against the domain of the n-terminal of the neighboring protomer in the down conformation 13 the binding affinity of the two viruses was investigated using surface plasmon resonance which showed that even though sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share the same binding receptor ace-2 the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 is 15 nm which is almost 1015 fold higher than sars-cov binding to ace-2 receptor this is the reason why sars-cov-2 can easily be transmitted from human to human whereas the complex formed by sars-cov-2 s-ectodomain and ace-2 has been studied using high-resolution cryoem which revealed that the complex is similar to the sars-cov complex the spike structural protein mediates entry of sars-cov-2 into human cells it is a trimetric protein of class 1 fusion protein with metastable prefusion conformation it undergoes structural rearrangement before human cell membrane fusion the rearrangement is activated upon binding of rbd of the s1 subunit to the host cell receptor ace2 13 destabilization of the prefusion trimer will then take place upon receptor binding viral membrane with the host cell membrane which will lead to the shedding of the s1 and s2 subunit transition to more stable postfusion conformation the rbd of the s1 will pass through hinge-like movement leading to transient hiding down conformation receptor inaccessible state or exposing up confirmation ie receptor accessible state of the receptor binding determinant therefore this is the mechanism of engaging host cell receptor by sars-cov-2 14 15 16 before entry into human cells mers-cov binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 receptor and sars-cov binds to the ace2 receptor membrane fusion and viral infectivity of coronavirus occurred by proteolytic cleavage of s20 position of s protein this occurred in sars-cov pathogenesis the use of two-step furin activation is essential for the fusion of mers with the host membrane 17 the entry of sars-cov is also mediated by clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis 1819 the sars-cov-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor ace2 which results in its entry into the host the virus releases its rna into the cytoplasm the orf1a and orfab of the rna is translated into polyprotein 1a pp1a and polyprotein ab ppab the orf1a encodes the enzyme protease that cleaves the polyproteins into non-structural proteins nsps which form the rna replicase-transcriptase complex that is needed for structural protein synthesis the replicase complex executes the formation of negative-sense rna upon fragmentation of the negative-sense rna into sub-genomic rna through discontinuous transcription after which fragments that encode spike membrane nucleocapsid and envelope protein are formed the structural proteins are then synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and then they pass through the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic into the golgi apparatus where sortation and assembly take place finally viral protein and genomic rna are then assembled as virion in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi and then released outside the cell as a vesicle 20 21 22 23 after the invasion of cells by sars-cov-2 its antigen will be attached to antigen-presenting cells as the central anti-viral immunity finally major histocompatibility complex mhc or human leukocyte antigen hla in humans present antigenic peptides and then cytotoxic t lymphocytes specific for the sars-cov recognized viral antigen therefore this pathogenesis mechanism fig 2
 of sars-cov will help in the understanding of drug development strategies for sars-cov-2 infection upon presentation of antigen by antigen-presenting cells cellular and humoral immunity of the body is then stimulated by virus-specific b and t cells therefore igm and igg are the common antibody profile of sars-cov and 12 weeks are marked as the time taken for igm against sars-cov to disappear with igg lasting longer 23 more researches on the cellular immunity of coronavirus have been carried out and the most updated report reveals that the number of cd4 and cd8 t cells in the peripheral blood of sars-cov-2 infected patients significantly reduced 24 during the acute phase of sars-cov infection there is a decrease in cd4 and cd8 t cells interestingly sars-cov recovered patients have four years of t cell memory and the t cells can undergo ifn-g production delayed-type hypersensitivity dth response and proliferation even without the antigen 25 also t cell memories against sars-cov persist after six years of infection from recovered patients 26 therefore the understanding of the immunology of sars-cov-2 can help in the development of a vaccine 27 pathological events associated with sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov infection is called acute respiratory distress syndrome ard 24 the mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is that the effector immune cell uncontrollably released deadly systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn-a ifn-g il-1b il6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf-a tgfb etc and also chemokines such as ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 etc 2728 the cytokine and chemokine release by the effector cells will lead to organ failure and death this happened in the severe case of sars-cov-2 infection 24 for better survival of mers cov and sars-cov in the invaded host for example pattern recognition receptor is responsible for recognizing pathogen-associated molecule however the mers and sars viruses will develop a way of producing double-membrane vesicle without pattern recognition receptor this allows the viral genome to replicate without the control of the immune system 29 even though ifn-i ifn-a and ifn-b has a protective effect on sars-cov and mers-cov infection it can be inhibited by mers accessory protein through activation of melanoma differentiated associated protein gene 5 mda5 by interaction with double-stranded directly 30 31 32 to elaborate nuclear transport of ifn regulatory protein and activation of ifn b promoter is blocked by mers-cov orf4a orf4b orf5 and membrane proteins 33 since coronaviruses such mers can destabilize the immune system by altering the antigen presentation cells through the downregulation of gene expression therefore it is important in drug development to develop a strategy of destroying immune evasion by sars-cov-2 4 non-structural proteins nsps are involved in protein synthesis translation rna transcription processing modification virus replication and host infection therefore nsps are considered as a significant functional protein of coronaviruses in which coronavirus main proteinase 3clpro papain-like proteinase plpro rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase are superior molecular targets for small inhibitory molecule drug development as a result of their well-understood enzyme active sites and biological functions for example papain-like proteinase plpro this protein cleaves replicase polyprotein n-terminus leading to the of release nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 which is indispensable for the replication control corrections 7 also plpro can antagonize the immunity of the infected patient 1637 these group of enzymes is necessary for the replication and viral infection and it is the most popular target for coronavirus inhibition it is highly valuable to target the plpro protein of coronavirus to stop the infection of the virus surprisingly there are no fda approved marketed drugs targeting plpro protein interestingly drugs such as thymidine ribavirin chloramphenicol and chlorphenesin carbamate can easily bind to plpro and prevent viral replication 6 intensive research into plpro protein can open a new door of therapeutics development against sars-cov-2 infection then 3c-like main protease 3clpro otherwise called nsp5 this protein is cleaved automatically from polyprotein to form mature enzyme and it is then further cleaved downstream at 11 sites which will then leads to the release of nsp4 to nsp16 interestingly maturation of nsps is directly mediated by 3clpro and the life cycle of the virus depends on the maturation of 3clpro studies into the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3clpro can make it a promising drug development target for covid-19 therefore anti-bacterial drugs such as lymecycline and anti-hypertensive drugs such as nicardipine are all known to block the activity of the 3c-like main protease rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp otherwise known as nsp12 this protein is conserved in coronaviruses it forms the vital enzyme of the viral replication and transcriptional complex rdrp has conserved amino acid of which are serine and 2 aspartic acid therefore nsp12 has been used as an important target for sars and mers drug development even though no specific inhibitor of nsp12-rdrp has been found its targeted inhibition will not result in significant side effects and toxicity of the host cell strengthening research on this target can lead to therapeutic development for sars-cov infection 38 39 40 however natural products that exhibit anti-virus anti-tumor and anti-inflammation effects will exert binding affinity to rdrp molecules such as betulonal from cassine xylocarpa gnidicin and gniditrin from gnidia lamprantha will bind and inhibit the rdrp of coronaviruses helicase nsp13 this is a multifunctional protein with n terminal metal-binding domain and helicase domain the structure of the n terminal contains 26 cysteine residues that make up the zinc and binding domain with c terminus conserved motif helicase is also a necessary component for the replication of coronavirus therefore helicase is identified as a target for antiviral drug discovery but there is less research on helicase inhibitors drugs such as anti-bacterial lymecycline cefsulodine and rolitetracycline anti-fungal such as itraconazole an anti-hiv drug such as saquinavir an anticoagulant drug such as dabigatran and diuretic drug such as canrenoic acid were shown to be potent inhibitors of helicase 4142 also studies have shown that myricetin and scutellarein can potentially inhibit the sars-cov-2 helicase protein in vitro by affecting the atpase activity but not the unwinding activity of nsp13 43 the core structural protein of coronavirus that gathered to form a special corolla like structure on the viral surface like trimer is called spike protein its binds to host cell receptor using its rbd which results to the invasion of the host host cell protease cleaves spike protein into s1 and s2 the s1 binds to surface receptor of the host and s2 mediates virus to cell fusion and cell to cell fusion cleavage activation and structural integrity are crucial in the invasion and virulence activity which is mediated by spike protein 44 strategies to block spike protein as a means of preventing coronavirus from entering the host are regarded as valuable for the development of antiviral drugs 4445 natural flavonoids licoflavonol from glycyrrhiza uralensis therapeutics such as anticoagulant drug dabigatran etexilate anti-fungal drugs posaconazole and itraconazole anti-hypertensive drugs rescinnamine iloprost and prazosin and an anti-bacterial drug sulfasalazine azlocillin penicillin and cefsulodin inhibit coronavirus binding to a receptor in the cell surface of human cell 6 the rdb located in the s1 of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is also a target for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies despite the fact of structural homology of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov by cryoem studies a monoclonal antibody that was originally developed to target sars-cov rbd was tested against sars-cov-2 rbd sd1 fragment but the antibody did not show binding affinity to sars-cov-2 this is to say there are some amino acids involved in the interaction between the rbd of the spike protein and ace2 receptor in sars-cov-2 that are not the same in sars-cov this is further supported by 46 that modeling of sars-cov-2 rdb interaction with ace2 revealed some sequence of amino acids that are important for the interaction between ace2 and rbd of spike glycoprotein but there is less clarity on the actual sequence involved in that interaction therefore there is a need for new monoclonal antibody development for rbd of sars-cov-2 hence the knowledge of spike protein of the sars-cov-2 atomic level using cryoem will enable scientists to carry out protein engineering design and development of more effective inhibitory molecules and monoclonal antibodies 13 virulence factors in coronavirus that interferes with the innate immunity of infected cells are nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a the nsp1 induces degradation of host mrna and interferon type 1 production upon binding to the 40s ribosomal subunit 47 while nsp3c binds with the nucleotide of the host adp-ribose which gives coronavirus the ability to resist innate immunity for instance bone marrow matrix antigen 2 blocks assembled coronavirus in the host cell also sars-cov orf7a interacts with bst 2 and blocks its glycosylation which results in termination of orf7a activity 48 therefore the aforementioned virulence factors are potential drug discovery targets for coronavirus for example anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory natural products can bind and inhibit those virulence factors also drugs such as platycodin d streptomycin tetracycline piperacillin cefpiramide and lymecycline from platycodon grandifloras can potentially inhibit coronavirus virulence factors 4950 the receptor of the spike rna binding domain of sars-cov is the ace2 receptor since sars-cov can interact with the angiotensin receptor blocking the receptor can be a target for therapeutics development for sars-cov-2 infection therefore anti-hypertensive drugs losartan anti-bacterial cefmenoxime hepatoprotective silybin anti-diabetes troglitazone and analgesia ergotamine bind with high affinity to angiotensin 2 receptor 6 rna dependent rna polymerase nsp12 is the most promising molecular target for sars-cov-2 drug development the current state in finding treatment for sars-cov-2 is drug repositioning in which drug targeted for the treatment of the ebola virus called remdesivir which showed efficacy against sars-cov-2 replication therefore the rna dependent rna polymerase inhibitor rdrpscalled remdesivir was developed by gilead science inc to mimic the structure of adenosine and is regarded as nucleotide analog it was developed originally to inhibit ebola virus replication even though the drug did not pass the phase 3 clinical trial on the ebola virus but studies have shown that it is promising for the treatment of covid-19 51 also the drug was reported to be the most promising for sars-cov-2 replication inhibition by who as a result of structural similarities of rdrps of various viruses remdesivir can serve as a broad antiviral drug studies have also shown that the drug is effective against mers-cov interestingly the usa and china commence the phase 3 clinical trial of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 52 even though drugs such as broad-spectrum antibiotics anti-viral drugs and interferons-a nebulization have been used in the reduction of viral load but it is the only remdesivir that has a promising impact on sars-cov-2 the controversy of the efficacy of drugs used in the treatment of sars-cov and mers-cov such as ribavirin corticosteroids lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon is what makes them not to be investigated for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection but the satisfactory result was achieved after the trial of remdesivir in mice model in which after the treatment of the mice a day after infection with coronavirus there is a decrease in the viral load and an improvement in mice pulmonary function however remdesivir administration after the viral load reaches a maximum peak of infection cannot improve the symptoms of the patient but remdesivir can improve patient symptoms before the virus reaches its maximum peak treatment of rhesus monkey with remdesivir 24 h before the infection is promising in the reduction of symptoms associated with mers-cov infection and within 2 h of administration of 10 g of remdesivir in rhesus monkey results to peripheral blood mononuclear blood distribution of the drug followed by drug activation to nucleotide triphosphate 53 according to the new england journal of medicine a patient with recent travel to wuhan china was diagnosed with covid-19 after returning to washington on january 15 2020 even though there is an improvement on the patient symptoms upon remdesivir treatment but the viral load got decreased before the treatment this is to say that the viral infection is self-limiting and his immune system might have started fighting the infection therefore it is not clear whether the improvement in the symptoms of the patient is due to the drug or the patients natural immunity however remdesivir is expected to be a specific drug that targets the rdrp of sars-cov-2 54 the great zealot of chinese to combat the pandemic has initiated research on covid-19 drugs in which remdesivir was approved for clinical trial after passing stringent ethical review and was on 5th february 2020 launched for the trial chinas compassionate use reported that remdesivir will be the immediate drug for the treatment of severe covid-19 if proven to be effective what brought remdesivir to the stage of the clinical trial is safety and good pharmacokinetics 55 remdesivir in vitro inhibition research carried out by wuhan research institute find out that the drug can block the replication of the virus at ec50  077 m cc50  100 m si  12987 very low micromolar concentration of infected-vero e6 cells wang et al 2020 other studies have shown that effective treatment of sars-cov-2 infection can only be achieved by combinational treatment of chloroquine and remdesivir which will result in the blockage of the viral replication and recovery of the patient from the disease 56 chloroquine increases the endosomal ph of a cell as well as affecting glycosylation of cellular receptor these result in blockage of sars-cov-2 infection 5057 the effect of chloroquine on sars-cov-2 was further investigated by 50 and they reported that chloroquine function at entry and post-entry of the virus in addition to its antiviral activity also chloroquine can modulate the immune system which in turn will result in the enhancement of its antiviral activity it can also inhibit the replication of coronavirus in the epithelial cells of lungs through cellular receptor glycosylation interference the authorization to use chloroquinehydroxychloroquine for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection was granted by the fda of the usa hence chloroquine function in the blocking of virus fusion to the cell membrane 5859 widely distribution of chloroquine in blood and lungs upon its administration orally is another interesting future of the use of chloroquine in establishing treatment for sars-cov-2 infection it was recommended that covid-19 patients with mild moderate and severe symptoms should take 500 mg of chloroquine twice in a day this prescription has shown to decrease the length of stay in the hospital with improved symptoms hydroxychloroquine has the same activity as chloroquine because they are having an identical mechanism of action 60 moreover intensive research is needed to unravel the potential of other receptors for drug discovery and development for sars-cov-2 besides 59 reported that synthetic mrna called modernas mrna-1273 can be used as a vaccine for protection against sars-cov-2 infection in which upon its intramuscular administration it can evoke antiviral effect directed to the spike protein this is to say the synthetic mrna encodes pre-fused spike protein of sars-cov-2 the use of mrna to elicit antiviral activity does not need the use of a virus unlike conventional vaccines the clinical trial phase 1 of mrna-1273 is currently taking place and if the vaccine is promising its efficacy will be investigated immediately to sum up rna dependent rna polymerase and spike protein of sars-cov-2 are the most promising targets for sars-cov-2 vaccine and drug development and therapeutics repositioning 61 drug development for viral pathogens is a long-term process however as drug repositioning is taking place for the treatment and reduction of the peak of the covid-19 pandemic it is also imperative to identify some promising targets for drug development to have long-lasting future treatment for the disease also an in-depth understanding of the sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and its atomic studies using cryoem to understand the amino acid involved in the interaction between the rbd of spike protein with ace2 of human cells are essential for effective vaccine and drug development nigerian government should initiate research and clinical trial on antiviral drugs that can inhibit sars-cov-2 infection as the current pandemic is claiming the health and lives of people all over the world it is highly important to initiate and expand researches in the study of pathogenesis and drug targets for sars-cov-2 as this will help in developing treatment and vaccine and also will prepare the world to prepare the future reoccurrence of the disease research should also be initiated on the development of bispecific inhibitors of sars-cov-2 to achieve effective inhibition of the coronavirus activity the author declares that there are no conflicts of interest  binding site analysis of potential protease inhibitors of covid-19 using autodock dipti mothay k ramesh v   coronaviruses members of the family coronaviridae and subfamily coronavirinae are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses which have spikes of glycoproteins projecting from their viral envelopes thus exhibit a corona or halo-like appearance 3 the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia referred to as neo-coronary pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in december 2019 raised global health concerns neo-coronary pneumonia has been officially named by the world health organization as corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 virus has been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus among all known rna viruses coronaviruses have the largest genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length 16 the  306 aa long main protease is a key enzyme for coronavirus replication and is suitable for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors it is responsible for processing the polypeptide into functional proteins 20 the proteases activity is triggered by the binding of molecules to specific points on the protease called active sites however the proteases activity can also be blocked by molecules called inhibitors when an inhibitor attaches to an active site it prevents the binding of substratesinhibiting the action of the protease altogether therefore finding an inhibitor for covid-19s protease may be the first step to beating the epidemic thus the viral protease is a proven drug discovery target in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and an attractive target for the design of anti-corona viral drugs among the potential protease inhibitors the antivirals remdesivir nelfinavir lopinavir and ritonavir along with -ketoamide are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide pro-drug with potent in vitro antiviral activity against a diverse panel of rna viruses such as ebola virus marburg mers-cov sars-cov respiratory syncytial virus nipah virus and hendra virus 18 similarly nelfinavir lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors recommended for the treatment of sars and mers which have similar mechanisms of action as hiv 13 using vero cell lines infected with sars-cov antiviral effects of nelfinavir has been studied 9 25 a separate investigation performed by xu et al 24 indicated that nelfinavir was identified as a potential inhibitor against covid-19 main protease based on binding free energy calculations using molecular mechanics with generalized born and surface area solvation mmgbsa model and solvated interaction energy methods other protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir are currently available in both first and second-line antiretroviral therapy regimens in pediatrics and adult hivaids patients respectively chinas national health commission has recommended using these agents as an adhoc treatment against covid-19 since sars-cov-2 infection is an rna virus similar to hiv lopinavirritonavir is proposed for its management despite the absence of official approval of these drugs for the treatment of covid-19 at present lopinavirritonavir is used for possible treatment of sars-cov-2 infection in countries where the emerging infection prevails 1 due to the absence of crystallographic structure of sars-cov 3c-like protease binding modes of these compounds have been proposed through docking studies 4 14 antiviral like -ketoamides have also been reported in the literature as inhibitors of the coronavirus main protease 11 because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs 26 thus with no proven antiviral agent available current research now suggests that selecting drugs with the appropriate viral restraining mechanisms can yield promising results various clinical trials are being carried out on nucleotide analogue drugs such as remdesivir 17 re-purposing the available protease inhibitor drugs for immediate use in treatment in sars-cov-2 infections could improve the currently available clinical managementthus the twin objective of the current study is 1 to predict the 3d structure of protease of covid-19 and 2 to carry out docking studies with protease inhibitors available in drugbank such as remdesivir nelfinavir lopinavir and ritonavir along with ketoamide this was followed by molecular interaction studies so as to identify any conserved ligand binding sites in the predicted structure 
protease sequence of covid-19 region 1541-1858 was downloaded from genbank database accession no p0c6x71 in fasta format for building the 3d model of protease of covid-19 the target sequence information was submitted to swiss-model server 21 httpswissmodelexpasyorg templates with the highest quality were selected for model building the output of the predicted model generated as pdb file was downloaded for further analysis and visualized using spdbv 410 10 the model was subsequently validated using verify3d 6 prosa 23 and procheck 12 servers the final structure was visualized and analyzed with spdbv program based on literature survey the structural coordinates of 4 potential protease inhibitors namely remdesivir accession no db14761 nelfinavir accession no db00220 lopinavir accession no db01601 and ritonavir accession no db00503 were downloaded from the drugbank database ref for ketoamide the coordinates were separated from the crystal structure of protease of sars coronavirus in complex with -ketoamide pdb id 5n5o available from protein data bank docking studies were attempted to explore the binding mode of the suggested protease inhibitors onto the 3d model of protease of covid-19 using autodock tools 156 7 before docking polar-h atoms were added to the covid-19 model followed by gasteiger charges calculation using autodock tools available from scripps research institute httpwwwscrippsedumbolsondocautodock the macromolecule file was then saved in pdbqt format and ready to be used for docking ligand centered maps were generated by autogrid program with a spacing of 0375  and grid dimensions of 90  90  90 3 gridbox center was set to coordinate  0074 0083 and  0013 in x y and z respectively polar h charges of the gasteiger-type were assigned and non-polar-h atoms were merged with the carbons and internal degrees of freedom and torsions were set default settings were used for all other parameters pymol package 5 was used to visualize the binding interactions between these ligands with 3d model of protease of covid-19 multiple sequence alignment was carried out to identify the conserved regions of protease sequence of covid-19 with orf1ab polyprotein from wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus yp0097243891 and the best pdb template identified by the swiss model server using clustal omega 19 swiss-model server was successful in generating a 3d structure for protease of covid-19 using crystal structure of sars-cov papain-like protease plpro in complex with ubiquitin aldehyde pdb id 4mm3b as the template chimera package was able to superimpose the 3d model of protease of covid-19 onto the crystallographic structure of 4mm3b the root mean square deviation rmsd of c atoms between protease of covid-19 and the pdb template 4mm3b computed was 0065 supp fig 1the quality factor of the residues of protease model of covid-19 when evaluated by verify3d server supp fig 2 showed 9557 of the residues had an averaged 3d-1d score  02 which represents a good score suggesting high compatibility of the atomic model 3d with its amino acid sequence 1dvalidation of model using ramachandran plot available with the procheck server revealed that 867 residues of protease of covid-19 model were in the most favoured regions followed by 126 in additional allowed regions 04 in generously allowed region and 04 in the disallowed regions overall g factor for the predicted structure was  018 supp fig 3 the g-factor provides a measure of the normalcy of stereo-chemical property of a protein model values below  05 shows unusual stereo-chemical property while values below  10 show a highly unusual property since g value obtained for the predicted model in the present study is not less than  05 it is suggestive of satisfactory quality the main chain parameter plot statistics suggested that the overall quality of the predicted model was good prosa energy plot revealed negative energy distribution pattern being scored by the amino acid residues for the predicted structure supp fig 4 the z score calculated by the prosa tool for the model was  755 which is within the range of scores typically found for nmr derived structure for the native protein of similar size since the structure assessment reports were reasonably good for the predicted structure of protease it was not subjected to loop refinement all the 5 potential protease inhibitors viz remdesivir nelfinavir lopinavir ritonavir and ketoamide got docked onto the predicted 3d model of protease of covid-19 with a negative dock energy value as shown in fig 1 the best recorded binding energy value was obtained for nelfinavir  754 kcal mol1 fig 1 further molecular interaction studies showed that protease model of covid-19 had thr75 arg141 gln175and his176 as the potential drug binding sites with more than one drug binding site thr75 and his176 identified with remdesivir fig 1 multiple sequence alignment of protease of covid-19 along with orf1ab polyprotein from wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus yp0097243891 and pdb template 4mm3b revealed bulk of the residues were highly conserved fig 2 including the ligand binding sites thr75 arg141 gln175and his176 of protease of covid-19 the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme which controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 is very similar to that of sars-cov 15 given the fragile health systems new and re-emerging disease outbreaks such as the current covid-19 epidemic can potentially paralyse health systems according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc facilities for undergoing research for covid-19 should strictly implement the appropriate bio-safety practices inside the laboratory due to the extremely high virus transmissibility these factors make it extremely difficult for researchers to work with this virus despite an urgent need to provide a therapy quickly computational studies at the preliminary level can save time and resources the current study thus aims to predict theoretical structure for protease of covid-19 and to explore further whether this homology modelled protein can serve as a target for protease inhibitor drugs such as remdesivir nelfinavir lopinavir ritonavir and ketoamide homology modeling is a useful tool for predicting the 3d structure of proteins quality of the 3d structure of protease of covid-19 generated by swiss-model server using 4mm3b as the template was reasonably good based on the validation reports generated verify3d procheck and prosa servers ramachandran plot analysis suggests the predicted 3d model of protease of covid-19 as a good representation of protein structure with more than 90 of the residues located in the favourable region the z-score calculated by prosa tool for the model was also within the range of scores typically found for nmr derived structure for a native protein of similar size docking results suggests the 5 potential protease inhibitors namely nelfinavir remdesivir lopinavir ritonavir and ketoamide got docked onto the predicted 3d model of protease of covid-19 with a negative dock energy value however the best recorded binding energy value was obtained for nelfinavir based on the lowest dock energy value scored by nelfinavir in relation to remaining ligands this appears to be the drug of choice for treating covid-19 infection since all the ligands have been docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein it will be sensible to give equal importance to all these protease inhibitor ligands the molecular interaction studies also showed that protease model of covid-19 had more than 1 active site residue for remdesivir while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each in a recently reported study by chang et al preprint not peer reviewed remdesivir has been identified to possess docking sites that strongly overlap with the protein pockets and could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent also one in vitro and a clinical study indicate that remdesivir an adenosine analogue that acts as a viral protein inhibitor has improved the condition in one patient  8 22 a combination of the anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir significantly improved the clinical condition of sarscov patients 2 and might be an option in covid19 infections from the output of multiple sequence alignment analysis it is evident that ligand binding sites thr75 arg141 gln175and his176 were conserved across protease sequences of covid-19 wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus and crystal structure of sars-coronovirus considering the global threat posed by covid-19 and with no proven antiviral agent available for immediate relief the current in silico study provide structural insights about the protease of covid-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors  structural basis of the potential binding

sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase leili zhang ruhong zhou   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2a novel coronavirus that has been causing a
once-in-a-century pandemic1 sars-cov-22 belongs to
the family coronaviridae which includes rna viruses such as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov3 which caused a pandemic in
2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-cov4 which has caused a continuing epidemic since 2012 the mortality rate of covid-19 in
the range of 16 is believed to be less deadly than sars
105 or mers 405 however its
reproductive number r0 has been estimated to be
20656 higher than sars and mers covid-19 has been spreading
to all continents with multiple epicenters while certain physical treatment has been shown
to assist patients to fight this disease with their own immune systems7
no proven remedies exist so far causing high mortality rates especially in senior
groups8 this raises high and urgent demand to screen for potential
drugs through either drug-repurposing or novel drug development913 remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue that mimics the structure of adenosine it was
originally developed by gilead sciences inc to treat ebola virus disease14 even though it has not passed the phase 3 clinical trial of ebola treatment
it showed promising improvement over the mortality rate of this deadly disease15 in the case of ebola virus remdesivir was found to act as an rna-dependent
rna polymerase rdrp binding substrate that replaces atp in the polymerization process
before terminating it14 such an agent is also known as a chain
terminator upon entering the body remdesivir is hydrolyzed and phosphorylated
through metabolism using the core of the molecule as a nucleoside gs-44152414 we term the hydrolyzed and phosphorylated remdesivir as
remtp like other nucleotide analogues remdesivir could potentially be
utilized as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug16 due to the structural
similarities of rdrps of various viruses17 for example it was
clinically tested against mers-cov and showed significant efficacy18
currently phase 3 trials of remdesivir against covid-19 are under progress in the
us19 it has been shown that remdesivir shortens the time of recovery
among covid-19 patients19 leading to the recent approval of it for
emergency use authorization eua by food and drug administration fda however the
detailed inhibition mechanism of remdesivir remains unknown therefore we carried out a
physics-based molecular modeling study on the binding mechanism between remdesivir and
sars-cov-2 rdrp note that the rdrp complex of coronaviruses has multiple nonstructural
protein nsp units such as nsp12 nsp8 and nsp7 among which nsp12 possesses some minimal
polymerase activity on its own20 a previous study revealed that
remdesivir mainly substituted atp as substrate to nsp12 of sars-cov rdrp21 the nsp8 and nsp7 cofactors although found to significantly enhance the polymerase
activity of sars-cov rdrp22 are structurally distant from the nucleoside
triphosphate ntp binding site17 to build a minimal model we narrowed
down our search of the remtp binding site to nsp12 of sars-cov-2 rdrp we employed homology
modeling to first construct the tertiary structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12 the initial binding
mode of atp to sars-cov-2 nsp12 was subsequently determined by structural alignment to the
atp bound poliovirus rdrp due to the structural resemblance of viral rdrps however
we must emphasize that our proposed binding structure should be considered as a checkpoint
structure before the rna template is inserted which is therefore considered as a
preinsertion binding mode as was the case for the poliovirus rdrp
structure23 we then performed molecular dynamics md simulations to
validate the identified preinsertion binding mode upon locating the stable binding mode we
further carried out free energy perturbation fep calculations to identify the key residues
in the binding process and estimate the binding affinity of remtp and atp to sars-cov-2
nsp12 the structure of sars-cov nsp12 rdrp was obtained from the protein data bank pdb id
6nur17 the
sequence of sars-cov-2 nsp12 rdrp sars-cov-2 nsp12 was obtained from entry yp0097253071 at
ncbi24 sequence alignment and homology modeling were performed with
modeler 92325 with unresolved structures on the n-terminus and
c-terminus truncated gray residues on figure 1a which should not affect our current binding affinity calculations due to
their structural distances from the binding pocket based on the cocrystal structure of poliovirus rdrp with atp23 pdb
id 2ily we prepared the initial
structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12-atp complex by aligning the fingers domain
of the two proteins based on the alignment of the sequence ie one from poliovirus and
one from covid-19 note that this is the initial structure which will be optimized by md
simulations the complex structure of remtp was then aligned with that of atp for the
corresponding simulations chelating mg2 ions are often needed for these
rdrps which are positioned in our simulations based on previous studies on class
i rna polymerase26 a total of nine different simulations were
performed one for the apo form of sars-cov-2 nsp12 two independent runs for sars-cov-2
nsp12-atp no mg2 two for sars-cov-2 nsp12-atp with mg2 two
for sars-cov-2 nsp12-remtp no mg2 and two for sars-cov-2 nsp12-remtp with
mg2 the parameters of remtp were generated by charmm cgenff27 and listed in table s2 all other parameters were taken from charmm3628 simulations were performed with gromacs 51229 van der waals
interactions were treated with a switching distance of 10  and a smooth cutoff
distance of 12  electrostatic interactions were treated with particle mesh ewald
with a grid size of 1  all simulations lasted about 100 ns before the free energy
perturbation calculations the thermodynamic cycles of our fep calculations were illustrated in figure s1 a softcore potential was applied in fep and more details can be
found in our previous studies30 the  windows were set as 000
000001 00001 0001 001 005 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 095
099 0999 09999 099999 100 to avoid the well-known fep end-point catastrophe
namd 21331 was used to perform the fep calculations the starting fep
complex structures of sars-cov-2 nsp12 binding with ntp atp or remtp were selected using
the clustering algorithm based on the rmsd of ntp while sars-cov-2 nsp12 was aligned the
largest cluster of each simulation was taken to carry out the fep calculations all other
simulation parameters were the same as md simulations each simulation was repeated 10
times with different random seeds to obtain the standard error of the free energy
changes we constructed the homology model of sars-cov-2 nsp12 by first aligning the sequences
between sars-cov-2 nsp12 wu et al24 ncbi yp0097253071 and the
recently resolved sars-cov nsp12 rdrp structure17 pdb id 6nur the sequence identity was 958
with 131 unresolved terminal residues 10 unresolved hinge residues and 24 mutated
residues figure 1a the 3d structure of
sars-cov-2 nsp12 was then created with the modeler package without the 131 unresolved
terminal residues the 10 unresolved hinge residues residues 896905 were
estimated with the default algorithm thus resulting in a random coil configuration
because of the high sequence conservation the backbone rmsd between 6nur nsp12 and sars-cov-2 nsp12 was a mere
025  figure 1b the similarity between
two proteins has been verified by the newly solved cryo-em structure pdb id 6m71 of sars-cov-2 nsp12 the rmsd is 055
 between pdb ids 6nur and
6m7132 the
newly added random coil and 24 mutated residues have been highlighted in figure s2 it was previously discovered that rdrps of various
viruses share the same morphology with common building blocks17 the
fingers domain amino acids 398581 628687 thumb domain amino acids
816919 and palm domain amino acids 582627 688815 figure 1c the grip a hole formed
between these three domains served as the binding site for the rna template and
nucleoside triphosphates ntps additionally the sars-cov nsp12 also featured a unique
n-terminal extension which was mostly conserved in sars-cov-2 nsp12 colored by green in
figure 1c comparing figure
1c and figure s2 we notice that the majority of the mutations occur at the
n-terminal extension and the palm domain meanwhile the fingers domain and the thumb
domain remain highly conserved consequentially the rnantp binding grip is highly
conserved as a simple test on the structural stability we ran a 100 ns simulation on the
apo form of sars-cov-2 nsp12 the rmsd compared to the initial structure figure 1d remains below 3  indicating that
the constructed protein is stable no crystal structures exist yet for the atp-bound sars-cov-2 nsp12 therefore we
referred to another atp-bound rdrp structure from poliovirus pdb id 2ily utilizing the structural conservation
of viral rdrps the binding structure of atp to poliovirus rdrp is shown in figure 2a with residues in close contact with atp
labeled the triphosphate part of atp mostly interacts with positively charged residues
we define residues to interact with the substrate when the closest heavy atom distance is
below 5  same below such as k159 r174 r163 k167 k172 and k359 the
negatively charged residue d323 in the vicinity implies the existence of a chelated ion
mg2 suggested by other studies26 the nucleoside part
of atp adenosine interacts with more diverse residues such as k61 i176 e177 d238
and s288 which are mostly hydrophilic with only one hydrophobic residue to approximate
the binding mode of atp in sars-cov-2 nsp12 we aligned the fingers domain of poliovirus
rdrp with that of sars-cov-2 nsp12 because this was the main constituent of the grip the
aligned sars-cov-2 nsp12 is shown in figure 2b
with both atp and remtp referred to as ntp for either note that the residue numbers are
drastically different because of the size of the protein 932 residues in sars-cov-2 nsp12
versus 461 residues in poliovirus rdrp as expected the alignment ensured that
triphosphates of ntps are in close contact with positively charged residues k545 r551
r553 and r555 nucleosides of ntps are surrounded by residues like t556 v557 a558
c622 d623 and s682 which are still mostly hydrophilic with only some hydrophobic our
alignment of the preinsertion site here indicates once again the conservation of the
binding grip from viral rdrps md simulations were then carried out from the initial binding complex structures prepared
above we ran two sets of simulations for both atp and remtpone set without
mg2 and one set with mg2to examine the structural
influence of mg2 the initial position of mg2 was constructed
based on previous studies on class i rna polymerase of poliovirus26 we
must emphasize that at least two mg2 ions are needed for the catalytic
process in rna replication with one structurally bound to
ntp2633 however
the exact location of the second mg2 remains in debate3335 the inclusion of a second mg2 also tended to destabilize
the ntp binding to hepatitis c virus rdrp33 therefore in our
current work we included at most one mg2 ion more studies are needed in
terms of understanding the functions of mg2 in sars-cov-2 rdrp we performed clustering analysis based on the rmsd of ntps during the simulations with
sars-cov-2 nsp12 aligned we noticed that by adding the mg2 the largest
cluster size was slightly larger than that without mg2 figure s1a vs s1b this indicates that mg2 might have
stabilized the binding between atp and sars-cov-2 nsp12 as a result the determined
bound state defined as the largest binding cluster observed in our
simulations was likely from the first set of simulations of sars-cov-2 nsp12-atp with
mg2 figure s1b upper panel a closer examination figure 4a showed that the bound
state did not deviate much from the initial structure which was aligned to
2ily the triphosphate of atp was
found to interact with s549 k551 r553 r555 from the fingers domain r836 from the
thumb domain and mg2 particularly the first solvation shell of
mg2 consisted of one to two phosphate oxygens and four to five water
oxygens mg2 was situated between the triphosphate group and the palm domain
of nsp12 neutralizing the slightly negatively charged protein surface featuring d618
d761 and e811 the adenosine of atp was found to interact with m542 t556 v557 a558
and s682 from the fingers domain similar to its initial structure this indicates a
remarkable consistency between the preinsertion binding modes of atp to rdrps from
two species poliovirus and sars-cov-2 additionally we plotted the solvent accessible
surface of sars-cov-2 nsp12 upon binding to atp figure 4b atp was found to reside well inside a local pocket within the grip
however the extra space as seen on the right side of the adenosine group
might suggest a possible druggable target to further test this assumption we performed
molecular docking with several adenosineguanosine analogues see more details in the
supporting information interestingly several molecules including remtp
with an enlarged nucleoside occupied the top of the list ordered by docking scores see
table s1 for details likewise we performed the md simulations for the putative binding structures of remtp in
sars-cov-2 nsp12 similar to that of atp the largest cluster size of remtp with
mg2 is significantly larger than that without mg2 figure 3a vs figure 3b the bound state was therefore chosen as the largest cluster
of the first set of simulations with mg2 figure 3b upper panel a closer inspection of this structure showed that
it deviated from the atp binding site somewhat figure 5a while staying as the most stable binding state in our simulations this was
mainly due to the binding of the additional nitrile group cn in remtp to
the shallow pocket formed by k545 y546 and a547 from the fingers domain the
triphosphate part of the molecule mainly interacted with positively charged residues k551
r553 and r555 from the fingers domain k621 and k798 from the palm domain and r836
from the thumb domain along with mg2 and s549 from the fingers domain
similar to the atp binding state mg2 was situated between the triphosphate
group of remtp and the palm domain of nsp12 with a solvating layer of water separating
the mg2 and the slightly negatively charged protein surface the base part of
the remtp mainly interacted with k545 a547 s549 r555 and v557 from the fingers
domain interestingly d618 from the palm domain a previously identified residue that
was crucial for the sars-cov rdrp activity21 was found to be directly
affected by the binding of remtp by remtp forming a hydrogen bond with k798 which could
have originally formed a hydrogen bond with d618 another interesting finding was that
the configuration of remtp in the preinsertion binding state seemed to
block the grip of sars-cov-2 nsp12 where the rna template inserts figure 5b therefore it might potentially slow down
the activity of rdrp on top of its supposed function that remtp could act as a
terminating nucleotide on the rna14 our optimized binding structure
agrees with the remtp binding structure hypothesized by gao et al32
which showed that r555 v557 and d618 were among the key binding residues we followed the thermodynamic cycle illustrated in figure s1c and figure 3c to
calculate the relative binding free energy of atp and remtp with the zero-point energy
reference as the mtp molecule methanol triphosphate the binding free energy of the most
stable binding structures was then calculated and averaged over 10 runs of fep
calculations the relative binding free energy g of atp
was found to be 488  062 kcalmol while that of remtp was 768
 057 kcalmol the difference between the two was 280  085
kcalmol equating to 94 times of the difference in kd
values under 310 k it should be noted that fep can converge slowly particularly on
systems where the environments of the target alchemical modification undergo slow response
fluctuations for this purpose various advanced free energy computing strategies were
developed such as funnel metadynamics36 and orthogonal space random
walk osrw37 in this study we adopted a simple approach following
our previous studies3841 with multiple runs starting from the most probable
binding cluster it would also be desirable in the future to study the ligandrdrp
binding process with more advanced sampling techniques such as replica exchange42 replica exchange with solute tempering43 and
metadynamics44 to help reduce the enormous computational resources
required it takes hours if not days in experiment to measure
kd values typically and better understand the underlying
mechanism of the therapeutic effects of remdesivir nevertheless our calculations strongly suggest that remtp would almost completely
replace the native ligand atp when both presenting at the binding grip of
sars-cov-2 nsp12 this finding supplements the previous study where remtp was found to
bind with the ebola rdrp45 it also suggests that if administrated
correctly and highly metabolized remdesivir might indeed be a promising drug to
significantly lower the reproduction of sars-cov-2 this finding agrees with the study by
yin et al46 where remtp completely blocks the activity of sars-cov-2
rdrp with 110 concentration of atp additionally the backbone rmsd of our modeled rdrp
is only 33  from the solved cryo-em structure with the inserted rna
template46 indicating a good overall agreement with the experimental
structure more importantly a structure overlay of our predicted preinsertion state of
remtp and the postinsertion cryo-em structure figure s3 reveals that remtp is situated perfectly to form hydrogen bonds
with the primer rna ready to be incorporated in the polymerization process in this study we constructed the homology model of sars-cov-2 nsp12 rdrp with high
sequence identity 958 all key residues at the rnantp binding site were conserved
between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 although there has been no cocrystal structure yet for atp
bound with either sars-cov or sars-cov-2 rdrps we successfully constructed a model
for atpremdesivir binding with sars-cov-2 nsp12 based on a previous cocrystal structure of
poliovirus rdrp the relative binding free energy of atp the baseline is mtp same below
was subsequently calculated to be 488  062 kcalmol with the presence of
mg2 the active metabolite of remdesivir remtp was found to have a relative
binding free energy of 768  057 kcalmol which is significantly stronger
than atp the 100-fold difference in the kd value might
decisively block atp out of the preinsertion site when remtp is in the vicinity
subsequently remtp could act as an effective sars-cov-2 rna-chain terminator stopping its
rna replication more studies are still needed to explore the details of this process
especially on how nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors mediate the entry and incorporation of remtp
finally the previously identified crucial residue d618 was affected by the binding of
remtp indicating a possible secondary effect of this drug that would slow down the activity
of rdrp thus also helping cure covid-19  liu shen capsule shows antiviral and anti-inflammatory abilities against novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 via suppression of nf-b signaling pathway qinhai ma weiqi pan runfeng li bin liu chufang li yuqi xie zhoulang wang jin zhao haiming jiang jicheng huang yongxia shi jun dai kui zheng xiaobo li zifeng yang   coronaviruses covs are a group of enveloped viruses named for their coronary appearance with positive single-stranded rna genomes that infect animal hosts 1 many of the coronaviruses were recognized as viruses typically causing pneumonia and colds until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 from zoonotic sources 2 in addition a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in wuhan china in december 2019 34 like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 can also cause severe respiratory illness and even death moreover the populations susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events highlighting the necessity to prepare for the future emerging viruses 5 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 spreads rapidly among humans and likely originates in bats 36 the initial patient cluster with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection was reported as pneumonia with unknown aetiology which bore some resemblance to both sars-cov and mers-cov infections and was associated with icu admission and high mortality moreover patients requiring icu admission had higher concentrations of g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf- than did those not requiring icu admission suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 7 to date the severity of sars-cov-2 has tended to be mild the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases was 43 in a single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients 8 and the infection fatality risk could be below 1 or even below 01 in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections 9 however the basic reproduction number r0 of person-to-person spread was about 26 which meant that the cases of infection would grow at an exponential rate as of 7 february 2020 57620 cases of sars-cov-2 have been reported in china including 26359 suspected cases and a sustained increase is predicted it is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences of the information available to date since no specific antiviral treatment for sars-cov-2 infection is currently available supportive cares including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most important management strategy especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome 410 currently there is no special antiviral treatment or vaccine against the new virus therefore it is of great importance to research and develop effective and safe antiviral drugs it has been reported that many traditional chinese medicine tcm prescriptions could not only inhibit the replication of virus directly but also attenuate excessive pro-inflammatory responses and tissue damage by viruses 11 12 13 therefore it is significantly to study the traditional chinese medicines that have obvious advantages in the treatment of the new virus liu shen capsule ls a traditional chinese medicine has been used to treat influenza tonsillitis pharyngitis and mumps for more than a century 14 it consists of bezoar the gall-stone of bos taurus domesticus gmelin musk the excretion of moschus cinobufagin venom toad the excretion of venenum bufonis pearl the shell of pernulo realgar and borneol in previous studies it was shown that the ls exhibited a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory anticancer antiviral analgesic antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities 1516 in addition ls could inhibit viral propagation and regulate immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with oseltamivir in reducing the course of h1n1 virus infection notably the anti-influenza activity of ls in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines such as ifn- il-1 il-6 and tnf- 17 however there is no exact evidence that ls is effective in the treatment of sars-cov-2 and its mechanisms of action remain obscure therefore to study the antiviral activity of ls on sars-cov-2 and its potential effect in regulating the hosts immune response we evaluated the antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficiency of ls against a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 from guangzhou in vitro in this study a comprehensive evaluation of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of ls was performed in vitro with sars-cov-2 infection it demonstrated that ls inhibited the replication of the virus in a dose-dependent manner and found that ls could reduce the number of viral particles moreover ls could markedly decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in infected human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines huh-7 which may result in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the inhibition of ls against sars-cov-2 infection ls lot sa01004c used in this study was produced and provided

 ls showed unapparent cytotoxicity for the cell lines at concentrations up to 20 gml and remdesivir was chosen as the positive control and showed no cytotoxicity to cell lines at a concentration of 50 m the antiviral activities of ls and remdesivir against sars-cov-2 were evaluated using cytopathic effect cpe inhibition assay fig 1 and plaque reduction assay fig 2
 sars-cov-2 caused a severe cpe in vero e6-infected cells including cell rounding detachment and death a reduction in sars-cov-2-induced cpe after 72 h incubation indicated the antiviral activity of ls and remdesivir it was found that ls 2 gml 1 gml and 05 gml and remdesivir 5 m and 25 m significantly reduced the cpe caused by infection in vero e6 cells and the ic50 values of ls and remdesivir were 06024 gml and 06505 m respectively and the selectivity index si of ls and remdesivir was 818 and 20384 respectively the results showed that ls was able to protect cells from virus-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner the plaque reduction assay was carried out to confirm the efficacy of ls on sars-cov-2 propagation vero e6 cells were infected with sars-cov-2 moi  01 and incubated with overlay medium containing various concentrations of ls after three days the overlays were then removed and stained with 01 crystal violet the plaques were visualized and counted remdesivir was used as a positive control at 5 m the results showed the average size and plaque number in ls-treated cells were markedly reduced in a dose-dependent manner and ls 200 100 050 gml and remdesivir 5 m could significantly inhibit the viral plaque formation p  005 fig 2 the above assays showed that ls might be a potential antiviral drug for sars-cov-2 to verify the antiviral efficacy on sars-cov-2 tem assay was performed in the infected-cells which were treated with ls 200 gml or remdesivir 5 m fig 3
 the results showed that no virus particles were found in the cell control group nc fig 3a and e and many virions were found in the cytoplasm intracellular vesicles and cell membrane and presented typical coronavirus morphology in the virus group under electron microscopy after 48 hrs pi fig 3b and f treatment with ls 200 gml fig 3c and g and remdesivir 5 m fig 3d and h resulted in a reduction of the number of virions and inhibited the entrance into the intracellular vesicles of the virus compared with the virus group sars-cov-2 infection is known to be able to induce a strong inflammatory reaction hallmarked by the production of cytokines and chemokines therefore the expression of cytokines on the infected cells was measured to determine the influence of ls or remdesivir 5 m on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by sars-cov-2 the mrna and protein expression of il-6 tnf- il-1 cxcl10ip-10 ccl2mcp-1 and il-8 in huh-7 cells were detected by rt-qpcr and elisa as shown in fig 4 fig 5
 the mrna and protein expression of il-6 tnf- il-1 cxcl10ip-10 ccl2mcp-1 and il-8 in the virus group were significantly up-regulated 48 h after infection in the huh-7 cells infected by sars-cov-2 p  001 compared with that in the nc group compared with the virus group ls and remdesivir significantly reduced the mrna and protein expression of il-6 tnf- il-1 cxcl10ip-10 ccl2mcp-1 and il-8 in a dose-dependent manner in huh-7 cells 48 h after infection p  001 or p  005 respectively this indicated that ls might be an effective anti-inflammatory agent to further study whether the antiviral and anti-inflammation mechanisms induced by virus of ls was related to the inhibitory of nf-bmapk signaling pathway activation the expression of the key proteins related to the nf-bmapk signaling pathway was examined as shown in fig 5 the protein expressions of p-nf-b p65 p-ib and p-p38 mapk of the virus group were significantly increased compared with the nc group p  005 and the expression of ib of the virus group were significantly decreased compared with the nc group p  005 compared with the virus group the protein expression of the p-nf-b p65 p-p38 mapk and p-ib were significantly reduced in huh-7 cells with ls 20 10 and 05 gml and remdesivir and ib was significantly upregulated while the expression of nf-b p65 and p38 mapk was no significant difference the number of infections caused by sars-cov-2 continues to rise sharply in the world 2425 the viral infection has widely and rapidly spread worldwide 26 it is a major coronavirus infection which threatens human life after sars and mers 27 for this sudden and lethal disease no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines have been developed and supportive care and non-specific treatment of patients are currently the only options to ameliorate the symptoms 28 29 30 therefore effective and safe antiviral agents are urgently needed currently the use of tcm is a popular and acceptable therapy and many tcm prescriptions have been proven to have obvious therapeutic effect on the virus by inhibiting the replication of the virus directly and improving the immune functions of the host organism it may be a potential effective drug source for new drug discovery ls is a tcm used to treat tonsillitis influenza pharyngitis and mumps however the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects induced by sars-cov-2 and the potential mechanisms of ls in treating viral pneumonia are less understood therefore the potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of ls induced by sars-cov-2 were investigated in the present study it was the first time to clarify that ls could not only inhibit sars-cov-2 infection but also significantly suppress the inflammation caused by sars-cov-2 through a mechanism that involved the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines first the effects of ls against sars-cov-2 in vitro by cpe assay and plaque reduction assay fig 1 fig 2 were measured the results showed that ls was able to protect cells from virus-induced cell death and inhibit the average size and plaque number in ls-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner the si index of ls reached 818 table 1 all these results confirmed that ls might be a potential antiviral drug for sars-cov-2 tem has been a potent tool to observe virus entry virus particle assembly viral ultrastructure and budding from the plasma membrane 31 to understand the antiviral details of ls tem images were taken from each group fig 3 abundant virus particles assembled at the surface of the membrane cytoplasm and plasma vesicles in cells infected with sars-cov-2 decreased with the treatment of ls at 200 gml it is reported that highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov cause fatal pneumonia which is mainly associated with rapid virus replication massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokinechemokine responses although the pathophysiology of fatal pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses has not been completely understood recent studies suggest a crucial role of cytokine storm in causing fatal pneumonia 32 early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines eg il-1 il-6 cxcl-10ip-10 and ccl-2mcp-1 in the serum of sars patients 33 which was similar to the serum patients with mers with increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines ie ifn- tnf- il-15 and il-17 34 it also reported that the expression of the cytokine storm in the ncip patients in icu than those in non-icu patients 7 therefore the mrna and protein production of il-1 tnf- ccl-2mcp-1 cxcl-10ip-10 il-6 and il-8 induced by sars-cov-2 was detected the results showed that ls inhibited the release of il-1 tnf- ccl-2mcp-1 cxcl-10ip-10 il-6 and il-8 induced by sars-cov-2 in huh-7 cells fig 4 fig 5 in a dose-dependent manner the change of cytokine profiles suggested that ls might have a potential effect on the inhibition of the cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 since the sars syndrome is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response and nf-b is the major transcription factor activated in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 35 similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 can also cause severe respiratory illness and even death nf-b plays an important role in mediating inflammation immune responses and other cellular activities 36 activation of nf-b can induce cytokines production and these cytokines can react upon in turn and they produce a positive autoregulatory loop and exacerbate the inflammatory response 37 therefore to understand the molecular mechanism of ls against virus infection the regulation of the nf-bmapk signaling pathway contributes to the alleviation of inflammation the results showed that sars-cov-2 activated the nf-b mapk signaling pathway and ls could significantly decrease sars-cov-2-induced activation of p-nf-b p65 p-ib and p-p38 mapk and increase the expression of the ib fig 5 we inferred that the underlying mechanism of ls is to impair the upregulated proinflammatory cytokines induced by sars-cov-2 via inhibiting the activity of nf-bmapk signaling pathway the change of cytokine profiles suggested that ls might have a potential effect on the inhibition of cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 in conclusion our results revealed that ls could significantly protect cells from virus-induced cell death and inhibit the average size and plaque number in vitro the anti-sars-cov-2 effect was attributed to the blocking of the proliferation of virus inhibiting the formation of virus particles and inhibiting the upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by sars-cov-2 via regulating the activity of nf-bmapk signaling pathway these findings warrant further evaluation of ls as a potential agent for sars-cov-2 treatment and provide information to further reveal the mechanisms ls may be an effective anti-inflammatory agent and can be used to treat the inflammation induced by sars-cov-2 the authors declare no conflict of interest  an overview of the safety clinical application and antiviral research of the covid-19 therapeutics wang dongyuan li zigang liu yihui   emerged in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused an international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and spread rapidly to over 100 countries in the world on january 21 2020 the chinese government regarded covid-19 as the class b infectious diseases and took prevention and control measures as class a infectious diseases on february 11 2020 the novel coronavirus pneumonia was named covid-19 by whoworld health organization in late may 2020 the number of covid-19 confirmed cases was over 5000000 worldwide and the number of death was over 3000001 in fact this is not the first time of a serious infectious disease caused by coronavirus both the sars-cov in 2003 and the mers-cov in 2012 belong to the coronaviridae family 2 due to the strong infectivity high fatality rate and the absence of specific medicine for sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 each outbreak of the coronavirus has brought heavy burden to the society coronavirus is a positive strand rna virus with enveloped structure which have the corona like protuberances on its envelope and look like a crown 3 this kind of virus can be traced back to 80 years ago and isolated from chicken embryos 4 up to now approximately 15 different coronavirus strains have been discovered and can infect a variety of mammals and birds 5 among these coronavirus strains only sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 can infect human and cause fatal pneumonia 5 the clinical features of these three coronaviruses are similar and can range from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure 5 coronavirus mainly relies on its envelope structure to invade host cells there are three kinds of proteins on its envelope including spike proteins protein envelope protein and membrane protein 6 s protein plays a key role in recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors and mediating the fusion of virus envelope with cell membrane 7 the cleavage and activation of s protein of sars-cov-2 is mediated by transmembrane protease serine subfamily member 2 tmprss2 8 the s protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 recognizes the same host receptor namely ace2angiotensin-converting enzyme 28 9 10 thus inhibitors of tmprss2 or ace2 could have the potential for the treatment of sars-cov-2 the virus enters the host cell via endocytosis forms lysosomes and then releases virus rna regulated by related protease and ph 11 the endosomal acidification inhibitors such as chloroquine and membrane fusion inhibitors such as arbidol can also be used for the clinical study of covid-19 therapy afterwards the rna completes the transcription and translation of virus proteins and rna replication occurs in the cytoplasm these processes can be blocked by the nucleoside analogues such as remdesivir protease inhibitors such lopinavirritonavir sars-cov-2 3clpro proteasefor processing of polyproteins translated from the viral rna inhibitors such as pyridine-containing -ketoamides12 13 14 finally the protein shells combine with rna to generate new coronavirus particles which are secreted to extracellular environment through golgi apparatus and infect new cells 7 with a better understanding of the structure the infection mechanisms of sars-cov-2 and the clinical symptoms of covid-19 patients many drugs had been used for the clinical practice of covid-19 up to now the therapeutic options for covid-19 can be classified into small molecules peptide inhibitors traditional chinese medicines and biologics

 in late may 2020 over 1600 clinical trials have been registered to find the effective treatments for covid-19 from clinical trial registry platforms httpclinicaltrialsgov and httpwwwchictrorgcn the most widely used therapeutic drugs include abidol ribavirin favipiravir interferon- chloroquinehydroxychloroquine kaletralopinavirritonavir remdesivir gs-5734 sars-cov-2-specific neutralizing antibodies and so on besides the newly discovered small drugs peptides and vaccine are also under pre-clinical or clinical researches in this paper we systematically introduced the safety clinical efficacy and the progress of antiviral researches of these drugs hoping to provide some ideas for the therapeutic options of covid-19 worldwide and better understand the antiviral strategies prepared for the life-threaten virus diseases in the future this review was conducted according to the studies which were randomized controlled trials rcts prospective cohort retrospective cohort studies and so on performed among adult patients with covid-19 and evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-coronavirus agents the studies were excluded if they lacked a control group or target quantitative outcomes the primary outcomes included mortality virological eradication and clinical improvement the secondary outcomes included improvement of symptoms time to become afebrile improvement of chest radiography results utilization of mechanical ventilation intensive care unit admission and adverse events all the date was searched from pubmed embase china national knowledge infrastructure cnki and wanfang data was performed without language restriction unpublished trials were also identified from clinical trial registry platforms httpclinicaltrialsgov and httpwwwchictrorgcn preprint articles were retrieved from the websites medrxiv httpswwwmedrxivorg and biorxiv httpswwwbiorxivorg in the phase i clinical trial of remdesivir 3-225 mg intravenous injection of single dose hill climb test was conducted the subjects showed good tolerance and all the adverse reactions were grade 1 or grade 2 with aspartic transaminase ast or alamine aminotransferase alt increasing but no abnormality in total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase alp or albumin and no effect on renal function 16 according to a recently randomised clinical trial rct of covid-19 66 102155adverse events of remdesivir treatment were observed compared to the 645078 in placebo treatment 17 remdesivir has not yet been approved for antiviral therapy and is currently used for the phase iii clinical trial of covid-19 in china the dosage form of remdesivir used in clinical trials is freeze-dried powder injection and the designed administration mode is as follows on the 1 st day 200 mg loading dose of remdesivir was provided by intravenous dripping and then 100 mg maintenance dose of the drug was provided by intravenous dripping every day for 9 days from international clinical trials registry platformwho ictrp remdesivir had previously shown inhibitory effect on coronaviruses such as sars-cov mers-cov and covid-19 in vitro or in vivo 18 19 20 the cell-based experiments showed that remdesivir can inhibit intracellular replication of covid-19 with ec50 of 077 m 20 indicating that remdesivir may be a promising candidate for the treatment of covid-19 since the first american covid-19 patient treated with remdesivir got obvious clinical benefits numbers of clinical trials of remdesivir were preformed to investigate the efficacy and safety in patients with covid-19 21 a short-term study with 53 covid-19 patients showed that after 18 days remdsivir treatment 47 patients 2553 had been discharged from hospital total mortality was 13 overall clinical improvement was 68 however this uncontrolled respective study makes outcomes lack strong evidence 22 in this situation the first double-blind randomized clinical trial of remdesivir was conducted in severe covid-19 patients in wuhan china the results indicated that remdesivir treatment had clinical improvement in severe covid-19 patients with symptom duration no more than 10 days 17 the outcomes of another multicenter rct of remdesivir in covid-19 patients has present a significant shorten in duration of discharge from hospital without significant difference in mortality 17 according to these studies we still do not know the benefit or harm of remdesivir treatment in severe covid-19 patients however further studies of remdesivir in patients with covid-19 in higher dosage or combination with other antivirals agents might help us to better understand its potential mechanism and clinical efficacy the reproductive toxicity and the hemolytic anemia is the most serious side effects of ribavirin some cohort studies of ribavirin showed that patients on therapy with loading dose of ribavirin experience significant toxic and side effects such as hemolytic anemia 25 in another retrospective study among the 126 patients who received loading dose of ribavirin2000 mg treatment the mainly adverse drug reactions included hemolytic bleeding bradyarrhythmia14 and elevated transaminase40 26 thus the dose of ribavirin need to be carefully adjusted to treat patients with covid-19 ribavirin is only approved by fda for hepatitis c human respiratory syncytial virus rsv and some hemorrhagic fevers in combination with pegylated interferon in china ribavirin is used for the patients with covid-19 which is mentioned innovel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment schemetrial edition fifth issued by the chinese government 27 it is recommended to use ribavirin in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir the dosage for adults is 500 mg per time 23 times per day by intravenous infusion and the course of treatment is no longer than 10 days the clinical studies in hong kong have shown that ribavirin couldnt improve clinical outcome of patients with sars-cov 28 in 20 mers-cov infected patients a combination treatment of ribavirin and ifn- showed significantly improved survival at 14 days but not at 28 days 29 although ribavirin has shown a certain effect on mers-cov it is still controversial 3031 in china ribavirin was chosen for patients with covid-19 in combination with ifn or lopinavirritonavir according to the clinical guidelines 27 a clinical trial showed the significantly antiviral effect of combination treatment of ribavirin and ifn- on patients with mers-cov 32 but the adverse reaction of decreasing hemoglobin in infected patients reduces its potential antiviral agent against covid-19 take consideration of limited efficacy of ribavirin against coronaviruses and toxicity in vivo some medical team stop ribavirin treatment and related studies the most serious side effect of favipiravir is teratogenicity in the phase iii of a japanese and international multi-center clinical trial with 501 patients the main adverse reactions including rising uric acid24 cases 479 diarrhea24 cases 479 neutropenia9 cases 180 increased ast9 cases 180 and increased alt8 cases 160 34 in a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir with 240 patients with covid-19 the most common adverse events were liver enzyme abnormalities psychiatric gastrointestinal symptoms and serum uric acid elevations0001 35 the overall adverse reactions were mild symptoms but pregnant woman should not be treated with favipiravir favipiravir is approved in japan for treatment of new or recurrent influenza favipiravir was approved for treatment of covid-19 on february 15 2020 in china and also became the first approved drug for covid-19 the recommended mode of administration in china is 1200 mg400 mg with 1200 mg every time on the first day twice a day and 400 mg every time from the second to fifth days twice a day in 2014 favipiravir was urgently used to treat ebola virus and achieved good results 3637 in 2020 favipiravir showed cytotoxicity in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 at ec50 of 6188 m 20 a recent randomized clinical trial revealed that favipiravir had a clinical recovery rate of day 7 and led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia difference 170 days p  00001 and cough difference175 days p  00001 compared to arbidol 35 an open-label control study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of covid-19 was conducted with 80 patients 38 the favipiravir arm had a shorter viral clearance time versus the control arm median 4 days vs 11 days p  0001 and also had a higher rate of improvement in chest imaging 9143 vs 62 p  0001 in addition patients with covid-19 have been recruited to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon-chictr2000029600 chictr chinese clinical trial register favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil chictr2000029544 favipiravir plus tocilizumabchictr2000030894 and favipiravir plus chloroquine phosphatechictr2000030987 etc the clinical trials registered indicate that the combination therapy of favipiravir with other drugs may be a promising option for covid-19 patients a retrospective analysis with kaletra for 60 weeks showed that diarrhea nausea and vomiting are the main adverse reactions 40 a retrospective study with 417 patients with covid-19 revealed that the use of lopinavirritonavir lead to increased odds of liver injury or from 444 to 503 both p  001 41 another study revealed that lopinavirritonavir has an uncertain antiviral effect and even some potentially severe side effects in solid organ transplant recipients with covid-19 42 lopinavirritonavir have a synergistic effect on tacrolimus resulting in higher trough blood concentrations of tacrolimus and cause severe liver and kidney dysfunction and also greatly damage the function of the immune system 43 kaletra was previously approved by fda for aids in 2000 in 2020 kaletra was chosen as clinical candidate for the treatment of covid-19 in the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition fifth issued by chinese government the medication for adult patients with covid-19 is lopinavir 400 mgritonavir 100 mg twice a day for no less than 10 days 27 the dosage for children is adjusted according to body weight 12 mgkg for 7-15 kg and 10 mgkg for 15-40 kg with the maximum dose of 400100 mg per time as early as 2003 kaletra was considered as a clinical option for the treatment of sars and it indeed showed antiviral effect on sars both in tissues and patients 44 one clinical research in hong kong showed that kaletra reduced the mortality rate of sars-cov from 156 to 23 but it mainly exhibited good effect on patients with mild symptoms 45 the in vitro study revealed that lopinavir had antiviral effect in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 with ec50 of 2663 m 46 a recently published research showed that no benefit was observed with kaletera treatment in patients with severe covid-19 as compared with standard supportive care alone 47 a multicenter prospective open-label phase 2 trial with 127 covid-19 patients revealed that triple combination of interferon beta-1b lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 48 a randomized controlled open-label trial with 199 covid-19 patients revealed that no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard care however the secondary outcomes of this trial showed that the 28-day mortality was numerically lower in the lopinavirritonavir group than in the standard care group and the lopinavirritonavir group had shorter stay in the intensive care unit icu 49 it seems that the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir with interferon -1b and ribavirin or other drugs could have better effect than lopinavir-ritonavir alone the therapeutic and toxic dose of cqhcq is narrow the main toxicological outcomes initiated by cq and hcq reported are related to retinopathy neuromyopathy and cardiomyopathy after long term use 51 the doses used for covid-19 are often much higher than the treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases 52 thus the improper use of cq or hcq can easily cause serious side effects a phase iib clinical trial with 81 covid-19 patients showed that creatine phosphokinase ck and creatine kinase-mb ckmb levels were elevated in 13 of 33 patients 394 and 10 of 26 patients 384 respectively hemoglobin decrease was observed in 11 of 42 patients 262 and creatinine increase was observed in 16 of 38 421 no apparent hematological or renal toxicity were seen among these patients 53 cq is a widely used drug for malaria and autoimmune diseases and it has been used for over 70 years in 2020 cq was recommended for the therapy of covid-19 in the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition sixth issued by chinese government 54 cq phosphate is applicable to patients aged 18 to 65 the administration mode for patients weighing over 50 kg is 500 mg per time twice a day with 7 days treatment for those weighing no greater than 50 kg is 500 mg per time twice a day for the first and second days and 500 mg per time once a day for the third to seventh days with 7 days treatment it was reported in 2004 that chloroquine can effectively inhibit sars coronavirus at the cellular level 55 in 2020 chinese researchers revealed that chloroquine had the ec90 of 690 m for vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 20 a chinese clinical trial with more than 100 covid-19 patients found that chloroquine had superior to the control group in reducing symptom duration exacerbation of pneumonia including radiological improvement and promoting virus-negative seroconversion without any severe side effects 56 another randomized clinical trial with 81 adult patients suggested that the higher cq dosage 600 mg cq twice daily for 10 days should not be recommended for critically ill patients with covid-19 because of its potential safety hazards 53 a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 1438 hospitalized covid-19 patients revealed that treatment with hydroxychloroquine azithromycin or both compared with neither treatment was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality 57 a comparative observational study with 181 covid-19 patients suggested that hydroxychloroquine should not be recommended to be used in covid-19 patients who require oxygen 58 multinational registry analysis of cq and hcq for 96032 covid-19 patients revealed that cqhcq independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality 59 despite many observational studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of cqhcq we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors making it difficult to judge the therapeutic effect of cqhcq in an systematic review including 8 studies116 patients of mers-cov treatment by interferon interferon- combined with ribavirin caused adverse reactions two patients had increase in pancreatic enzyme and one patient had obvious hemolysis after the treatment of interferon-2a combined with ribavirin 60 interferon- ifn- is generally used for the treatment of malignant tumors and the prevention and treatment of virus through improving the immune function of human body 61 the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition seventh issued by chinese government recommended that ifn- aerosol inhalation can be used for antiviral treatment of covid-19 62 the administration mode for adults is 5 million u or equivalent dose with 2 ml sterile water for injection by aerosol inhalation twice a day the in vitro study showed that both ifn- and ifn- exhibited antiviral effect on mers-cov and sars-cov 6364 ifn in combination with ribavirin showed better antiviral effect than ribavirin alone in the renal cell line of rhesus monkey infected with mers-cov 65 a clinical study compared the clinical effects of ifn- combined with glucocorticoid and glucocorticoid alone in the treatment of sars-cov patients 66 the results showed that the symptomatic relief time in pulmonary imaging of interferon- group was shortened by 50 p  0001 and the oxygen saturation was significantly improved a recent triple therapy study of interferon beta-1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin presented that remarkable differences were observed in symptom alleviation shorten the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in combination group 48 however more clinical benefits and potential anti-cytokine approaches of ifn are still under investigated for covid-19 the overall adverse effect of arbidol is mild the commonly adverse drug reactions was nausea abdominal discomfort nausea with headache and leucopenia increased akp and increased total bilirubin the retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol treatment for covid-19 patients revealed that no apparent side effect was observed during the therapy 67 arbidol was first approved in russia in 1993 for the treatment of influenza now the drug is marketed in china and russia for the treatment of upper respiratory infection caused by influenza a and b viruses arbidol is recommended for the treatment of covid-19 in the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition sixth 54 the administration mode for adults is 02 g per time 3 times a day with the treatment lasting up to 10 days in 2019 arbidol received extensive attention due to the outbreak of covid-19 early studies have shown that arbidol has an effect of inhibiting the early replication of sars virus in vitro 68 recent study reported that arbidol efficiently inhibited sars-cov-2 infection in vitro with ec50 of 411 m which suggested arbidol might have potential for the treatment of covid-19 patients 69 a retrospective study was performed to evaluate the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavirritonavir and arbidol in 50 covid-19 patients which indicated that arbidol group had a shorter viral load compared to those in the lopinavirritonavir group p  001 and may have better antiviral effect than lopinavirritonavir 67 another retrospective study with 81 covid-19 patients revealed that arbidol group had longer hospital stay than the control group and the median time for turning negative was similar with the control which suggested that arbidol might not improve the prognosis or accelerate sars-cov-2 clearance 70 however one research with 69 enrolled covid-19 patients revealed that arbidol had tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate 71 lianhuaqingwen lh is mainly used to treat influenza which showed antiviral activity and clinical improvement on series of influenza viruses the relieved symptoms include fever or hyperpyrexia aversion to cold muscular soreness nasal obstruction running nose cough headache and so on the recommended dosage for adults is 4 capsules per time 035 g powercapsule three times a day since the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic chinese doctors have used lh to treat patients with common and severe covid-19 as a potential treatment agent against sars-cov-2 lh showed excellent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity on novel coronavirus in vitro 72 another human rct presented that standard antiviral therapy combined with lh can significantly improve the symptoms of covid-19 such as fever cough and fatigue in most of common covid-19 patients relieve the pneumonia symptoms and significantly shorten the duration of pneumonia symptoms without observed serious adverse events 73 this provides a preliminary evidence of the antiviral activity of lh for covid-19 lh and other traditional chinese medicines have also played a positive role in antiviral efficacy against sars-cov-2 during pandemic at present convalescent blood products are mainly used for acute and severe virus infections without available vaccine or specific therapy such as sars-cov mers-cov ebola etc the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition seventh recommended convalescent plasma therapy for serious and extreme cases of covid-19 62 in 2015 a systematic analysis of the treatment of sars-cov with convalescent plasma and hepatitis b immune globulin was reported 75 evidences continuously proved that convalescent blood products can reduce the total mortality of sars-cov especially in the early stage of symptoms the clinical trials of convalescent plasma are undergoing for the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 a case series study of convalescent plasma showed that the clinical symptoms were significantly relieved within 3 days of treatment suggesting that the plasma was effective in treating severe covid-19 patients 76 the convalescent plasma is considered to have possible source of specific antibodies for pathogen however it can also be challenging due to the limited serum with sufficiently high antibody and small sample size convalescent plasma therapy could be a valid option for severe covid-19 patients when a specific treatment is not available mesenchymal stem cells mscs are multipotent cells isolated from diverse mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrow umbilical cord adipose tissue 77 mscs can enlarge the proportion of regulatory t cells and decrease pro-inflammatory factors such as il-6 and tnf- which have a great potential to improve the outcome of covid-19 patients 78 the immunomodulating effects of mscs have been proven on avian influenza viruses 79 more than 10 clinical trials had been registered to estimate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for covid-19 patients in the world a clinical study significantly improved functional outcomes without obvious adverse effects in 7 covid-19 patients 80 the vaccine could be urgently needed to protect against covid-19 worldwide recently scientists played great efforts for the development of covid-19 vaccine with safety and efficacy as of june 242020 there are 16 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation which are composed of dna rna non-replicating viral vector inactivated virus and recombinant proteins81 the first sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine mrna-1273 encoding s protein launched phase i nct04283461 clinical trial which 15 participants seroconverted by day 15 and 8 participants all developed neutralizing antibodies 82 ad5-cov vaccine was viral vector vaccines chictr2000030906nct04313127 developed by chen wei group which the neutralizing antibodies increased significantly at day 14 and peaked 28 days post-vaccination83 protein vaccines such as nvx-cov2373 nct04368988 usually had high cost low immunogenicity but high safety and scalability despite great efforts have been made for vaccine development completion dates for early clinical trials have not been estimated and it may still take longer before a vaccine is licensed for use globally besides the drugs introduced above there are many promising drugs registered with the intention of discovering effective treatments triazavirintzv is a broad spectrum antiviral drug the clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of triazavirin for covid-19 was performed in chinachictr2000030001 but the outcomes of this trial have not been reported danoprevir is a potent hcv protease ns34a inhibitor approved by cfdachina food and drug administration to treat chronic hepatitis c patients a clinical study showed that danoprevir ritonavir could significantly improve respiratory symptoms and obvious lung absorption of covid-19 patients 84 oral ll-37 antiviral peptide cas001 was another promising candidate and had been used for clinical trial with 11 covid-19 patients the preliminary result showed that cas001 had definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms of covid-19 85 baloxavir marboxil is a recently developed antiviral prodrug whose metabolite selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease of the influenza virus polymerase acidic protein a randomized controlled trial showed that baloxavir marboxil had antiviral activity in vitro with ec50 of 548 m but lacked of virological effect and clinical benefits partly due to insufficient concentrations or the poor antiviral effect in vivo 86 danorevirritonavir was the first protease inhibitor-based single-tablet regimen str available for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged  12 years with hiv-1 infection this drug was also used for clinical trial to assess the efficacy for the treatment of covid-19 but the results have not been reported 87 many other promising drugs were also under clinical trials for covid-19 patients such as emtritabine ftctenofovir alafenamide fumarate tablets tafchictr2000029468 azvudine ganovoritonavirchictr2000030000 asc09ritonavirchictr2000029603 tranilastchictr2000030002 et al further studies of their efficacy and safety for inhibiting sars-cov-2 in humans needs to be investigated the pandemic of covid-19 has made an unprecedented crisis for public health and economy both in china and other countries scientists worldwide struggle to seek efficacious covid-19 treatments to control the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 numerous drugs have been used in clinical practice to estimate their efficacy and safety for covid-19 patients the various clinical trials in patients with these drugs may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit as diagnosis and treatment program of covid-19 developed rapidly the therapeutic strategies are quite different in many counties as the most attractive and promising antiviral agents lopinavirritonavir remdesivir and cqhcq have presented potential antiviral activities against covid-19 for patients with severe or mild covid-19 no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard care 4788 however the triple combination of interferon -1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavirritonavir alone for patients with mild to moderate covid-19 patients indicating the combination therapy may increase the efficacy and safety of lopinavirritonavir 48 a result of rct indicated that remdesivir alone had clinical improvement in severe covid-19 patients with shorten duration of hospital stay but no statistically clinical benefits and difference in mortality were observed however some scientists gave hope to the combination of remdesivir with other drugs such as tocilizumab thus further studies of combination treatment with stronger evidences are needed the therapeutic and toxic dose of cqhcq is so narrow that the improper use of cq or hcq can easily cause serious side effects many european countries approved cqhcq only for clinical trials but not for the treatment for covid-19 patients because of the unsatisfied efficacy and the potential toxicity of cqhcq however a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred too early according to the observational studies according to anti-coronaviruses activity and better coronaviruses clearance of favipiravir double- and triple-therapy include favipiravir is recommended for mild or moderated covid-19 patients as it is associated with cardiovascular reaction and hepatotoxicity that ribavirin is not recommended for mild covid-19 traditional chinese medicine such as lh played an important role during this epidemic for patients both in fangcang shelter hospital and covid-19 designated infectious disease hospitals the combination treatment of lh and standard antiviral agents could somehow relieve symptoms and reduce the time of recovery with mild patients other old drugs are under pre-clinical and clinical study for the treatment of covid-19 such as triazavirin danorevir baloxavir marboxil darunavircobicistat emtritabine ftctenofovir alafenamide fumarate tablets taf etc but few of them had solid evidence to support their efficacy and safety for covid-19 patients meanwhile the development of new drugs for covid-19 are still ongoing for instance the small peptides targeting ace2 small molecule interrupting the interaction of sars-cov-2 mpro 3clpro protease with other drugs 14 these new drugs displayed obvious antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo but their efficacy for covid-19 patients need to be further investigated biologics are considered to be the most promising drugs in the future due to their high specificity and efficacy biologics such as mesenchymal stem cells sars-cov-2-specific neutralizing antibodies vaccines have been used for clinical practice of covid-19 patients with the further clinical trials the safety and efficacy will be revealed for the rational options for the treatment of covid-19 despite many clinical trials have been conducted for the treatment of covid-19 no drug has been verified to be really effective for covid-19 to find the specific drugs for covid-19 multicenter clinical trials should be performed with enough enrolled patients to carefully analysis the clinical outcomes on the other hand new drugs such as small inhibitors ace2 peptide inhibitors or vaccines specific for sars-cov-2 are new hope for the treatment of covid-19 we believe that the numerous experiences reviewed in this paper will promote the development of effective drugs for covid-19 patients no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors  controversial treatments an updated understanding of the coronavirus disease 2019 cantong zhang shaoying huang fengping zheng yong dai   coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused a large outbreak in china with a high humantohuman transmission rate r0

 and a casefatality rate approximately 267 to date figures 1 2 3 to which people are generally susceptible more seriously the epidemic continued to spread from china to europe north america and other asian countries despite great efforts and an increasing number of people being cured in china the world health organization who announced the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 2 sarscov2 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30 january 2020 and raised the risk assessment of covid19 from high to very high at the global level on 28 february 2020

 the threat of global pandemics is real

 yang et al

 reported 52 critically ill adult patients with covid19 who could not survive the disease on 21 february 2020 most of whom faced organ function damage and needed extracorporeal support zhongnan hospital of wuhan university reported 138 hospitalized patients with covid19 most of these patients received antiviral therapy oseltamivir 124 899 glucocorticoid therapy 62 449 and 36 patients 261 were transferred to the intensive care unit icu of the 36 cases in the icu 15 417 received noninvasive ventilation and 17 472 received invasive ventilation four were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo
5
 the china medical treatment expert group for sarscov2 reported that 55 500 of 1099 laboratoryconfirmed patients were admitted to the icu and 15 136 succumbed severe pneumonia was independently associated with admission to the icu mechanical ventilation or death
6

 to reduce the casefatality rate and complication rate without registered treatment or a vaccine there is an urgent need for health care workers worldwide to review and propose experience and lessons from critical covid19 patients in a timely manner given the treatments mentioned above we will discuss antiviral therapy glucocorticoid therapy and extracorporeal support including ecmo and artificial liver system als available for the treatment of covid19 based on current published evidence furthermore we list a table to conclude the mechanism advantages and limitations for different treatments mentioned in this review table 2 remdesivir gs5734 has broadspectrum activities against viruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers and sars in both cell and animal trials

 in addition research revealed that remdesivir could inhibit viral infection effectively in a human cell line human liver cancer huh7 cells which is susceptible to sarscov2
11

 the mechanism of remdesivir against the virus showed that the drug effectively inhibited the ebola virus rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp complex
12
 
13
 the remdesivir could form remdesivir triphosphate remdesivirtp in vivo which was incorporated into the newly synthesized rna chain of the virus as the substrate of the virus rdrp thereby interrupting the transcription of the virus
12
 another study showed that remdesivirtp could compete with adenosine triphosphate atp
14
 after entering the cells a monophosphoramidate prodrug of remdesivir transformed into triphosphate metabolite ntp in three steps and ntp and atp competed to bind viral rdrp ntp was incorporated into the rna synthesis chain contributing to the termination of viral rna synthesis and inhibiting rdrp enzyme activity
12

 in addition remdesivir was used against a case of 2019 novel coronavirus reported in n engl j med leading to widespread interest
15
 in this case report a patient with covid19 was treated by intravenous remdesivir without apparent adverse reactions on the evening of the seventh day of hospitalization the patients clinical symptoms improved on the eighth day after hospitalization the 12th day after onset phase iii clinical trials of remdesivir had been completed for the treatment of ebola virus infection with complete data on human pharmacokinetics and safety
16
 recently phase iii randomized controlled trials were carried out to evaluate intravenous remdesivir for covid19 nct04252664 and nct04257656 which will be completed in april 2020 and may 2020 respectively
17
 
18
 remdesivir 100 mg except for the first day of 200 mg for 10 days with placebo in the phase iii trials which were initiated in china is worthy of concern about adverse reactions at this dose due to differences in ethnicity ribavirin is a broadspectrum nucleoside antiviral drug that is phosphorylated in virusinfected cells and its product acts as a competitive inhibitor of virus synthetase interfering with early viral transcription events and hindering the synthesis of ribonucleoproteins thereby hindering virus replication and spread in vitro four studies observed antiviral effects against sars
19
 
20
 
21
 
22
 but the results from cinatl et al
23
 and stroher et al
24
 showed no evidence of an antiviral effect moreover there was insufficient evidence of clinical effects after administration to sarsinfected patients
25
 
26
 and its side effects such as hemolytic anemia
26
 
27
 
28
 
29
 were found to be relatively strong in clinical applications which should be given close attention during treatment for covid19 in addition in the case of ribavirin the us food and drug administration fda approved its use for the treatment of human respiratory fusion virus
30
 particularly certain hemorrhagic fever the fda clearly stated that ribavirin was not suitable for the treatment of influenza and had strict indications during the covid19 epidemic ribavirin was indicated for the general treatment of covid19 in chinese treatment guidelines
31
 and it is recommended that ribavirin is combined with interferon as antiviral therapy according to cellular trials in sars and mers reported by morgenstern et al
21
 and falzarano et al
32
 the dosage of ribavirin can be reduced when combined with interferon due to their synergistic effect overall without domestic phase i and ii clinical trials ribavirin did not have statistical data on clinical safety and efficacy against syndromerelated coronavirus 2 specifically thus the clinical treatment of safety and ethical problems is worthy of attention the ability to interfere with virus infection and replication came from increasing the endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion and immunemodulating activity along with widespread distribution throughout the whole body including the lungs in vivo

33
 and biot et al

 reported that chloroquine and its derivatives inhibit viral replication in vitro as a potent inhibitor of sarscov in cell culture keyaerts et al

 reported that the halfmaximal inhibitory concentration of chloroquine for antiviral activity was significantly lower than its cytostatic activity which approximated that the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached the level of acute malaria treatment even up to 5 hours after infection against sarscovinfected vero e6 cells chloroquine could also interfere with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 one of the binding sites for s protein to inhibit sarscov infection
36
 in vitro the experiment also highlighted that chloroquine blocked covid19 virus infection at lowmicromolar concentrations
11
 with the possible mechanism of interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ace2 to negatively influence virusreceptor binding
37

 however there are several limitations for further clinical application in patients a most of the current research has been limited to cell culture and the animal models and potential adverse drug reactions such as cardiotoxicity and irreversible retinopathy should not be ignored
38
 the contraindications relative contraindications and pharmaceutical precautions are listed in table s1
39
 b a more clinical experiment must be supported to explicate the antiviral effect in patients infected with covid19 c after chloroquine is taken by oral administration most of it is metabolized in the liver since it is excreted slowly and maintained in plasma with a halflife of 25 to 10 days patients with liver dysfunction may be more likely to experience chloroquine accumulation in vivo according to the wuhan institute of virology the lethal dose of chloroquine in adults is 2 to 4 g and it is acute the expert consensus on chloroquine phosphate recommended that it was suitable for adults aged 18 to 65 with the dose depending on the weight of the patient table 1

 corticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of past coronavirus infections such as sars and mers and corticosteroids are also one of the methods for treating covid19
4
 
31
 
40
 
41
 however no evidence was found on the antiviral effect of corticosteroids alone in resisting sarscov in vitro
25
 in addition interim guidance from the who on the clinical management of suspected covid19 advised avoiding the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason given lack of their effectiveness
42
 because corticosteroids may cause harm avascular necrosis
43
 psychosis
44
 diabetes
45
 and delayed viral clearance
46
 as reported by some studies moreover an article published by russell et al
47
 recently in the lancet does not recommend the use of corticosteroids in treating covid19 in addition the study reported that 16 patients 44 with arrhythmia among the 36 severe patients diagnosed with covid19
5
 and another study showed that the proportion of acute cardiac injury in covid19 could reach 12
40
 moreover severe patients might have multiple organ dysfunction mod such as shock acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute heart injury acute kidney injury and even death
40
 mod could be due to the cytokine storm because the discovery that t cell excessive activation in pathologic examinations of covid19 with multiple organ failure by the team of fusheng wang
48
 and a similar cytokine storm reported by huang et al
40
 hence it was suggested to use appropriate corticosteroids for patients suffering from ards
49
 furthermore pathological studies of covid19 observed pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation implying that timely use of corticosteroids is necessary for severe patients
48
 which was also supported by retrospective pathologic examinations showing edema and proteinaceous exudate with globules in the lungs of two patients with covid19
50

 the als is one of an effective method for treating liver failure
51
 and its treatment mechanism is based on liver cell regeneration ability through a extracorporeal equipment als removes all kinds of harmful substances supplements necessary material improves the internal environment and temporarily replaces part of liver function to create good conditions for the regeneration of liver cells or while waiting for an opportunity for liver transplantation
52
 among the three types nonbiological biological and hybrid of artificial liver support systems artificial extracorporeal liver support therapy has been widely used in acute liver failure and has been proven to improve survival
53
 as mentioned above cytokine storm was associated with disease severity reported by a study which illustrated that gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf were found to be higher in patients who require icu admission
40
 moreover a retrospective study including 99 patients with covid19 showed that 17 patients suffered ards and among them 11 patients progressed rapidly and eventually died of multiple organ failure
49
 in these death cases timely treatment of critical cases is of vital significance
49
 in china lan juan li initially treated severe patients with an als called lials to eliminate inflammatory factors
54
 plasma exchange and continuous venovenous hemofiltration are the main components of the function of lials which is the treatment for severe patients with h7n9 virus infection when they worsen in a short period and a cytokine storm is detected
55
 
56
 in addition potential complications such as hemorrhage coagulation hypotension secondary infection allergic reaction disequilibrium syndrome and so on should be fully evaluated and prevented before als treatment is applied to any patient
52
 hence once a cytokine storm was found in covid19 extracorporeal blood purification techniques including als can be considered if conditions permit table 2 a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted at 20 hospitals in 2017 reported that ecmo was effective at improving oxygenation and ventilation of patients with h7n9induced severe ards
57
 a similar result of the positive effects of ecmo occurred in australia and new zealand during the h1n1 epidemic in 2009
58
 as a bridge between recovery and septic shock ecmo provides temporary respiratory circulation support to reduce ventilator parameters and avoid ventilatorrelated pressure and volume injuries it can partially replace myocardial function during the development of sepsis improve peripheral perfusion and oxygenation and provide an opportunity for primary disease treatment
59

 however it is not a treatment for the virus but a means of life support with many limitations a related accidents and complications may occur including bleeding infection hemolysis thrombosis limb ischemia multiple organ failure and even lifethreatening complications in severe cases
59
 some complications are hard to avoid and we should pay attention to prevention and early management to prevent the condition of patients with covid19 from detrimentally worsening b applying ecmo to each patient is costly due to the high manufacturing cost high operation cost and requirement for a specialist multidisciplinary team c there are only approximately 400 ecmo devices in china according to the peoples daily therefore critically ill patients with no underlying disease would be preferred coronavirus infection is a major public health problem worldwide and is mainly caused by respiratory infections including influenza and other acute respiratory viral diseases it is estimated that lower respiratory infections cause more than four million deaths each year approximately 40 of which are caused by respiratory viruses
60
 both merscov and sarscov have been known to cause severe illness in people and now an outbreak of covid19 has occurred this review will help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments in this review we summarize and discuss the controversial treatments that correspond to complications of critical covid19 patients without any specific antiviral treatments for sarscov2 currently some may be effective while others are in clinical trials or are being investigated in vitro studies remdesivir has shown antiviral activity against mers and sars at the cellular level and in animal models as well as antisarscov2 activity in vitro and it can be used as a potential 2019 novel coronavirus drug ribavirin is a broadspectrum nucleoside antiviral drug however the clinical effects are unclear and side effects should be considered regarding chloroquine there were 15 interventional studies and its derivatives were prospectively registered in the chinese clinical trial registry and further observations need to be evaluated regarding antiviral effect and recommended dose in patients infected with covid19 in addition to antiviral drugs glucocorticoids should be used carefully and in a timely manner in patients with covid19 extracorporeal support als and ecmo should be considered under strict indications and contraindications otherwise the waste of resources and additional complications will be enormous ecmo may be used more aggressively and many more ecmo devices could be transferred to hubei province in the future due to the temporary absence of effective antiviral drugs and the hope of reducing mortality in conclusion antiviral therapy and organ function support are most effective in reducing the mortality rate in patients with mild syndrome and patients in critical condition respectively the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests     a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has emerged around the globe causing a pandemic of coronavirus infectious disease  clinicians worldwide are urgently looking for investigational antiviral agents for benefit over supportive care alone remdesivir is an investigational drug that shows in vitro anti-viral activity against sars-cov-2 and a shorter time to clinical recovery in clinical trials 1 on may 1 2020 the us food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of covid-19 however because of the limited experience with remdesivir information about adverse drug reactions and possible drug-drug interactions is scarce we report a case of a critically ill patient with covid-19 who developed hepatotoxicity following remdesivir therapy we propose a relationship with a drug-drug interaction between remdesivir and p-glycoprotein inhibitors a 64-year-old male patient presented at our hospital with a 7-day history of fever headache cough and progressive dyspnea he had a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he used enalapril amlodipine and simvastatin he did not smoke or use illicit drugs his blood pressure was 14380 mmhg with a pulse rate of 80min his body temperature was 388 o c his respiratory rate 40min and oxygen saturation 88 while breathing room air the diagnosis of covid-19 was confirmed by a positive sars-cov-2 pcr of the nasopharynx and consolidations in both lungs on radiology assessment he was admitted to the hospital for oxygen therapy a 5-day chloroquine course was started loading dose 600 mg followed by 300mg bid according to national guidelines at that time due to respiratory insufficiency on day three he was transferred to the intensive care unit icu for mechanical ventilation the icu course was complicated by pulmonary embolism and icu acquired weakness on day 16 remdesivir was started as part of an extended access program a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t gs-us-540-582 2  because of new onset atrial fibrillation amiodarone was temporally given 700 mg on day 18 two days after initiation of remdesivir five days after start of remdesivir an acute increase in alanine transaminase alt and aspartate transaminase ast was seen alt was 1305 iul ast 1461 ul alkaline phosphatase 269 ul total bilirubin 8 moll gammaglutamyltransferase 227 ul and creatine kinase 103 ul remdesivir was immediately stopped resulting in a rapid decrease of alt and ast values to eventually normal levels  figure 1  on day 48 the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center two weeks hereafter he returned home and he was able to restart his normal daily activities we presented a case of drug-induced liver injury most likely caused by remdesivir remdesivir toxicity was suspected based on the time-relation the positive dechallenge the known in vitro toxicity of remdesivir and the absence of alternative causes of hepatotoxicity covid-19 has also been found to be associated with elevated liver enzymes 3  covid-19 could therefore be the cause of elevated alt seen in the period prior to remdesivir therapy figure 1  4  however the sudden alt peak occurred 27 days after the first onset of symptoms making viral replication of sars-cov-2 as a cause of acute hepatotoxicity very unlikely amiodarone-induced liver toxicity was considered less likely since acute amiodarone toxicity has an early onset within 24 hours and the given cumulative dose was low 5  furthermore given amiodarones very long half-life 26-107 days the rapid resolution which was seen after the initial elevation of alt makes a causative role of amiodarone unlikely several clinical studies described amino transaminase elevations following remdesivir therapy in healthy individuals grade 1 and 2 transaminase elevations were seen 6  in the prevail-iv study using remdesivir as treatment in 38 patients with ebola the remdesivir dose was reduced in one patient because of amino transaminase elevations 6  in contrast hepatotoxicity was not documented as a serious adverse event in 175 ebola patients receiving remdesivir in the palm study 7  in the actt-1 m a n u s c r i p t study hepatotoxicity defined as transaminase elevations of grade 1 or higher was seen less in covid-19 patients receiving remdesivir as compared to placebo 41 versus 59  1 in a study by goldman et al remdesivir was discontinued because of alt elevations in 30 of the patients 8 9  which according to the authors could also have been caused by covid-19 itself 9  on a cellular level it has been shown that remdesivir is toxic to human hepatocytes 6  the in vitro threshold concentration for remdesivir toxicity is 10 um which is only 11 times the maximal targeted therapeutic concentration 10  as such the upper limit of toxicity could be exceeded with a minor increase in hepatocellular concentration a possible cause for an increase in hepatocellular concentration and thereby an explanation for remdesivir toxicity could be an interaction between p-glycoprotein p-gp inhibitors and remdesivir p-gp is an efflux transporter located on the membrane of several humane cells including the hepatocytes in the hepatocyte p-gp transports xenobiotics out of the cell into the bile duct  figure   2  remdesivir has been identified to as a substrate for p-gp in vitro 6  a reduced efflux rate of remdesivir was observed in vitro in p-gp overexpressing cells in the presence of the p-gp inhibitor cyclosporine 10  therefore p-gp inhibitors could decrease the remdesivir efflux out of the hepatocyte resulting in a hepatocellular concentration above the toxic threshold the patient we described was treated with the p-gp inhibitors chloroquine last gift nine days before remdesivir half-life approximately two weeks and amiodarone concomitantly with remdesivir 11 12  the combination of these two agents with remdesivir could have increased the intrahepatocellular concentration above the toxicity threshold which caused the hepatocellular toxicity no studies investigating the influence of p-gp inhibition on remdesivir mediated hepatotoxicity have been performed yet m a n u s c r i p t   statistical issues and lessons learned from covid-19 clinical trials with lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesivir travis sanchez khairun nor aripin nain wenbin liang guosheng yin chenyang zhang huaqing jin   the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate since its outbreak in december 2019 more than 200 countries or territories have confirmed cases and over 84 million individuals have been infected leading to more than 450000 deaths as of june 18 2020 covid-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who on january 30 and declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 as recommended by the who rd blueprint expert group clinical improvements for patients with covid-19 can be classified in a seven-category ordinal scale 1 so far there are only eight clinical trials for covid-19 completed with results published among them two trials were for hydroxychloroquine with relatively small sample sizes 30 patients for the trial of chen et al 2 and 36 patients for the trial of gautret et al 3 although the trial conducted by gautret et al 3 yielded a significant result the sample size was too small to draw any convincing conclusion the trial of cai et al 4 compared favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir with a total sample size of 80 patients leading to a significant result p004 chen et al 5 conducted a trial comparing favipiravir with arbidol which had a total sample size of 240 patients and yielded an insignificant result the trial of grein et al 6 was a single-arm trial for remdesivir and the estimated clinical improvement rate at day 18 was 068 to determine the efficacy of lianhuaqingwen lhqw capsule a compounded chinese herb medicine hu et al 7 conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial and reported a statistically significant difference in the symptom fever fatigue coughing recovery rate between the treatment group and the control group 915 vs 824 p022 however the trial did not include a placebo in the control group to implement a double-blinding scheme despite the urgency nature of the pandemic their argument for unblinding due to ethical reasons seems to be unsound due to the conscious and subconscious psychological tendencies of humans including both clinicians and patients bias often arises in an open-label study not only does unblinding lead to potential selection bias but it may also cause placebo effects for patients who took lhqw 8-11 which thus shed doubts on the clinical benefits of lhqw in particular the rate of symptom recovery is related to disease relief or symptomatic manifestations such as fever fatigue and coughing soft end points for which placebo effects are known to be strong and more discernible 10 however the lhqw and control groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings hard end points for which placebo effects are less perceptible because generally placebos can neither alter the pathophysiology of the disease nor cure it we take the three randomized clinical trials conducted by cao et al 12 on lopinavir-ritonavir and by wang et al 13 and beigel et al 14 on remdesivir as examples to illustrate statistical issues and lessons learned as they have drawn great attention in the clinical community the lopinavir trial for suppression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in china 12 was conducted with record speed from january 18 to february 3 2020 the date of enrollment of the last patient patient recruitment up to a planned sample size is often the bottle neck of trial conduct this was not the case with severe covid-19 due to the abundance of hospitalized patients during that period of time in this trial eligible patients were randomized at a 11 ratio to either the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group 400 mg and 100 mg orally twice daily plus the standard care or the standard care alone for 14 days no placebo was used for blinding because no placebo was prepared due to the urgency of the trial therefore both patients and investigators were aware of the treatment identity each patient received following the who seven-ordinal scale 1 the primary end point adopted by the trial 12 was the time to clinical improvement which was defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points from the status at randomization eg from point 6 to point 4 or from point 5 to point 3 or live discharge from the hospital whichever came first the sample size was increased from 160 to 199 since the result with the enrolled 160 patients did not reach statistical significance as a final conclusion cao et al 12 reported no benefit with the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with a hazard ratio hr of 124 and the associated 95 ci 090-172 wang et al 13 conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial with remdesivir at ten hospitals in hubei china overall 236 patients were enrolled from february 6 to march 12 2020 and were randomly assigned to the remdesivir group 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 and the placebo group at a 21 ratio in the original design the trial planned to recruit 453 patients with 302 to remdesivir and 151 to placebo but no patients were enrolled after march 12 due to no eligible patients being available in the hubei province as a consequence the statistical power of the study was reduced from 80 to 58 the primary clinical end point was the time to improvement within 28 days clinical improvement was defined as a two-point improvement from an adjusted six-category ordinal scale from the who seven-category ordinal scale in conclusion remdesivir did not show statistically significant clinical benefit compared with the placebo in terms of the hr 123 95 ci 087-175 beigel et al 14 reported a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection this trial had a total sample size of 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 95 ci 9-12 days and 15 95 ci 13-19 days for the placebo group the rate ratio for recovery was 132 95 ci 047-104 p001 which was statistically significant in favor of remdesivir the kaplan-meier estimates of mortality at 14 days were 71 with remdesivir and 119 with the placebo and the hr for death was 070 95 ci 047-104 remdesivir was shown to be superior to the placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and in terms of the hr for death there was no significant difference between the two groups so far only one treatment remdesivir has been shown to be effective by a randomized clinical trial but the other remdesivir trial failed to demonstrate its superiority over the placebo as the pandemic of covid-19 will not be controlled anytime soon the aforementioned three clinical trials 12-14 provide extremely valuable information on the treatments of covid-19 and the corresponding trial design and analysis however several important issues have been identified in the statistical analysis design and implementation of the three trials we point out the statistical problems that arose in the three trials 12-14 and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves for the time to improvement or recovery using more appropriate approaches our in-depth and comprehensive analyses yield new insights on the design and analysis for ongoing and future covid-19 clinical trials the log-rank test 15 is the most commonly used method in survival analysis and clinical trial design to compare the survival benefit of two arms consider a randomized clinical trial with a planned sample size n1 using a two-sided log-rank test if the hypothesis test indicates no significant survival difference between the two groups under the significance level  but the trial decides to continue to enroll more patients up to a larger sample size n2 this would inflate the overall type i error of the trial any adjustment to the sample size during the trial should be planned and evaluated in advance to maintain the overall type i error rate let z1 and z2 denote the log-rank test statistics with sample sizes n1 and n2 respectively it holds that under the null hypothesis 1617 z1 and z2 jointly follow a multivariate normal distribution d1  dn1 and d2  dn2 are the expected numbers of events with sample sizes n1 and n2 and d is the proportion of patients experiencing the event thus the overall type i error rate  overall with the significance level  is  is the 1  th quantile of the standard normal distribution for clinical studies with a survival end point we are interested in the distribution of event time t in general patients will eventually experience the event with a long enough follow-up although the exact event time might not be observed due to censoring however for some diseases with long-term survivors it may happen that the event will never occur in a fraction of subjects ie the event time for cured subjects is infinity 18-21 under this situation patients can be divided into two groups the terminal or cure group the specified event would never occur and the nonterminal group the specified event would occur but possibly censored due to the end time of the study thus the distribution of the event time t has a point probability mass  at   is the group label taking a value of 1 if the individual is in the terminal group and 0 otherwise   p  1  pt   is the terminal rate and t follows a proper distribution with pt    1 for the covid-19 trials 1213 the cumulative incidence curve of t can be expressed by ft and ft are the cumulative distribution functions of t and t respectively note that pt    1    1 restricted mean survival time rmst 1622-26 is an alternative measure for the mean survival time that is not estimable due to the presence of censoring the rmst is equal to the expectation of the minimum value of event time t and the specified time point  which can be calculated as the area under the survival curve from 0 to  it can be estimated by the area under the kaplan-meier survival curve which has gained enormous popularity due to its robustness feature although the hr is the most popular statistic to quantify the survival difference in randomized clinical trials it is no longer an interpretable quantity if the proportional hazards ph assumption is violated 25 by contrast the rmst has the advantages of being nonparametric and model-free yet carrying clinically meaningful interpretations given the prespecified time point  the estimate of the rmst difference between two groups can be interpreted as the extra survival gain on average during the time  follow-up period clinical trials during the epidemic of an infectious disease might fail to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients if the outbreak can be quickly controlled 27 however early termination of a clinical trial would inevitably lead to loss of power and thus unconvincing findings based on the collected data the bootstrap method can be used to predict what would happen if the trial had continued to reach the desired sample size let n denote the desired sample size and n0 n0  n the actual number of patients enrolled the statistic of interest prediction can be conducted under either conditional or unconditional schemes the unconditional prediction draws n samples sampling with replacement from the original data with n0 observations while the conditional prediction draws n  n0 samples from the original n0 observations and keeps the original n0 samples intact by repeating the sampling procedure for a large number of times one can estimate the predicted mean and the corresponding confidence interval for the statistic of interest if the trial had continued to reach the sample size of n in the original analysis of cao et al 12 the time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28 and failure to reach clinical improvement or death before day 28 were considered as right-censored at day 28 in contrast to the usual survival analysis where death or a bad event such as disease progression is used as the event of interest a good event clinical improvement was adopted as the end point in this trial as a result the shorter time to reach clinical improvement the better cao et al 12 concluded no benefit of using the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with an hr of 124 95 ci 090-172 we carried out an in-depth and comprehensive investigation of the trial design in cao et al 12 and identified several key issues with the trial that might have hindered its success first the unplanned sample size increment from 160 to 199 would inflate the type i error rate for this trial we have n1160 n2199 d075 d1  160  075  120 d2  199  075  14925 and based on equation 2 overall071 when the nominal significance level is set as 05 that is the false-positive rate for this trial increased as high as 71 in contrast to the nominal level of 5 any sample size alteration or re-estimation should be planned in advance to control the type i error rate and maintain the integrity of a trial when the sample size reached 199 the trial was halted for enrollment because of the availability of another treatment remdesivir such termination of a trial was again unplanned and immature if there were not another agent available would the trial continue recruitment interestingly the remdesivir trial by wang et al 13 the same group of investigators as the lopinavir-ritonavir trial started 3 days later after the lopinavir-ritonavir trial was terminated in terms of the primary end point clinical improvement using two-level increment on a seven-category ordinal scale from baseline is ad hoc due to uneven clinical differences between adjacent scales for example it is ambiguous whether the status of a patient changing from point 5 to point 3 is equivalent to that of changing from point 6 to point 4 in addition live discharge from the hospital may occur from point 3 to point 2 or point 4 to point 2 which cannot be considered equivalent either thus choosing 2-point improvement on the clinical outcome scale is not a precise end point which ignores the 1-point improvement and the difference between 2-point and 3-point improvement instead we recommend death as a single and clean end point for such trials given the mortality rate was not low with patients who were hospitalized with severe covid-19 192 in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 250 in the standard care group the original analysis 12 treated death before day 28 as right-censored at day 28 no matter when death had occurred this may cause ambiguity because it cannot distinguish the situations where all deaths in one group occurred earlier while those in the other group occurred later as death is a terminal event a terminal or cure rate model would be more appropriate for analysis of such data a terminal rate model can be viewed as the counterpart of the traditional mixture cure rate model 18-21 which can be developed by slight modifications as death is a terminal event patients who died during the 28-day follow-up period would never reach the clinical improvement ie the time to clinical improvement was infinity denoted as  death can also be viewed as a competing risk for clinical improvement the upper panel of table 1 shows that there was neither any significant difference in the terminal rates between the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups or in the hr after excluding the terminal subjects who would eventually be absorbed in the death state from the mixture terminal rate model in particular the terminal rates including observed deaths as well as unobserved deaths that would occur after day 28 but were censored at day 28 were 2117 for the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 2991 for the standard care group with p16 and the hr for nonterminal subjects was 105 95 ci 078-142 p74 moreover the crossings of the cumulative event curves for the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups at days 10 and 16 in the second figure of cao et al 12 imply possible violation of the ph assumption when the ph assumption is not satisfied the hr from a cox model 29 is not clinically meaningful as an alternative the area above the curve in the second figure of cao et al 12 or the area under the inverted curve as shown in our figure 1 referred to as the restricted mean time to improvement rmti can be used to quantify treatment effect that requires no assumption such as ph 1622-26 as a model-free quantity the rmti up to 28 days can be interpreted as the average time to reach improvement in 28 days for which the shorter is the better the 28-day rmti difference between the two groups was 167 days 95 ci 362 to 028 p09 in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant the 7-day and 14-day rmtis are also presented in the lower panel of table 1 where the 14-day rmti showed some promising results for lopinavir-ritonavir yet further confirmation is needed tables 2 and 3 show the numbers on mortality and clinical improvement by day 28 across the two treatment groups respectively we carried out chi-square tests or fisher exact tests if some of the cell counts were smaller than 5 to examine any association between the outcomes and treatments for table 2 with 23 cells there is no association with p53 and if combining deaths in both earlier and later stages this leads to 22 cells with p32 and odds ratio 071 95 ci 036-140 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had 071 times odds to die by day 28 in comparison to those in the standard care group for table 3 with 24 cells there is no association with p11 and if combining all clinical improvement cases this leads to 22 cells with p53 and odds ratio 124 95 ci 064-240 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had 124 times odds to achieve clinical improvement by day 28 in comparison to those in the standard care group however none of the results are statistically significant wang et al 13 reported a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled remdesivir trial for patients with severe covid-19 based on an adjusted six-point ordinal scale of clinical status the primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as a 2-level decline from randomization similar to that in cao et al 12 in fact the two trials were conducted by the same group of investigators for which the shorter is the better patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir interferons and corticosteroids the hr between the remdesivir and placebo groups was 123 95 ci 087-175 indicating no significant difference overall 237 eligible patients were enrolled with 158 patients assigned to the remdesivir group and 78 patients to the placebo group under the intent-to-treat itt scheme the trial was stopped early and thus failed to reach the designated sample size 453 due to a lack of eligible patients similar to the trial by cao et al 12 deaths before day 28 were treated as right-censored observations at day 28 regardless of the actual occurrence time of deaths in wang et al 13 moreover a clinical improvement might not be observed due to death ie death is a terminal event and thus the terminal or cure rate model introduced earlier should be recommended for the survival analysis rather than the standard cox model the upper panel of table 4 indicates no significant difference in the terminal rates between the remdesivir and placebo groups in particular the terminal rates were 3149 for the remdesivir group and 4071 for the placebo group with p19 with the terminal subjects excluded the hr from the mixture terminal rate model was 092 95 ci 063-135 p67 which also showed no significant difference between the two groups due to the competing risk from death the end point might not be observed and thus the standard hazard concept is ambiguous and the hr does not have a meaningful interpretation anymore 30 in the second figure in wang et al 13 the curve for the cumulative improvement event of remdesivir is uniformly higher than that of the control indicating patients with remdesivir reached improvement faster than those in the control group the area above the cumulative incidence curve or equivalently the area under the survival curve up to 28 days in our figure 2 would be a reasonable quantity for evaluating the treatment efficacy using the reconstructed data from the second figure in wang et al 13 the rmti evaluated at day 28 was 2042 95 ci 1926-2157 days for the remdesivir group and 2131 95 ci 1973-2288 days for the placebo group as shown in the lower panel of table 4 the difference in rmtis was 089 days 95 ci 284 to 106 numerically favoring remdesivir but not statistically significant it can be interpreted that patients treated by remdesivir on average had an extra 089 days of improvement during the 28-day follow-up compared with those in the placebo group the 7-day and 14-day rmtis are also presented in the lower panel of table 4 and neither showed statistically significant results the trial was terminated without reaching the originally planned sample size 453 due to a lack of eligible patients with only 236 patients in the itt analysis the estimated hr was 123 95 ci 087-175 numerically favoring remdesivir which might not be reliable due to the underpowered study using the bootstrap method we can predict what would happen if the trial had continued to reach the full sample size or double the planned sample size table 5 shows both the unconditional and conditional predictions of the hr similar to sample size re-estimation using conditional power 31 in a two-stage design if the trial could have reached the designated sample size the hr from the conditional prediction shows the significant treatment effect of remdesivir with p02 and if the trial had enrolled twice of the target sample size both conditional and unconditional approaches result in significant differences under the 5 significance level thus a larger sample size may be needed to show the significant difference between remdesivir and placebo beigel et al 14 presented a preliminary report of the nct04280705 trial which is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement this trial enrolled 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the primary end point of the original analysis was the recovery time defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 95 ci 9-12 days and that of the placebo group was 15 95 ci 13-19 days the rate ratio of recovery for remdesivir vs placebo was 132 95 ci 112-155 p001 which demonstrated the superiority of remdesivir in terms of the hr for death there was no significant difference between the remdesivir and placebo groups with an hr of 070 95 ci 047-104 the remdesivir trial of beigel et al 14 is essential to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir as it had a large sample size of 1059 patients under a well-designed randomized controlled trial scheme in terms of the data analysis beigel et al 14 only reported the median recovery time without a p value from the second figure in beigel et al 14 the kaplan-meier curves of cumulative recoveries are initially intertwined and then diverge so other percentiles of the time to recovery would provide more information on the efficacy of remdesivir meanwhile a global and robust measurement the restricted mean time to recovery rmtr can help to quantify the treatment efficacy in a more comprehensive way 1622-26 the upper panel of table 6 presents the rmtrs up to day 30 for both the remdesivir and placebo groups the rmtrs were 145 days and 172 days for remdesivir and placebo respectively indicating that patients with remdesivir on average had 27-day gains of recovery with 30-day follow-ups the difference in rmtrs was statistically significant with p001 demonstrating the superiority of remdesivir this is consistent with the original analysis in terms of the rate ratio of recovery 14 meanwhile in the bottom panel of table 6 more percentiles of the time to recovery were reported with p values the early difference for remdesivir vs placebo in the recovery time at the 25th percentile was 1 95 ci 3 to 0 p65 which was not statistically significant however the differences manifested to be statistically significant later for example the 30th to 60th percentiles of the recovery time in the remdesivir group were all significantly shorter than those in the placebo group it is reasonable for the treatment to take effect after a certain length of follow-up when designing and conducting a clinical trial for new treatment particularly for the covid-19 pandemic without knowing much about the clinical outcomes many things can go wrong if the design is not well thought out the trial is not carefully conducted following the protocol or the analysis is not properly carried out critical issues with such trials include but are not limited to the end point selection the type i error rate control double blinding or open label early termination of a trial the validity of the ph assumption in a cox model and assumptions for statistical tests and models in contrast to searching for a needle in a haystack the trial design should be more targeted focused and tailored for specific needs of patients with covid-19 and particular disease characteristics and severities 32 given the emergency and the fast spread of the coronavirus around the world it is crucial to design the right clinical trial and accelerate the development of a new treatment with the high speed of enrollment and urgency of the trial outcome it appears to be difficult to carry out any adaptation during the trial conduct the trial outcomes unfold so fast that any adaptation may not be able to catch up with the speed of recruitment as a summary our recommendations for covid-19 trials are although adaptive design has gained much popularity and is playing an increasingly important role in clinical trials particularly in oncology the advantages of adaptive design may be mitigated to a large extent under such a fast patient enrollment because the impact of any adaptation may be too slow to manifest before the trial is completed in such cases the consort consolidated standards of reporting trials statement 3334 can provide a general guideline for the trial design and conduct as a result our recommendations follow the gold standard scheme of conventional trial design without much adaptation ingredient which may

31-year chinese male originating from wuhan and reporting flu-like symptoms for 6 days was diagnosed with covid-19 on january 24 5 days after his arrival in paris he was immediately hospitalized with mild lymphopenia 1000 gl thrombopenia 146 gl and no abnormalities on chest x-ray the rt-qpcr on nasopharyngeal samples was positive with a sars-cov-2 viral load vl at 105 log10 copiesml on illness day 10 he was referred to intensive care unit icu due to oxygen saturation worsening po258mmhg flow nasal cannula 4 lmin and bilateral lung ground glass and alveolar opacities on chest ct-scan with no increase in vl remdesivir was started on january 29 2020 illness day 11 and was stopped at day 15 because of alamine aminotransferase alt elevation 195uil versus 46uil before remdesivir administration and a maculopapular rash a rapid decline of viral load from 276 ct to undetectability at day 2 of remdisivir infusion was observed skin and liver abnormalities improved within three days after discontinuing treatment the patient was discharged on february 12 an 80-year-old tourist originating from hubei province with past medical history of thyroid cancer presented on january 25 with fever and diarrhea for 4 days the chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities but he did not fulfill the covid-19 case definition at the time airborne and contact precautions were observed and the covid-19 diagnosis was eventually retained 3 days later on january 26 an acute respiratory failure with multiple organ failures triggered his admission to icu a broad spectrum antibiotherapy was started and adapted for coinfection with a susceptible acinetobacter baumannii diagnosed on multiplex pcr and j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f confirmed by tracheal aspirates culture and an aspergillus flavus tracheal aspirates culture remdesivir was started on january 29 but was discontinued on january 31 as the patient needed renal replacement therapy the nasopharyngeal viral load decreased from 210 ct before infusion to 289 on day 2 of infusion ct-scan on january 31 showed bilateral alveolar condensations ground glass and pulmonary cysts on february 5 because of the disease severity and the persistence of viral detection remdesivir was re-initiated multiple organ failures persisted without any other coinfection identified he died on february 14 a 39-year old male airport worker obese bmi33kgm 2  and with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was diagnosed with severe covid-19 and admitted to icu on february 26 he had cough and fever since february 21 he presented an acute respiratory

load was already very low at 385 ct but remdesivir was initiated on march 3 and discontinued on march 12 without any side effect as sars-cov-2 vl was constantly negative he was weaned off oxygen on illness day 19 and discharged on illness day 23  this case series of five covid-19 patients requiring icu for a respiratory distress treated with remdesivir three 1 3 4 had a favorable outcome despite the initial respiratory severity they were weaned off oxygen between illness day 14 to 19 and discharged between illness day 20 and 26 patients 2 and 5 died in icu on illness day 25 and 31 with multiorgan failure remdesivir initiation yielded a decrease in nasopharyngeal vl in all but patient 2 for whom the treatment was re-introduced after an early interruption without additional decrease neither in upper nor lower respiratory tract for patient 5 a viral replication was still ongoing in the lower respiratory tract despite a concomitant undetectable vl in the nasopharyngeal area thus highlighting the discrepancies between viral replication in upper and lower respiratory tract among the most severe patients plasma samples were only positive for sars-cov-2 for patient 2 as described

outbreak in wuhan china in december 2019 the world has witnessed the pandemic spread of the newly identified betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that is responsible for coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 1 2 3 after a few sporadic cases in nine european countries italy became one of the western countries with the highest number of diagnosed cases 203591 as of 29 april 2020 with the greatest outbreak occurring in the region of lombardy 75134 cases 45 sars-cov-2 spreads from human to human transmission by means of respiratory droplets or direct contact and has a median incubation period of 51 days and a basic reproduction number of 224-358 67 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 ranges from mild disease ie the absence of pneumonia or mild pneumonia in about 80 of cases to life-threatening pneumonia in the form of acute respiratory disease syndrome ards requiring intensive care in 6 8 9 10 11 the case fatality rate cfr seems to vary and reported estimates range from 1 to 7 but this should be more precisely known once surveillance studies have clarified the number of infected subjects 12 13 given the severity and expected high cfr of the pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 it is imperative to find an effective drug treatment because supportive care and oxygen supplementation is not always enough remdesivir a nucleoside pro-drug that is thought to act by inhibiting viral rna transcription has shown in vitro antiviral activity against bat coronavirus and sars-cov-2 and has been safely used in one patient with sars-cov-2 pneumonia in the usa 14 15 16 17 this study evolved in the context of the emergency caused by the large outbreak of covid-19 in lombardy italy that started on 20 february 2020 on 21 february the pharmaceutical company gilead sciences agreed to a request for the donation of remdesivir for compassionate use in individual patients seriously affected by sars-cov-2 pneumonia and hospitalised at luigi sacco hospital milan italy a report containing the clinical information and laboratory test results of each eligible patient requiring oxygen supplementation was sent to gilead for approval enrolment in the programme ended on march 20 2020 as it was planned to start a randomised controlled double- blind clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalised patients with mild to moderate covid-19 respiratory disease 18 pending the results of this trial we report the outcomes of 35 patients who received compassionate remdesivir treatment during the first days of the italian sars-cov-2 epidemic patients were eligible to receive remdesivir for compassionate use if they were a male or non-pregnant female aged 18 years had sars-cov-2 infection confirmed by a positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test of a respiratory tract sample and pneumonia confirmed by a chest x-ray or computed tomography ct scan and were mechanically ventilated or had an oxygen saturation sao2 level of 94 in room air or a national early warning score news2 of  4 19 patients were excluded if their alanine or aspartate aminotransferase level was 5 times the upper limit of the normal range and creatinine clearance was 30 mlmin urgent approval for each eligible patient was obtained by our ethics committee and sent to gilead together with the patients clinical history written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients except those who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for whom the principle of urgency was applied the patients were prospectively enrolled in the remdesivir treatment programme between 23 february and march 20 2020 fig 1
 the drug schedule was an intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by an intravenous dose of 100 mgday from day 2 to day 10 the patients could continue their existing treatments including hydroxychloroquine hcq but had to discontinue lopinavirritonavir lpvr in accordance with gileads recommendations the clinical and laboratory data of all of the patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir were collected on a daily basis from the date of enrolment to the date of discharge death or censoring 20 april 2020 fig 2
 in a subset of patients a semi-quantitative rt-pcr test of a nasopharyngeal swab was carried out at baseline and during remdesivir treatment using an automated elite ingenius system and the genefinder covid-19 plus realamp kit elitechgroup france the reaction mix was manually prepared in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and loaded on to the system with other reagents and rna was extracted from 200 l of sample and eluted in 100 l the final reaction volume consisted of 5 l of rna plus 15 l of reagent mix the rt-pcr profile was 50 c for 20 minutes 95 c for five minutes plus 45 cycles at 95 c for 15 seconds and 58 c for 60 seconds in accordance with the manufacturers instructions three target genes rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nucleocapsid protein n and envelope membrane protein e were simultaneously amplified and tested viral load was measured as the cycle threshold ct value the primary outcome was the change in the patients hospitalisation status on the 10th and 28th day of treatment hospitalisation status was assessed using a 7-category ordinal scale previously used in influenza studies 20 in which 1  not hospitalised capable of resuming normal activities 2  not hospitalised but unable to resume normal activities 3  hospitalised not requiring oxygen supplementation 4  hospitalised and requiring oxygen therapy 5  hospitalised an requiring high-flow nasal oxygen therapy non-invasive mechanical ventilation or both 6  intensive care unit icu hospitalisation requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo or both 7  deceased the secondary outcome was safety including adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation adverse events were classified using the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events version 40 continuous variables are expressed as median values and their interquartile range iqr and were compared using the non-parametric mann-whitney test categorical variables are expressed as absolute numbers and percentages and were compared using fishers exact test friedmans test was used for paired samples as shown in fig 1 by day 10 of rendesivir treatment four 222 of the icu patients showed an improvement in their hospitalisation status one was still hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and three had been weaned from invasive ventilation ten 555 were still undergoing invasive ventilation and four 222 had died by the 28 day of follow-up the hospitalisation status of 389 of the icu patients had improved six had been discharged one had been weaned from invasive ventilation 167 were still undergoing mechanical ventilation and the other 444  had died among the idw patients the hospitalisation status of 6 353 had improved by day 10 of remdesivir treatment one had been discharged three no longer required oxygen supplementation and two were still hospitalized but no longer required high-flow therapy andor non-invasive mechanical ventilation but 10 still required high-flow therapy andor non-invasive mechanical ventilation and one had died by day 28 of follow-up hospitalisation status had improved in 882 of the idw patients 14 had been discharged one no longer required oxygen supplementation but one still required high-flow therapy andor non-invasive mechanical ventilation the news2 and laboratory test results of fourteen icu and 15 idw patients could be assessed on day 10 of remdesivir treatment there were no statistically significant changes from baseline in news2 in either group but the idw patients although not the icu patients showed a statistically significant improvement in fio2 values p  0046 moreover there was a statistically significant increase in lymphocyte counts in both the icu and idw groups p0001 and p  0001 and a statistically significant decrease in c-reactive protein levels p  0002 and p  0001 twenty-one of the 35 enrolled patients seven icu and fourteen idw patients were tested for sars-cov-2 viral load on a nasopharyngeal swab at baseline and during treatment the overall median value at baseline was 25 ct 27 in the icu and 25 in the idw patients and 22 had a negative viral load a median of 12 days iqr 925  1675 after the start of remdesivir treatment 
table 2
shows severe adverse events recorded during remdesivir treatment the most frequent was hepatotoxicity with a grade 3-4 increase in transaminases levels observed in 428 of the patients the most frequent adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation was acute kidney injury which was observed in four patients all in icu three of whom eventually died remdesevir was also discontinued in three patients showing a grade 3-4 increase in transaminase levels and in one patients who developed a serious maculo-papular rash the pandemic emergence of sars-cov-2 infection which is characterised by progressively severe pneumonia and ards that leads to a high mortality rate among hospitalised patients challenges the medical community to evaluate rapidly any possibly effective antiviral drug 21 on the basis of in vitro studies of different coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 it seems that a number of drugs may be candidate treatment options including lpvr chloroquine hcq and remdesivir 14 15 1622 23 24 25 one randomised controlled trial of lpvr involving hospitalised patients with severe covid-19 has failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit 26 remdesivir a broad-spectrum antiviral drug used in the treatment of ebola virus has shown in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 16 and various phase ii and iii randomised clinical trials of parenteral remdesivir involving patients with mild-to-moderate and severe covid-19 are currently ongoing in europe and the usa 18 so far two single case reports and a multinational compassionate treatment study have suggested a beneficial effect of remdesivir for patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia 172728 conversely in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted in china remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant beneficial clinical outcome with severe covid-19 pneumonia 29 this later study however has been stopped earlier due to the reduction of the number of covid-19 cases in china and it was therefore underpowered to provide conclusive information we report our experience of remdesivir compassionate use in 35 patients treated at luigi sacco hospital in milan italy between 23 february and 20 march 2020 of whom 63 completed the 10-day course and 37 discontinued it prematurely because of adverse events the hospitalisation status of 882 of our idw patients improved by the day 28 from starting remdesivir treatment the majority of whom had been discharged to resume their normal activities however there was a 444 case fatality rate among the patients who started the treatment in our icu given that the clinical condition of only one of our idw patients worsened it is possible that remdesivir may be more efficacious in patients who present early in a non-critical condition as has been shown in a previous study of the use of neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza 30 a delay in beginning antiviral treatment can be crucial when evaluating the efficacy of drugs against an acute respiratory infection interestingly we were able to measure sars-cov-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs of 21 of our patients at baseline and during remdesivir treatment and the rt-pcr showed that all of these patients became negative a median of 12 days after the start of treatment this is in line with with the rapid decline in viral load observed in a single patient treated with remdesivir in the usa 17 and these may cautiously considered a positive virological response given that a study conducted in wuhan showed that the median duration of viral shedding among patients surviving sars-cov-2 infection was 20 days 9 one-third of the patients enrolled in our study were unable to complete the scheduled 10-day course of remdesivir because of aes the most frequent severe ae was increase in liver enzymes a finding in line with data of the multicenter compassionate study by grein et al 28 moreover four of our patients who started remdesivir treatment in the icu developed aki and three of them eventually died however it is difficult to say whether the aki was caused by the infection itself remdesivir or any of the other administered medications since lpvr was discontinued 24 hour before the administration of remdesivir we believe that the aes were likely independent of that previous treatment although it cannot fully excluded we acknowledge that our study has a number of limitations first given the context in which it originated it was impossible to include a control group so we cannot exclude the possibility that the patients whose hospitalisation status improved after remdesivir treatment may have improved regardless of any treatment secondly most of our patients had previously received lpvr  hqc and this may represent a confounding factor when analysing the efficacy of remdesivir finally we could not predefine a virological follow-up which limits our finding of a possible virological effect of remdesivir in inducing the clearance of viral rna in the patients respiratory samples in conclusion remdesivir treatment may have a beneficial effect on sars cov-2 pneumonia especially in the case of non-critically ill patients our decision to administer it for compassionate use was triggered by a state of emergency but randomised controlled trials are now needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and any other investigational agent in the treatment of patients with sars cov-2 infection sa received support for research activities from 1013039100004319pfizer msd and boehringer ingelheim sr received grants

8 subsequently patients suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome for about 710 days after the onset of covid-19 due to rapid viral replication a stormy increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokine response and inflammatory cell infiltrates8

9 nevertheless contrary to the sars cases in 200310 some sars-cov-2 infection patients did not have the prodromal symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection eg cough sore throat rhinorrhea viremia-associated laboratory abnormalities eg leukopenia lymphopenia anemia elevation of liver enzymes and lactic dehydrogenase or initial evidence of diagnostic chest roentgenographic abnormalities6

11 in addition uncertain seasonality and the incubation period of sars-cov-2 infection oscillating between 2 and 14 days make it remarkably difficult to achieve early diagnosis and initiate treatment on time5

9 previous studies demonstrated that human coronavirus-nl63 hcov-nl63 is able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 as a cell receptor in humans5

12 although children are considered to be significantly less susceptible to hcov-nl63 infection and have milder disease severity than adults1

13 the sars-cov-2 infection has become a public health menace to people around the world presently because of high transmission potential and unpredictability of disease progression14 in order to contain sars-cov-2 spread among community residents stringent infection control measures were implemented by the centers for disease control cdc and prevention of taiwan since february 2020 according to an investigation by to et al 202015 patients with sars-cov infection had the highest viral load measured from posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples close to when they presented to et al concluded that since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admissions early use of potent antiviral agents might be beneficial in controlling covid-19 severity15 however standard treatment against covid-19 is presently lacking herein the roles of several drugs including antiviral agents some antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents have been reviewed to explore their efficacy in combating the sars-cov-2 data until march 28 2020 among several potential drugs tested for efficacy in treatment of sars-cov-2 infection16 remdesivir gs-5734 gilead sciences inc foster city ca usa is shown to be the most promising and hopeful anti-viral therapeutic it works by targeting viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp while evading proofreading by viral exoribonuclease17 resulting in premature termination of viral rna transcription unlike other nucleotide analogues remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug with broad-spectrum activity against many virus families including filoviridae paramyxoviridae pneumoviridae and orthocoronavirinae such as pathogenic sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov18

 information regarding the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in humans is not available nevertheless valuable data from rhesus monkeys revealed an intravenous 10 mgkg dose of remdesivir could lead to a remarkably high intracellular concentration 10 m of active triphosphate form in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for at least 24 h20 supporting its clinical potential in the treatment of human sars-cov-2 infection additionally data on the safety of remdesivir in humans are available online21 the first covid-19 patient in the usa was successfully treated with remdesivir for the progression of pneumonia on day 7 of hospitalization in january 20204 phase 3 human trials clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04292899 and nct04292730 for severe and moderate adult sars-cov-2 cases respectively have been initiated to evaluate its efficacy in patients with sars-cov-2 infection since march 2020 patients received 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily from day 2 despite its encouragingly high in vitro potency against sars-cov-2 and the clinical success in treatment of covid-194

18 uncertainties about adverse effects eg nausea vomiting rectal hemorrhage and hepatic toxicity and clinical efficacy of remdesivir have been reported recently22
 in a mouse model investigating the pathogenesis of sars-cov prophylactic and early therapeutic post-exposure administration of remdesivir were shown to produce a significant reduction in pulmonary viral load ie 2 orders of magnitude on day 25 post-infection mitigate disease progression and prominently improve respiration function18 furthermore brown et al observed that remdesivir displayed half-maximum effective concentrations ec50s of 0069 m for sars-cov and 0074 m for mers-cov in tissue culture models23 in addition tissue culture experiments also revealed that many highly divergent cov including the endemic human covs hcov-oc43 hcov-229e and zoonotic cov are effectively inhibited by remdesivir within the submicromolar ec50s23

24 of note the similar efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment 24 h prior to inoculation and 12 h post-inoculation respectively was also seen in the context of a non-human primate rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection25 although two amino acid substitutions f476l v553l in the non-structural protein 12 polymerase were demonstrated to confer low-level resistance to remdesivir this resistance also impaired the fitness of the tested covs and is actually difficult to select17
 the other rdrp inhibitor favipiravir fujifilm toyama chemical co ltd tokyo japan is known to be active in vitro against oseltamivir-resistant influenza a b and c viruses26 after being converted into an active phosphoribosylated form favipiravir is easily recognized as a substrate of viral rna polymerase in many rna viruses27 the recommended dose of favipiravir against influenza virus is 1600 mg administered orally twice daily on day 1 then 600 mg orally twice daily on day 25 and 600 mg once on day 6 recently preliminary results of clinical studies have shown favipiravir to have promising potency in treatment of chinese patients with sars-cov-2 infection28 favipiravir was approved for the treatment of covid-19 in china in march 2020 in addition patients with covid-19 infection are being recruited for randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon- chictr2000029600 and favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil chictr2000029544 ribavirin bausch health companies inc bridgewater nj usa is a guanosine analogue antiviral drug that has been used to treat several viral infections including hepatitis c virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and some viral hemorrhagic fevers the in vitro antiviral activity of ribavirin against sars-cov was estimated to be at a concentration of 50 gml29 however it has the undesirable adverse effect of reducing hemoglobin which is harmful for patients in respiratory distress19
 treatment with interferon  ifnb-1b bayer pharmaceutical co leverkusen germany an immunomodulatory agent was shown to result in clinical improvement among mers-cov-infected common marmosets but the benefits of ifnb-1b for sars patients remains uncertain29

 protease inhibitors pis are important agents in the contemporary treatment of patients with chronic human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection in the orthocoronavirinae family the targets of pis are papain-like protease and 3c-like protease30 the antiviral activity of lopinavir lpv abbott laboratories lake bluff illinois us against mers-cov in a tissue culture model is controversial despite a good effect in mitigating disease progression in mers-cov-infected marmosets29 of note sheahan et al 2020 compared the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir 25 mgkg twice a day administered 1 day prior to infection as well as therapeutic remdesivir with that of lpvritonavir rtv used to prolong the lpvs half-life-ifnb combination therapy in a humanized transgenic mouse mers-cov infection model they observed the efficacy of remdesivir was superior to that of lpvrtv-ifnb against mers-cov in terms of viral load reduction and improvement in extent of pathologic change in lung tissue31 in addition to gastrointestinal adverse effects nausea vomiting and diarrhea induced by lpvrtv it is noteworthy that lpvrtv treatment alone 400100 mg administered orally twice daily for 14 days chinese clinical trial register number chictr2000029308 failed to provide benefits compared to standard care alone median time to clinical improvement in both cases was 16 days hazard ratio hr 131 95 confidence interval ci 095 to 185 p  009 and there was no difference in the reduction of viral rna loading for severe sars-cov-2 patients32
 despite discouraging results it is intriguing that a slightly lower number of deaths was observed in the group receiving lpvrtv in the late stage of sars-cov-2 infection compared with the standard-care group moreover baden and ruben 2020 and sheahan et al 2020 suggested that the lpvrtv concentration necessary to inhibit pulmonary sars-cov-2 replication might be higher than the serum level31

33 a randomized controlled open-label trial was launched in china to evaluate the efficacy of lpvrtv 20050 mg twice a day among hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 infections in 2020 chictr2000029308 the role of darunavir janssen pharmaceutica beerse belgium also a promising pi against sars-cov-2 in vitro needs to be further evaluated34 ribavirin in combination with interferon- 2b was shown to be active against mers-cov in a rhesus macaque model35 additionally the regimen of lpvrtv plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against sars-cov in patients and in tissue culture36
 chloroquine is active against malaria as well as autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ra lupus erythematosus it was recently reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug for treatment of viruses such as influenza h5n1 in an animal model37 chloroquine was shown to increase endosomal ph which prevents viruscell fusion it also interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov38

39 although the in vitro data of chloroquine is promising ec90 of 690 m using vero e6 cells infected by sars-cov-2 an extensive prescription of chloroquine in clinical treatment of sars-cov-2 is a completely off-label use it is not recommended in light of safety concerns adverse effects on the hematologic hepatic and renal systems qtc prolongation with ventricular dysrhythmia and will likely result in a major shortage of anti-malarial armamentaria40
 hydroxychloroquine is also proposed to control the cytokine storm that occurs in critically ill late phase sars-cov-2 infected patients41 hydroxychloroquine is significantly more potent than chloroquine in vitro ec50 values 072 and 547 m respectively and has lower potential for drugdrug interactions than chloroquine pharmacokinetic models demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine sulfate is significant superior 5 days in advance to chloroquine phosphate in inhibiting sars-cov-2 in vitro41 the taiwan cdc declared hydroxychloroquine as an important anti-sars-cov-2 agent on 26 march 2020 of note patients with retinopathy deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase qtc prolongation in electrocardiograms history of allergy to hydroxychloroquine or who are pregnant or breastfeeding are contraindicated for receiving hydroxychloroquine therapy42
 azithromycin pfizer inc manhattan new york city ny usa was shown to be active in vitro against ebola viruses43 furthermore azithromycin is thought to have good potential in preventing severe respiratory tract infections among pre-school children when it is administrated to patients suffering viral infection44 according to one recent study azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day on day 25 was shown to significantly reinforce the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times per day for 10 days in the treatment of 20 patients with severe covid-19 mean serum hydroxychloroquine concentration was 046  020 gml the good clinical outcome among these covid-19 patients was thought to be due to the excellent efficiency of virus elimination after administration of this combination therapy42 consequently the regimen of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin might be a promising alternative to remdesivir in the treatment of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in the future nevertheless the possibility of complicated qtc prolongation should be concerned the other antibiotics worth mentioning in this review are glycopeptides teicoplanin sanofi pharmaceuticals paris france was demonstrated to potently prevent the entry of ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm and also has an inhibitory effect on transcription-as well as replication-competent virus-like particles in the low micromolar range ic50 330 nm45 moreover teicoplanin is able to block the mers and sars envelope pseudotyped viruses as well45 mechanistic investigations revealed that teicoplanin specifically inhibits the activities of host cells cathepsin l and cathepsin b which are responsible for cleaving the viral glycoprotein allowing exposure of the receptor-binding domain of its core genome and subsequent release into the cytoplasm of host cells46

47 thus teicoplanin blocks ebola virus entry in the late endosomal pathway these studies indicate the potential role of teicoplanin and its derivatives dalbavancin oritavancin and telavancin as novel inhibitors of cathepsin l-dependent viruses a brief summary of the mechanism of action and targets of potential antimicrobial agents against sars-cov-2 is shown in table 1
 monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies have been suggested as prophylactic and therapeutic tools targeting hemagglutinin binding against some viral infections such as influenza48 current efforts in developing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against coronaviruses mainly target mers-cov18 for example a human polyclonal antibody sab-301 50 mgkg that was generated in transchromosomic cattle was observed to be well tolerated and safe in healthy participants of a phase 1 clinical trial49 however cockrell et al 2016 observed that immune-based therapy with human monoclonal antibodies only provided protection against early stage disease caused by mers-cov in mouse models19

50
 numerous in vitro studies have shown that the spike protein of sars-cov is important in mediating viral entry into target cells furthermore the cleavage and subsequent activation of the sars-cov spike protein by a protease of the host cell is absolutely essential for infectious viral entry51 type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 was suggested to be an important host protease that cleaves and activates the sars-cov spike protein in cell cultures and was thus explored as a potential antiviral agent18 in the past decade the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate was shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of tmprss252 additionally the cysteine pi k11777 showed promising potency in inhibiting mers-cov and sars-cov replication within the submicromolar range53
 use of stem cells against covid-19 has been under evaluation in china recently additionally tocilizumab roche pharmaceuticals basel switzerland is a monoclonal antibody that is used in the treatment of ra exacerbation it was designed to inhibit the binding of interleukin-6 to its receptors thus alleviating cytokine release syndrome currently it is also being investigated for treatment of covid-1954
 convalescent plasma has also been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with various viral infections such as sars h5n1 avian influenza pandemic 2009 influenza a h1n1 h1n1 pdm09 and severe ebola virus infection55

56 one possible explanation for the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy is that the immunoglobulin antibodies in the plasma of patients recovering from viral infection might suppress viremia shen et al 2020 reported on five critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards who received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a sars-cov-2specific antibody binding titer 11000 and neutralization titer 40 the convalescent plasma was obtained from 5 patients who recovered from covid-19 and it was administered to the five enrolled patients between 10 and 22 days after admission antiviral agents and methylprednisolone were also administered following plasma transfusions improvements in clinical condition were observed including normalization of body temperature within 3 days in 45 patients decrease in sequential organ failure assessment score rise in pao2fio2 resolution of ards 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion a success of weaning from mechanical ventilation 3 patients within 2 weeks of treatment and decline in viral loads became negative within 12 days and increase in sars-cov-2specific elisa and neutralizing antibody titers of the 5 patients 3 were discharged from the hospital lengths of stay 53 51 and 55 days while 2 were in stable condition at 37 days after transfusions56 the authors concluded that use of convalescent plasma transfusion is beneficial among patients infected with sars-cov-2 even though the sample number in this study is small56
 the prevalence of co-infection varied among covid-19 patients ranging from 0 to 50 among non-survivors reported co-pathogens included bacteria such as mycoplasma pneumoniae candida species and viruses influenza rhinovirus coronavirus and hiv influenza a virus was the commonest co-infective virus59 co-administration of anti-influenza agents and anti-bacterial agents in patients with covid-19 pneumonia was common59 consequently a cautious prescription of effective antibiotics covering staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant s aureus multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as acinetobacter baumannii species for patients undergoing long hospitalization 6 days is advised60

61
 based on the research of yang et al 202062 the most distinctive comorbidities among the non-survivors of covid-19 in intensive care units were cerebrovascular disease and diabetes similar findings were also observed by guan et al 202063 these patients were usually treated with ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers arb as mentioned above5

12 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov can bind to their target cells through ace2 receptors expressed by the epithelial cells of lung intestine and kidney64 consequently careful administration of an ace inhibitor or arb for patients with sars-cov infection in the absence of ards is advised additionally despite conflicting advice from the us food and drug administration65 the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen was thought to be likely to result in an induction of increased ace2 receptors66 for critically ill adults with covid-19 who develop fever acetaminophen might be a better choice for temperature control than nsaids67 of note according to a study by wu et al 2020 treatment of covid-19 patients with methylprednisolone was shown to decrease the case-fatality risk hr 038 95 ci 02007268 however the administered dose of methylprednisolone is not specified in that investigation despite a lack of supporting evidence some critical care experts advocate the use of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in adults with covid-19 and refractory shock eg intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg per day as a shock-reversal strategy68
 moreover a recent report by tang et al 2020 demonstrated that anticoagulant therapy with heparin mainly with low molecular weight heparin was associated with better prognosis in severe covid-19 patients the 28-day mortality of heparin users was lower than that of non-users among patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy scores 4 400 vs 642 p  0029 or d-dimer  6-fold the upper limit of normal 328 vs 524 p  001769
 finally high ace2 activity is associated with reduced severity of ards among patients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv70 fedson et al 2016 2020 observed that statins target the host response to infection endothelial dysfunction rather than the virus itself and suggested that combination therapy with arb and statins might accelerate a return to homeostasis allowing patients to recover on their own71

 in summary we are facing a terrible virus with greater infectivity than the sars-cov pandemic of 2003 there is presently no vaccine or documented specific anti-sars-cov-2 drug regimen to treat critically ill patients most of the potential drugs for treatment of covid-19 are being investigated for safety and efficacy against sars-cov-2 remdesivir is the most promising agent in addition favipiravir and combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin appear to be acceptable alternatives for treatment of covid-19 patients for patients with sars-cov-2 infection ace inhibitor and arb need to be prescribed with caution compared with nsaids acetaminophen might be a safer agent for treating fever in covid-19 patients finally low-dose steroid hydrocortisone might be

treatment victoria yan c florian muller l   remdesivir is a structural analogue of adenosine monophosphate amp that interferes with
the sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp7 the anionic
phosphate moiety on remdesivir is masked by mcguigan prodrug moieties8
phenol and l-alaninate ethylbutyl ester to enhance cell permeability in
principle these prodrug moieties would be removed intracellularlyfirst by
esterases cathepsin acarboxylesterase 1 and then by phosphoramidases hint1-39 to release the monophosphorylated nucleotide this would then be
phosphorylated twice to give the active ntp79 figure 1a
which is substrate-competitive with atp for incorporation by viral rdrp and inhibition of
viral rna synthesis7 the mcguigan phosphate prodrug was partly
developed to overcome the perceived rate-limiting first phosphorylation step toward the
active triphosphorylated species bioactivation of the prodrug first involves
carboxylesterases ces1 and cathepsin a ctsa followed by phosphoramidases histidine
triad nucleotide binding proteins hints figure 1a911 protein expression data
from the human protein atlas show that these enzymes ces1 ctsa hint1 2 3 all have
high expression in the liver with minimal expression in type ii pneumocytes in the
lung12 figure 2 for the
hint family of phosphoramidases there is some slight variation in each isoforms
tissue-specific expression figure 2b c
however all 3 isoforms show high expression in the gi tract liver and kidneys from the
pattern of bioactivation for mcguigan prodrugs it follows that the most significant
accumulation active ntp will be in cell types with high expression of ces1ctsahint1-3
such as the liver preferential bioactivation of mcguigan prodrugs such as remdesivir
could explain the grade 34 adverse events related to liver and kidney damage in covid-19
patients treated with remdesivir13 seeing that the enzymes involved in
mcguigan prodrug hydrolysis are hardly expressed in the lungs undermines its utility in
the context of a primarily respiratory disease such as covid-19 hydrolytic enzymes are ubiquitous in serum14 this is one
physiological factor that especially for prodrugs15 prevents direct
extrapolation of bioactivation mechanisms observed in vitro to the
in vivo setting for example esterases and phosphatases are abundantly
present in serum across species1617 premature serum hydrolysis of the mcguigan prodrug on remdesivir is
thus unsurprising figure 1b multiple studies
have demonstrated that the nucleoside gs-441524 is the predominant species in serum
after remdesivir is administered figure 3b
c46 all studies that have
investigated the pk of remdesivir in nonhuman primates nhp have concluded that intact
remdesivir exhibits a short plasma half-life of about 04 h in serum with
persistence of the downstream nucleoside gs-441524 figure 3c46 iv injection of remdesivir in nhp results in gs-441524
being present in serum at concentrations 1000-fold higher than remdesivir throughout a
7-day treatment course6 figure 3b this recurring phenomenon can first be explained by the abundance of plasma
esterases as the phosphoramidases hint1 involved in removal of the l-alanine
have a strictly intracellular presence see human protein atlas hint1 inadvertent
biotransformation of remdesivir to gs-441524 can be explained by the following sequence
1 esterase removal of the l-alaninate ester 2 intramolecular cyclization
displacement of the phenolate followed by reopening of the ring 3 cleavage of the
phosphate ester by serum phosphatases or nucleosidases figure 1b the proposed serum bioactivation mechanism accounts for the
general substrate constraints for each class of enzyme for instance ces1 is named as one
of the enzymes involved in mcguigan prodrug hydrolysis however this does not preclude
other esterases from acting on its l-alaninate ester a study conducted by
sheahan and colleagues specifically investigated the pk of remdesivir in carboxylesterase
1c deficient mice
ces1c5 even in this ces1c model
the half-life of remdesivir was still short t12  25
min supporting the notion that other esterases are capable of performing the initial
hydrolysis reaction thus the abundance of hydrolytic enzymes in serum explains the
persistent multispecies observation that gs-441524 is the predominant metabolite when
remdesivir is administered46 for the fleeting duration
of time that remdesivir is in the blood prior to hydrolysis to
gs-441524 the expression of bioactivating enzymes for mcguigan prodrugs suggests that
the highest concentrations of ntp formation by remdesivirrather than
gs-441524would occur in cell types with high expression of ces1ctsahint1 this
largely favors the liver over the lungs figure 2 differential expression of prodrug bioactivating enzymes likely explains the
wide range of ec50 values with remdesivir in
vitro1820 there are currently no studies that have compared the antiviral activities of remdesivir
and gs-441524 in vivo with most focusing exclusively on remdesivir
where gs-441524 has been investigated in vivo is in the veterinary
setting2123 cats infected with
feline coronavirus fcov present with a serious disease known as feline infectious
peritonitis fip while long considered fatal in its severe manifestations24 a study conducted by pedersen and colleagues showed that gs-441524 is
capable of treating cats suffering from fip with a 96 cure rate21
pedersen noted the impressive safety profile of gs-441524 with no
systemic signs of toxicity observed when administered subcutaneously at 4 mgkg21 in a more recent study pedersen and colleagues escalated the dose of
gs-441524 510 mgkg to treat neurological manifestations of fip this translates
to about 350700 mg in a 70 kg human greatly exceeding the dose currently given to
patients treated with remdesivir 200 mg loading then 100 mg1325 even at these higher doses they
found that gs-441524 treatment resulted in the long term resolution of neurological fip
with an excellent safety profile minimal dose-related toxicities were observed23 in vitro potency comparisons between gs-441524 and remdesivir are
ultimately moot in the context of respiratory diseases such as sars-cov-2 if gs-441524 is
the predominant species that reaches the lungs to better gauge the efficacy of gs-441524
against sars-cov-2 it is helpful to first compare ec50 values between
coronavirus infected human and cat cells as the clinical efficacy of gs-441524 has
already been well-established in cats21 gs-441524 has an
ec50 value of 078 m in crfk cells infected with fcov figure 3a26 at the time of
publication a study by agostini and colleagues is the only report that has compared the
antiviral activities of gs-441524 and remdesivir in primary human airway epithelial hae
cells the most clinically relevant in vitro model of the lung infected
with either sars-cov or mers-cov27 while the mean ec50
value of remdesivir is lower for both sars-cov and mers-cov-infected cells close
inspection of the data reveals large standard deviations between the ec50
values obtained from gs-441524 and remdesivir making these potency differences not
statistically significant figure 3a27 for instance against sars-cov-infected hae cells gs-441524 has a
reported ec50 of 018 014 m which is comparable if not lower
than that required to exert antiviral activity against fcov-infected cells in
vitro most significantly the ec50 concentration for gs-441524
against sars-cov-infected primary hae cells is sustained in the plasma of nhp for nearly
the entire duration of the single-dose 24 h pk experiment conducted by warren and
colleagues figure 3c in contrast the
ec50 concentration for remdesivir against sars-cov-infected primary hae cells
diminishes after 2 h the dominance of gs-441524 over remdesivir in serum was even
more pronounced in williamsons 7-day pk study in which gs-441524 was present in
serum at concentrations 1000-fold greater than remdesivir at every measured time point
figure 3b6 coupled with
the robust antiviral activity that gs-441524 has demonstrated against fip these data
compel further investigations into the therapeutic and prophylactic utility of gs-441524
against sars-cov-2 in patients sars-cov-2 is a respiratory virus that primarily affects the lungs12
while remdesivir has shown some efficacy in patients with advanced covid-1913 its phosphate prodrug is fundamentally not designed for lung-specific
delivery enzymes that activate the mcguigan prodrug are preferentially expressed in tissues
such as the liver which results in uneven distribution of active ntp formation via
remdesivir that disfavors the lungs practically the structural complexity of the mcguigan
prodrug28 adds unnecessary synthetic difficulty that hampers mass
production and impedes distribution1 above all else premature
hydrolysis of the mcguigan prodrug followed by dephosphorylation in serum such that
gs-441524 is the predominant metabolite4529 compels studies investigating its utility in
patients with covid-19 in contrast to the prodrug activating enzymes that activate
remdesivir bioactivation of gs-441524 relies on expression of the kinase responsible for
initial phosphorylation likely adenosine kinase adk according to the human protein
atlas adk is moderately expressed across all tissues suggesting that administration of
gs-441524 would result in even distribution across tissues the remarkable safety profile of
gs-441524 indicated by selectivity indices in vitro
ec50cc50 ratio21930 and by clinical observations in
cats2123 suggest that higher dosing
and lung ntp loading could be achieved with gs-441524 without encountering serious adverse
effects gs-441524 is also a structurally simple molecule that is easier to synthesize
compared to remdesivir2 which would ease mass production and
distribution especially amidst the documented premature serum hydrolysis of remdesivir to
gs-4415244529 we see several advantages to using gs-441524 over remdesivir for
patients with covid-19 while gs-441524 is not included in the emergency use authorization
of remdesivir the exigence of the pandemic may allow ordinary regulatory hurdles to be
overcome especially as these two drugs yield the same active species an investigational
new drug ind waiver or an emergency ind could be filed the fda has previously made
allowances for prodrugs and their corresponding active substances as in the case of
lenflunomideteriflunomide further investigations into the anti-covid-19 utility of
gs-441524 are thus imperative  delayed initiation of remdesivir in a covid19positive patient emily hillaker julie belfer j anamaria bondici hani murad lisa dumkow e   a 40yearoldman presented to his ambulatory provider for a covid19 screening with a 2day history of dry cough shortness of breath and subjective fever in accordance with cdc recommendations and state and local health officials the patient was considered low risk and did not meet criteria to be a person under investigation or for covid19 testing at that time on day 3 of illness he had a telemedicine covid19 screening due to worsening symptoms and newonset vomiting at this time he was advised to report to a designated covid19 testing center there he was tested for covid19 via nasopharyngeal swab with a realtime reversetranscriptasepolymerase chain reaction rrtpcr assay advanced technology laboratories he was advised to quarantine for 14 days and await test results during this visit both a rapid streptococcus

found to be clear to auscultation respirations were nonlabored and chest radiography was performed that reported areas of faint hazy opacity in the lateral left midlung and the upper right lung field possibly related to atelectasis or infiltrate figure 1 after improvement following supportive care he was discharged with a diagnosis of likely covid19 and was advised to return to the ed if he had worsening symptoms later that same day the patient returned physical examination revealed body temperature of 385c blood pressure of 13574 mm hg pulse of 122 beats per minute respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 87 on room air the remainder of the examination was unremarkable influenza ab pcr cepheid was negative at this time the patient was admitted to the hospital for suspected covid19 and further observation by day 6 of illness hospital day 2 he was requiring 6 l of oxygen by nasal cannula with increased shortness of breath and tachypnea with his respiratory rate 2528 breaths per minute he was placed on 15 l of oxygen by nonrebreather mask with improvement to oxygen saturation of 95 the intensive care team was alerted and advised to switch the patient back to 6 l of oxygen by nasal cannula nonrebreather to prevent further viral aerosolization an hour later he was urgently intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit a chest radiograph revealed diffuse patchy infiltrate bilaterally a chest computed tomography without contrast revealed extensive ground glassmosaic attenuation and consolidation opacification throughout bilateral lung

additionally cefepime 2 g intravenously iv every 8 hours and azithromycin 500 mg iv every 24 hours were recommended for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia a sputum culture was ordered as well as legionella urine antigen testing later that evening his covid19 test was confirmed as positive because of his acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and likely progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the use of investigational remdesivir was discussed among the id team clinical pharmacist and the patients family following signed consent by the patients family for treatment the id physician contacted gilead via email to initiate the individual compassionate use process and approval was received early the following morning figures 3 and 4 on day 7 of illness hospital day 3 the patients oxygen requirements increased to an fio2 of 70 and a peep of 14 cm h2o furosemide as needed was initiated to maintain an even or slightly negative fluid

for an emergency investigational new drug eind the institutions investigational review board was also notified for approval the id physician and clinical pharmacist were granted access to the medidata system to input the patients baseline testing and laboratory data later in the day the eind was received from the fda approving the use of remdesivir on day 8 of illness hospital day 4 ards treatment was initiated with prone positioning neuromuscular blockade and aggressive diuresis to achieve a fluid negative balance with maximum ventilator support achieved there was a discussion about extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo with a nearby hospital with capabilities later that afternoon however he tolerated a downward titration to fio2 of 35 with peep 16 cm h2o and methylprednisolone 100 mg ivday was added the fda eind fda form 3926 patient consent form and prescriber curriculum vitae and medical license information were emailed to gilead following the receipt of these documents the final steps in the process were awaiting the manufacturer to send a formal prescriber agreement for signature shipping instructions as well as the medication administration and handling instructions during the next 48 hours mechanical ventilator settings were stable although unable to be weaned down significantly he had been afebrile for 24 hours and sputum culture was reported complete with normal respiratory flora therefore the cefepime and azithromycin were discontinued hydroxychloroquine was also discontinued due to upward trending alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast at this time the id team was still awaiting the prescriber agreement paperwork and shipping instructions from gilead that were delayed due to drug supply issues and cessation of the compassionate use program on day 11 of illness hospital day 7 the id physician received the prescriber agreement from gilead this was returned via email and a letter of authorization was then sent from gilead to the fda to accompany the patientspecific eind additionally reference materials including the investigator brochure template protocol and pharmacy manual were received from the manufacturer throughout this period the patient continued to require aggressive mechanical ventilator support the id pharmacist was contacted by gilead with shipping instructions indicating medication delivery would occur within 24 hours at this time the medication and administration and handling instructions were built in the electronic medical record system to expedite drug compounding and delivery once the product arrived on day 13 of illness hospital day 9 remdesivir arrived and a 200 mg iv loading dose was administered to the patient this was followed by orders for a remdesivir 100 mg iv maintenance dose every 24 hours for the next 9 days during the following 48 hours the patient continued to progress he was able to tolerate aggressive mechanical ventilation weaning and his alt and ast were downtrending on day 16 of illness hospital day 12 he was extubated without incident his oxygen saturations remained stable requiring 23 l of oxygen by nasal cannula and were able to maintain his oxygenation saturation on room air by day 17 of illness hospital day 13 the patient continues to be in stable condition on room air and is progressing toward discharge remdesivir also known as gs5734 is a novel antiviral nucleotide prodrug created by gilead sciences for the treatment of the ebola virus outbreak in 2016

 although it did not demonstrate efficacy in human clinical trials for this disease it has shown efficacy against coronaviruses including sarscov1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus

12
 
13
 because of this remdesivir has garnered significant attention for its potential use as a treatment option for sarscov2 as an adenosine analog remdesivir was shown to incorporate into growing viral rna chains resulting in premature termination and a decrease in viral rna production
4
 due to a 96 structural similarity in its rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp compared with the virus causing sarscov1 remdesivir which targets the viral rdrp is postulated to be effective against sarscov2 as well
13
 previous literature showed significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function following remdesivir administration
11
 its favorable safety profile demonstrated in multiple case reports randomized trials of ebola virus disease as well as currently ongoing phase 3 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trials in china further expand interest in this potentially lifesaving drug

 unfortunately the process to obtain remdesivir for compassionate use is both challenging and time consuming although the manufacturer cautions prescribers that the process to obtain the medication typically takes a minimum of 72 hours for our patient this process took more than double the estimated time expected this delay in obtaining medication is concerning because other antivirals such as oseltamivir for influenza or acyclovir for herpes viruses are effective only if given within a small window of time after symptom onset
7
 
14
 
15
 additionally many patients hospitalized with sarscov2 may have already been symptomatic for several days selfisolating while awaiting test results or until symptoms have worsened before presenting to the hospital further delaying time to therapy fortunately our patient made significant improvement in oxygenation and was able to be extubated less than 72 hours after starting remdesivir despite this delay in therapy thus administration of remdesivir regardless of time from symptom onset may still have clinical benefits for patients with sarscov2 another report detailing the first case of communitytransmitted sarscov2 in the united states demonstrated similar complications of delayed diagnosis and treatment with remdesivir was recently published similar to our case the authors observed clinical improvement after treatment with remdesivir initiated on day 11 of illness
16

 the rapid increase in critically ill covid19 cases reported across the country and subsequent demand for remdesivir has resulted in a supply shortage with the manufacturer halting the individual compassionate use process outside of patients who are pregnant or pediatric with severe disease manifestations at this time gilead is moving toward an expanded access program for future institutional use of remdesivir outside of clinical trials however details of that program are still forthcoming and the procedure is expected to be similarly cumbersome as the previous individual compassionate use process enrollment in ongoing clinical trials to obtain remdesivir may also be difficult for institutions especially community hospitals with less investigational research support this case highlights significant issues that must be addressed as a health care and regulatory system in the united states as the covid19 global pandemic continues to spread it is critical that access to potentially lifesaving treatments be quickly available to patients the fda and government regulatory agencies must be called on to take urgent action to work with drug manufacturers of promising investigational therapies to ensure adequate supply and rapidly evaluate safety and efficacy data changes to improve and accelerate the processes of drug manufacturing fda evaluation and approval during times of pandemic are paramount to expedite access to treatment for critically ill patients this report has limitations that must be considered our perspective comes from a single patient treated with remdesivir late in the course of disease this patient also received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for 5 days and although he did not initially show clinical improvement after the duration of these therapies this combination is also being investigated as potential therapy for sarscov2
17
 it is possible these medications may have impacted his clinical course he is also a younger patient with few comorbidities his most significant risk factor for mortality was obesity because the mortality rate in his demographic in the united states is less than 1 it is possible that he would have improved without remdesivir
17
 
18
 further study and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir are required to confirm its efficacy against covid19 including if efficacy differences exist between early and delayed administration late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating sarscov2 unlike antivirals such as oseltamivir and acyclovir which are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset this case highlights the urgent need for action by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting sarscov2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands  remdesivir lopinavir emetine and homoharringtonine inhibit sars-cov-2 replication in vitro ka-tim choy alvina wong yin-lam prathanporn kaewpreedee

1999 to reduce the effective concentration of individual compound below the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration we explored the combinational effect of remdesivir and emetine in vitro drug interaction was evaluated using the checkerboard assay with serially 2-fold diluted remdesivir 050 m and emetine 00781 m in combination remdesivir at 625 m in combination with emetine at 0195 m may achieve 649 inhibition of viral yield which can be further tested in vivo fig 2
a the loewe additive model and the bliss independent model malyutina et al 2019 were used to analyse the interaction of the two compounds using synergyfinder ianevski et al 2017 remdesivir and emetine in combination yielded a loewe synergy score of 0306 fig 2b and a bliss synergy score of 20234 fig 2c we confirm the antiviral activity of four compounds that have been reported to inhibit other coronavirus or sars-cov-2 replication in vitro our results suggest that combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration against sars-cov-2 under the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration there is an urgent research need to identify optimal dose combination of effective compounds against the sars-cov-2 virus for better clinical benefit  medical treatment options for covid-19 leen delang johan neyts   chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are anti-malaria drugs that have been widely used to treat malaria patients due to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant plasmodium parasites the use of chloroquine to treat malaria has been more restricted hydroxychloroquine is also administered to patients with auto-immune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered as safe drugs and the side effects are usually mild and transient however it is important to note that the window between therapeutic and toxic doses is narrow chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular symptoms and can be life-threatening self-treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is therefore not recommended the antiviral activity of chloroquine was already identified in the late 1960s5 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are able to inhibit a broad range of viruses from different virus families in cell culture including coronaviruses sars-cov-1 mers-cov67 recently in vitro antiviral efficacy against sars-cov-2 was also demonstrated8 for some viruses antiviral activity was observed in mouse models including for the human coronavirus oc439 and influenza a virus h5n110 however in a sars-cov-1 mouse model chloroquine was not able to reduce viral titres in the lungs11 in patients no evidence of antiviral activity has yet been observed during acute viral infections5 a number of clinical trials has been conducted in more than 10 hospitals in china to assess the efficacy of chloroquine to treat covid-19 patients in a recent publication12 it was stated that according to the news briefing results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course however no data from these clinical trials have yet been released to support this announcement making it impossible to draw firm conclusions in france 26 covid-19 patients were treated for 6 days with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times per day13 six of these patients also received azithromycin sixteen patients were used as the control group sars-cov-2 rna was measured in nasopharyngeal swabs daily during the treatment during the study six patients from the treated group had to be excluded and were not considered in data analysis three patients had to be transferred to intensive care units one left the hospital because the patient tested negative one stopped treatment due to side effects and one person died during the treatment the authors reported clearance in sars-cov-2 rna in the nasopharyngeal swabs in 57 of chloroquine-treated patients compared to 125 of untreated patients at day 6 post-inclusion in the study in addition a synergistic effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was suggested because all patients treated with this combination cleared viral rna by day 6 post-inclusion however as not all patients entered the study at the same stage of the disease it is difficult to assess whether the clearance in viral rna was due to the treatment or due to the immune system of the patient furthermore the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin is associated with severe qt prolongation and should thus be considered with care before chloroquine can be considered safe and effective as a treatment for covid-19 more studies are needed remdesivir gs-5734 is an experimental drug that was under development for the treatment of ebola virus-infected patients14 remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that inhibits viral rna replication the prodrug needs to be activated in the cell into a nucleoside triphosphate which then serves as an alternative substrate for the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase the incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate in the growing viral rna chain will result in chain termination and therefore halt viral rna replication despite potent efficacy in ebola virus animal models remdesivir was less efficacious in a clinical trial conducted in the democratic republic of congo15 in cell culture remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several other rna viruses including arenaviruses14 and coronaviruses16 it was previously shown that remdesivir can efficiently inhibit sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in cell culture including in human airway epithelial cells16 remdesivir also demonstrated antiviral activity against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in an animal model in the mers mouse model remdesivir reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology17 very recently it was shown that remdesivir is also active against sars-cov-2 in cells8 a case report described the use of remdesivir in one covid-19 patient18 this patient initially presented with mild symptoms including a cough and low-grade intermittent fevers without evidence of pneumonia however by illness day 9 the patient progressed to pneumonia as the clinical status of the patient worsened compassionate administration of remdesivir was pursued treatment with intravenous remdesivir was initiated on day 11 of illness on illness day 12 the clinical condition of the patient improved supplementation with exogenous oxygen was stopped although encouraging the apparent success of remdesivir treatment in this one patient does not prove that the drug is effective remdesivir is now being evaluated in covid-19 patients in five clinical studies worldwide two studies in china and studies in the united states singapore and south korea results of these trials are not available yet lopinavir is an hiv protease inhibitor that is usually combined with ritonavir to increase its half-life via cytochrome p450 inhibition whether hiv protease inhibitors might also inhibit the coronavirus protease remains a question because the hiv protease belongs to a different protease family from the two coronavirus proteases aspartic vs cysteine protease family respectively19 furthermore hiv protease inhibitors were specifically designed to fit in a certain pocket of the hiv protease dimer but this pocket is not present in coronavirus proteases antiviral activity of lpvr against sars-cov-1 was reported in cell culture20 but conflicting results were reported for mers-cov721 in common marmosets infected with mers-cov lpvr was able to improve the clinical outcome and reduce viral loads in the lungs22 however in a mers-cov mouse model the prophylactic use of lpvr in combination with interferon-beta only slightly reduced the viral loads in the lungs without impacting other disease parameters17 therapeutic treatment of lpvr with interferon-beta improved the pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology in sars-cov-1-infected patients results of the treatment with lpvr were inconclusive23 in addition two case reports describing mers patients receiving lpvr in combination with ribavirin and interferon-alpha reported conflicting results2425 the preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of lpvr in covid-19 patients is thus modest a case report from south-korea described the use of lpvr in a covid-19 patient with mild respiratory symptoms26 lpvr was started at day 10 of illness no clear inhibitory effect on viral rna was observed in the daily sputum samples in a randomised controlled open-label trial involving hospitalised adult patients with severe covid-19 99 patients were treated with lpvr while 100 patients received the standard care treatment27 no difference in the time to clinical improvement and in mortality was observed between both groups another molecule that is being evaluated in covid-19 patients in china is favipiravir favipiravir t-705 is an antiviral drug that has been approved in 2014 in japan to treat pandemic influenza virus infections it acts as a prodrug which is converted intracellularly into its ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate metabolite favipiravir-rtp28 interestingly this molecule is able to inhibit a broad range of other rna viruses29 the exact mode of action that underlies this broad-spectrum anti-rna virus activity has not been completely unravelled it is hypothesised that favipiravir-rtp could be misincorporated in a growing viral rna chain or that it could act by binding to conserved polymerase domains thus preventing viral rna replication incorporation of favipiravir-rtp in the nascent viral rna could result in lethal mutagenesis by ambiguous base-pairing or in chain termination favipiravir was evaluated in clinical trials for influenza virus infections mainly in japan in which the drug was well tolerated reported side effects were mild to moderate diarrhoea asymptomatic increase of transaminases and uncommonly decreased neutrophil counts importantly favipiravir is contraindicated in women who might be or are pregnant and in lactating women because of its association with embryonic deaths and teratogenicity in animal studies29 favipiravir has modest antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in cell culture ec50 value of 62 m8 activity against other coronaviruses in cells or animal models has not been reported despite the rather weak scientific base for the use of favipiravir as an anti-coronavirus drug clinical trials with favipiravir have been conducted in china in an open-label non-randomised controlled study 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 were treated with oral favipiravir day 1 1600 mg twice daily days 214 600 mg twice daily plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation 5 million u twice daily30 in the control group 45 patients were treated with lpvr days 114 400 mg100 mg twice daily plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation both treatments were continued until viral clearance was confirmed or until 14 days after the start of treatment the median time of viral clearance for the patients treated with favipiravir was 4 days which was significantly shorter than the time for patients in the control group with lpvr 11 days the report of this study does not clarify in which type of samples viral clearance was studied chest computed tomography scans improved in the favipiravir-treated group 914 vs 622 in the lpvr treated group in an open-label randomised study 116 covid-19 pneumonia patients received favipiravir in combination with conventional therapy whereas 120 patients received arbidol in combination with conventional therapy arbidol is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus infection that is approved in russia and china31 the primary outcome of this study was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 after start of treatment which was defined as recovery of fever respiratory rate oxygen saturation and cough relief for at least 72 hours a non-peer-reviewed report on this study describes that in covid-19 patients with mild symptoms fever and respiratory symptoms without difficulties in breathing the clinical recovery rate at day 7 was higher in the favipiravir-treated group when compared to the arbidol-treated group 714 vs 559 furthermore the time of cough relief and fever reduction by favipiravir was significantly shorter than that by arbidol however for covid-19 patients with hypertension andor diabetes the clinical recovery rate was not significantly different between both groups 548 vs 514 the same picture was observed for critically ill covid-19 patients these data suggest that favipiravir might be useful for patients with mild symptoms but not for severely ill patients tocilizumab actemra is a humanised interleukin-6 il-6 receptor antagonist that was approved to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis a non-peer reviewed report describes the results of a single-arm chinese trial in which 21 severe or critical covid-19 patients received tocilizumab33 on the first day after receiving tocilizumab the body temperature of all patients returned to normal conditions and remained stable for the next days in addition the need for supplemental oxygen decreased in 75 of the treated patients although promising the lack of a control group makes it difficult to interpret the true benefit of this therapy based on these results china updated its treatment guidelines and approved the use of tocilizumab to treat covid-19 patients with serious lung damage and high il-6 levels as published data that support the use of tocilizumab are currently limited properly designed randomised trials are essential to understand the true impact of this therapy in covid-19 two non-randomised clinical trials are currently ongoing in china evaluating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in larger groups of covid-19 patients furthermore a phase iii study covacta will enroll hospitalised adults with severe covid-19 pneumonia globally starting from april 2020 this study will be a randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial a us-based phase iiiii trial will evaluate the efficacy of sarilumab kevzara another il-6 receptor antagonist in adults hospitalised with serious complications from covid-19 in the double-blind phase ii trial the primary endpoint will be reduction of fever and the secondary endpoint the decreased need for supplemental oxygen granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf plays a critical role in the defence against viruses and maintaining a proper function of the immune system gm-csf might thus be one of the key cytokines involved in the overreacted inflammatory response observed in covid-19 pneumonia a yeast-derived version of gm-csf leukine sargramostim rhu-gm-csf has been approved for use in five clinical indications the safety profile of this drug is therefore well known the efficacy of leukine for the treatment of covid-19 patients with respiratory failure will be evaluated in a clinical study in belgium sarpac trial leukine will be administered in a nebulised form for direct inhalation or through intravenous administration for patients that are already on a respirator with hospitals being overwhelmed with severely ill patients treatment options for covid-19 are very much needed rapid identification of such therapies is thus essential but challenging repurposing of existing antiviral and immunomodulating drugs is an important strategy because the safety profile of these drugs is well known however the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 has emphasised once again the urgent need to develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs not only for coronaviruses but also for other virus families that may also be the cause of future epidemicspandemics several clinical trials with covid-19 patients are evaluating repurposed drugs but there is no uniformity in timing duration of treatment and study endpoints in the currently registered clinical trials the primary outcome was clinical in 66 of the studies virological in 23 radiological in 8 or immunological in 33 as the pathogenesis of covid-19 is not yet well understood and associations between clinical status and viral clearance radiological or immunological evaluations are unclear the use of clinical outcomes should be encouraged in the solidarity trial launched by the who only simple outcomes will be measured that are currently relevant for public health the day the patient left the hospital or died the duration of the hospital stay and whether the patient required oxygen or ventilation4 in this pandemic context it is essential that clinicians have rapid access to the information from clinical trials still it is important that clinical trials and the reports on their results are of high quality as these results will guide clinicians in their decision on which drug to use the dosing and duration of the treatment and which patients to include and exclude clinical trials should thus be designed with care because robust results are essential in addition transparent and complete reporting on these clinical trials is needed to allow independent assessment of the potential benefit for covid-19 patients furthermore the selection of therapies to be evaluated in clinical studies needs to be based on clear scientific in vitro and preclinical in vivo evidence we may expect that in the next few weeks carefully performed trials will be reported that will guide doctors around the world to give the best care both in terms of reducing viral replication and mitigating hyperinflammation to covid-19 patients  known drugs and small molecules in the battle for covid-19 treatment alexios panoutsopoulos a   the sars-cov-2 virus emerged in december 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide starting china japan and south korea and then to europe and north america while the world health organization on march 11th declared the rapidly spreading novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic acknowledging that the virus will likely spread to all countries on the globe  as of may 2nd 2020 more than 35 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and almost 250000 deaths have been reported whith one third of the cases and more than one fifth of the deaths to have occurred in the united states john hopkins coronavirus resource center statistics in response to the most serious global health threat in more than a century the worlds biomedical establishment has unleashed an unprecedented response to the covid-19 pandemic rapidly increasing resources aimed at finding safe and effective treatments for the disease comprehensively reviewed in zhai et al 2020  research for treatments has emerged from different medical backgrounds both pharmacologically with the use of well known drugs for other diseases elfiky 2020b elfiky  2020a sheahan et al 2020 gordon et al 2020 gao and hu 2020 or corticosteroids russell millar and baillie 2020 and immunologically from the serum antibodies of former patients against other coronaviruses or from patients that have recovered from covid-19 mulangu et al 2019 mair-jenkins et al 2015 duan et al 2020 or even with the use of revolutionary ideas such as the combination of cripr tool with cas13 chen yu and guo 2018 knott et al 2017 abbott et al 2020  another tremendous effort from nih clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04283461 and all countries around the globe focuses on the successful development of a vaccine that would prevent the emergence of covid-19 through the years and the creation of a repeating cycle of spreading like the influenza virus wrapp et al 2020 du et al 2009  in this review we are going to focus on small molecules and drugs that are already in use and fda approved for other diseases and show promising results for treatment of covid-19 all except nicotine as of may 2020 and are all under further investigation with large numbers of patients and some of them with randomised placebo controlled studies which is considered the golden standard in medicine for the use of a certain compound for a treatment in a novel disease coronavirus remdesivir pandemic chloroquine zinc ivermectin nicotine ace2 importin rna virus virology treatment drugs  in order to better understand the mechanisms through which these drugs are working it is vital to elucidate the basic steps through which the sars-cov2 virus is infecting a human cell more often alveolar epithelial type ii cells sungnak et al 2020  and how it replicates inside the human organism coronaviruses covs are the largest rna viruses identified so far and belong to the coronaviridae family they are divided into 4 groups - - and - while the -coronaviruses are further divided into a b c and d lineages sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are members of -coronaviruses lineage b  particularly sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have 898 sequence identity in their spike s protein s2 subunits mediate the membrane fusion process and both of their s1 subunits utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 as the receptor to infect human cells maier bickerton and britton 2015  most importantly the ace2-binding affinity of the of s protein of sars-cov-2 is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of sars-cov wrapp et al 2020  which contributes to the higher infectivity of sars-cov-2 as compared to sars-cov keep bickerton and britton 2015  after binding of the s protein on the virion to the ace2 receptor on the target cell the heptad repeat 1 hr1 and 2 hr2 domains in its s2 subunit of s protein interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle 6-hb fusion core kubo yamada and taguchi 1994  bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and infection bosch et al 2004  therefore the s-protein-receptor interaction is the primary determinant for a coronavirus to infect a host cell and also governs the tissue specificity of the virus the virus gains access to the host cell cytosol by aciddependent proteolytic cleavage of s protein by a cathepsin protease followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes s protein cleavage occurs at two sites within the s2 subunit of the protein belouzard chu and whittaker 2009  fusion occurs within acidified endosomes and the formation of the bundle after fusion allows for the mixing of viral and cellular membranes resulting in the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm bosch et al 2004  the next step in the coronavirus lifecycle is the translation of the most vital gene of the virus the rna-dependent rna polymerase or replicase gene from the virion genomic rna the replicase gene encodes two large orfs that produce two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab baranov et al 2005 brierley digard and inglis 1989  these can be expressed by overlapping reading frames through ribosomal frameshifting from the rep1a into the rep1b orf reading frame in vitro studies predict the incidence of ribosomal frameshifting is as high as 25  araki et al 2010  polyproteins of coronaviruses are furtherly cleaved by a group of proteases either two or three proteases that cleave the replicase polyproteins these are the papain-like proteases plpro and a serine type protease ziebuhr snijder and gorbalenya 2000 mielech et al 2014  many non-structural proteins nsps are assembling the replicase-transcriptase complex rtc to create an environment suitable for rna synthesis while specifically nsp12 encodes the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp domain this is the enzyme that will elongate new positive sense rna molecules from the original rna of the virion when conditions will allow this to happen snijder et al 2003  viral rna synthesis produces both genomic and sub-genomic rnas sgrnas sgrnas serve as mrnas for the structural and accessory genes of the virus in this stage coronaviruses are known for their ability to recombine using both homologous and nonhomologous recombination  this ability is considered to play a prominent role in viral evolution lai et al 1985  after replication and sgrna synthesis the viral structural proteins s e and m are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum er these proteins move to the the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic krijnse-locker et al 1994 tooze tooze and warren 1984 and are encapsulated by n protein buds into membranes of the ergic containing viral structural proteins forming mature virions de haan and rottier 2005  the m protein is the most abundant of the three and directs most protein-protein interactions required for assembly of coronaviruses while the e protein functions as a chaperone to the m protein ye and hogue 2007  lastly the s spike protein is incorporated into virions at this step by interacting with the m protein but is not required for assembly as already stated the trimeric s protein make up the distinctive spike structure on the surface of the virus beniac et al 2006 delmas and laude 1990 and acts as a class i fusion protein bosch et al 2004  that mediates attachment to the host receptor following assembly virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis collins et al 1982  there more than a dozen already known drugs or small molecules that are potentially able to help in tackling the novel coronavirus infectious process here we discuss five of the most promising compounds and describe how they are able to intervene in one of the many steps that sars-cov2 virus needs to do in order to be replicated successfully in a human cell zinc will shut down rna dependent rna polymerase or replicase the problem is how to get zinc inside the cell because zinc is a 2  ion and ions cannot get through the cellular membrane unless there is a transporter that allows it to come in this has been already tested in vitro with an ionophore which allows zinc to come into the cell so they could see that the activity of this rna dependent rna polymerase was reduced thus zinc inhibited coronavirus rna polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores blocked the replication of these viruses in cell culture when they looked at the sars virus te velthuis et al 2010 as the zinc concentration inside the cell went up the by-product of the rna dependent rna polymerase rd rp went down clearly demonstrating that zinc intracellularly is blocking this very important enzyme of the virus zinc supplements get absorbed into the body in the blood into the extracellular space and the problem is how to get that zinc from the extracellular space into the intracellular space in the cytosol where it needs to work on infected cells and the viral proteins again what is needed is some sort of ionophore or a gated mechanism to open and to allow that zinc to come into the cell thus increasing the concentration of zinc into the cell so it can block rd rp an irrelevant of sars infection research publication of 2014 has showed that zinc may help some cancer cells to be led to autophagocytosis in the lysosomes and that by giving chloroquine they could have these cancer cells disappear in a far more superior rate what they show is that they were able to detect much higher intracellular zinc by increasing concentrations of chloroquine in fact small amount of chloroquine at 10 micromolar will increase the intracellular concentration of zinc ten-fold xue et al 2014 chloroquine is a medication that has been around for decades end is used to treat malaria while it is pretty inexpensive to produce and widely available one does need a prescription to use it and it doesnt come without side effects mejia torres et al 2013  under the pressure of finding a treatment that could possibly ease the covid-19 implications in serious cases a chinese expert consensus published an article in february 2020 that states that chloroquine phosphate or chloroquine has a wide range of antiviral effects including anti-coronavirus effects and in patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia might improve the success rate of treatment and improve patient outcome in 500 milligrams twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild moderate and severe cases of coronavirus pneumoniamulticenter collaboration group of department of technology of guangdong and health commission of guangdong province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus 2020  surely further investigation needs to be done with this combination of drugs to prove or reject their relevance with blocking sars-cov2s infection process remdesivir developed by gilead sciences inc is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment it was previously tested in humans with ebola virus disease and so far it has shown promise in animal models for treating middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars remdesivir triphosphate rdv-tp is a direct antagonist of adenosine triphosphate atp and blocks the function of rdrp when it takes its place upon elongation of the positive sense rna of the virus by rdrp amirian and levy 2020 gordon et al 2020 figure 1 in a letter to editor in nature journal m wang et al proved for the first time that remdesivir is highly effective in the control of covid-19 infection in vitro at a stage post virus entry  after that many clinics start using remdesivir in a compassionate use for covid-19 patients with severe symptoms with the general feeling that it is helpful although only with a randomized unbiased trial remdesivir could be used in as an official treatment for covid-19 holshue et al 2020 bastola et al 2020 cai et al 2020 hao li and huang 2020 grein et al 2020  while a randomized trial with remdesivir took place in china with 237 patients who were in icu for 12 days found no difference in time to recovery or mortality between the two groups cao deng and dai 2020 ledford 2020 ko et al 2020  very recently april 2020 in an american trial with 1063 patients remdesivir showed the most optimistic results so far for treatment of covid-19 in a randomized clinical trial where patients with serious case of the illness from sars-cov2 treated with remdesivir had a 4 to 5 days faster relief from symptoms and were able to exit icu in comparison with patients treated with a placebo due to the positive and statistically significant result of this study all patients in placebo were treated with remdesivir as well after a data safety monitoring board dsmb which showed significantly positive results even before the study had finished this is the norm for such studies because it would be unethical for patients on the placebo to not receive a treatment that would help them recover faster and easier httpswwwnihgovnewseventsnews-releasesnih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recoveryadvanced-covid-19  another very interesting compound that could have positive effects on the prevention of the sars-cov2 infection is this of famotidine this started when dr michael callahan from massachusetts general hospital visited china and reviewed about 6212 charts of patients who survived or died by covid-19 some of these patients had heartburn which is one of the most common problems to have in the general population and some of them were taking a medication called famotidine known by its trade name as pepcid while another group of patients were taking a more expensive and newer medication for suppressing acid with totally different structure omeprazole known trade name prilosec or nexium what was interestingly observed was that those patients that who were taking the cheaper medication pepcid had a mortality rate of in only 14 whereas in the group of patients with omeprazole the mortality was 27 despite that when they looked at the statistical significance of that they found that the p-value was greater than 005 which means that they couldnt tell whether or not there was a greater than 95 percent chance of confidence that this was random or not httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202004new-york-clinicaltrial-quietly-tests-heartburn-remedy-against-coronavirus in an unrelated study with these observation famotidine was one of the three mostly fitted protein to be predicted computationally as possible targets ofviral protein of sars-cov2 important for its successful infection and replication important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro spike rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and papain like protease plpro were matched structurally with already known compounds with famotidine having one of the highest scores against plpro  plpro is responsible for the cleavages of n-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 which is essential for correcting virus replication harcourt et al 2004  and can antagonize the hosts innate immunity baez-santos st john and mesecar 2015 matthews et al 2014  figure 1 as an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host plpro is a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors and famotidine is structurally shown to be a very plausible candidate taken together with the results from patients taking pepcid as opposed to patients taking isomeprazole for common heartburn on 14 april the us biomedical advanced research and development authority barda has funded scientists in the united states who have now started a randomized placebo controlled trial for intravenously given famotidine in the effort to a successful treatment for covid-19 httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202004new-york-clinical-trial-quietly-testsheartburn-remedy-against-coronavirus ivermectin is like hydroxychloroquine an fda approved medication that already serves a purpose for some other infections but might be helpful with covid-19 as well ivermectin is usually used for parasites and it has been investigated in other viruses like west nile virus and influenza but now several research groups are looking into its use for treatment from the novel coronavirus mercorelli palu and loregian 2018 azeem et al 2015  several viral proteins are believed to be imported in the nucleus of the human cells upon infection with sars-cov2 theres a specific target in the hosts nuclear membrane for this transporting which is conveniently called importin which comes in versions alpha and beta both important for the viral infection what ivermectin does is that it shuts down this ability to transport viral proteins through importins into the nucleus and thus diminishes the ability of the virus to cause harm to the cell figure 1 on april 2020 scientists from australia showed that ivermectin is an inhibitor of the virus sars-cov-2 in vitro when a single addition to vero cells with signaling lymphocytic activation molecule expression vero-hslam cells 2 h post infection with sars-cov-2 it was able to create a 5000-fold reduction in viral rna at 48 h caly et al 2020  maybe the most recent small molecule as of may 2020 to be considered as a potential tool against covid-19 is nicotine two independent groups one from france changeux et al 2020 and one from greece farsalinos et al 2020  have found that except ace2 which is the main receptor of sars-cov2 a secondary receptor for the virus could be the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nachr bencherif et al 2011  this notion is firstly possible due to the fact that about a third of the patients experience anosmia and dysgeusia smell and taste impairment as an early symptom of covid-19 which is connected with nachr mechanisms giacomelli et al 2020  secondly and maybe more importantly even if a high smoking prevalence among patients with covid-19 would be expected due to smokers higher rate of cardiovascular and respiratory defects a 3 fold less from the expected population of smokers was identified with the disease in a chinese study farsalinos et al 2020 wu and mcgoogan 2020  finally it has lately been reported that nicotine is a direct mediator of ace2 receptor leung yang and sin 2020  nicotine is a cholinergic agonist and acts as an important inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines acting through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via 7-nachrs image 1 nicotine inhibits tnf il-1 il-6 and hmgb1 proinflammatory cytokines which are known to be elevated among covid-19 patients  creating a cytokine storm which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure very usually seen in severe covid-19 cases turner et al 2014 ulloa 2005  while undoubtedly smoking cannot be a possible solution for covid-19 prevention it seems really interesting to further investigate the function of nicotine on restoring the function of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system in combination to sars-cov19 infection and replication mechanism in future studies  unfortunately a clear and confirmed treatment for covid-19 remains yet to be found still the most successful way to prevent the spread of sars-cov2 so far is quarantine for affected individuals and physical distancing measures while it is of outmost need to generate a drug or a combination of drugs in order to add another tool against this international pandemic until the development of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus in figure 1 we show how some of the most promising known drugs for other diseases can block the novel coronavirus transport or replication into the host cell currently more than 200 studies with different compounds or other potential treatments with various ways are ongoing in the united states and more than 1000 worlwide source httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2resultsmapcondcovid-19map  but due to the rapid emergence for research many of the efforts lack organizing and randomized clinical trials and remain on the level of anecdotal evidence about their ability to fight covid-19 even with researchers working around-the-clock there still seems to be lack of a centralized national strategy and small-scale trials do not lead to definitive answers for which society is in need now of all times this seems to be stabilized week to week and collaborations among research groups from all over the world and from different fields of expertise give place to small scale efforts such as the remdesivir clinical trial stated above we hope that with efforts like this we will be able to produce solid results in the near future where physicians all over the world will put into practice as soon as possible except for remdesivir we believe that more wide range randomized clinical trials must be done for the compounds stated or other drugs that we didnt discuss in this review in order to have alternative ways to treat patients that inevitably will not be responsive to a certain treatment or this treatment will be prohibited for them due to other conditions that they might have  coronavirus disease 2019 a comprehensive review of etiology pathogenesis diagnosis and ongoing clinical trials alexander muacevic john adler r deepika sarvepalli   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory viral infection related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the disease outbreak started in china in late december 2019 and quickly spread to the rest of the world resulting in a pandemic affecting 210 countries and territories worldwide so far 1 the current mortality rate of the disease is estimated at 61 with the total number of cases at 177 million by april 11 2020 1 the incidence of new cases is increasing in devastating proportions in the united states and is declared a public health emergency 2 this article provides a comprehensive review of the disease epidemiology pathogenesis diagnosis mitigation

infect humans other mammals and birds betacoronavirus is one of the four genera of coronaviruses and comprises some clinically important coronaviruses that can infect humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 coronaviruses are spherical enveloped viruses that contain single ribonucleic acid rna strand non-segmented positive sense and measure about 60-140 nm in diameter 3 the outer surface contains spikes measuring 9-12 nm in length which looks like a crown when looked under a microscope 4 the outer surface of the virus possesses four vital structural proteins which are spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins 56 the s glycoprotein has the ability to attach to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor ace-2 which helps in the fusion and eventual entry of virion particles into the host cell 56 coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses and are spread from animals to humans there are two incidents in the past where human infections have resulted in severe disease the first event was the 2002-2004 sars outbreak where humans got infected by a betacoronavirus named sars-cov that was usually found in bats the epidemic started in china affecting 8422 people and resulting in as many as 916 deaths worldwide 7 later in 2012 another beta group coronavirus mers-cov of bat origin resulted in an outbreak that started in saudi arabia affecting nearly 3000 people and resulting in 858 deaths the mortality rate of the disease was high 34 8 sars-cov-2 pandemic timeline in december 2019 a novel coronavirus was discovered in wuhan city china which was linked to a group of pneumonia cases later the virus was assumed to be transmitted by wild animals to humans and all of the cases were associated with a seafood market 9 on december 31 2019 the world health organization who was informed by the chinese health department about the outbreak 10 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv named the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and who announced the name coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 to refer to the disease caused by the virus 1112 studies have shown that the virus is capable of spreading among humans through droplets fomites and direct contact this was confirmed in an epidemiological investigation on january 20 2020 where two patients with no travel history to wuhan were detected with the virus in guangdong province china far from the original outbreak 13 in january 2020 there was a rapid increase in the number of cases which coupled with global travel resulted in the spread of infection around the globe the who declared the outbreak as the sixth international public health emergency on january 30 2020 10 by march 2020 china had reported a total of 82160 cases of sars-cov-2 infection and the mortality rate was 4 resulting in 3341 fatalities 14 by the middle of february 2020 the infection spread to other countries such as italy iran united kingdom spain france and the united states 15 on january 20 2020 the first case was reported in the united states in the state of washington 16 since then the infection spread to all the 50 states by march 20 2020 1 by april 5 2020 it has affected 375000 people and resulted in almost 10000 deaths 1 the disease is more severe in people with underlying conditions resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiorgan dysfunction 13 as of april 9 2020 the disease has spread to 205 countries and territories worldwide affecting nearly 16 million people and the mortality rate was estimated to be 595 95400 deaths as of april 9 2020 1 epidemiology clinical features and diagnosis the initial symptoms of covid-19 consist of fever chills dry cough sore throat nausea headache myalgias which are similar to those of influenza 17 the unique symptom reported in sars-cov-2 infection is the involvement of the gastrointestinal system vomiting and diarrhea which was not found in the case of sars and mers 18 another interesting feature of covid-19 infection is the presence of asymptomatic carriers who can shed the virus up to 21 days without any clinical signs or symptoms patients with severe illness can present with shortness of breath sob severe respiratory distress and pneumonia there is also increased reporting of new-onset anosmia and ageusia as the only presenting symptoms in some cases 19 the average incubation period for covid-19 is 2-14 days 19 however studies have reported an incubation period of as long as 19-27 days in some cases the incubation period of covid-19 is longer compared to that for mers 5 days and sars 2-7 days a study by wang et al of 138 hospitalized patients reported that the most common symptoms included fever 986 dry cough 594 and fatigue 696 also in that study the median time observed from the first symptoms to complications was five days for dyspnea seven days for hospitalization and eight days for ards 20 these findings are helpful for clinicians who are managing at-risk populations with comorbidities where early identification of complications and timely treatment helps in patient survival chen et al conducted a study of 99 hospitalized people and reported the common symptoms as fever 83 cough 82 and sob 31 21 the findings of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc report of china comprising 72314 case records including confirmed suspected diagnosed and asymptomatic cases were as follows the overall fatality rate was 23 out of 62 confirmed cases and the mortality was higher in the elderly 15 in those aged 80 years and 8 in those aged 70-79 years 22 another interesting finding of the report was that more than half of the critically ill patients had underlying comorbidities such as diabetes chronic lung disease cardiovascular disease and cancer studies have shown that older patients with comorbidities are more susceptible to complications such as respiratory failure multiorgan dysfunction such as shock acute cardiac injury acute kidney injury and even death in severe cases 22 several diagnostic tests were developed to detect the presence of covid-19 infection such as real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr reverse transcription polymerase chain rt-pcr reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa 23 recently in the united states on march 28 2020 abbott laboratories got the fda approval for the portable point-of-care antibody test kit that can deliver test results within 15 minutes 24 studies have shown that the blood cell profile of covid-19 patients consists of decreased white blood cell wbc count lymphopenia thrombocytopenia rnaemia elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and c-reactive protein crp and mildly elevated procalcitonin secondary infection levels 25 moreover severe cases were associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase ldh alanine transaminase alt creatinine and prothrombin time 13 radiological findings of covid-19 patients show a variety of changes such as ground-glass opacities bilateral lung involvement with multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation mottling and pneumothorax 13 in addition histological findings such as hyaline membrane formation fibromyxoid exudates diffuse alveolar damage and desquamation of pneumocytes were observed in critically ill patients 1325 the leading cause of mortality in critically ill covid-19 happened to be due to respiratory failure from severe bilateral pneumonia 13 studies have shown that sars-cov-2 causes cytopathic damage to airway epithelial cells which can result in the activation of severe and dysregulated immune responses ultimately leading to ards 13 histological examination of patients with ards has shown hyperactive cytotoxic t-cells filled with large volumes of cytotoxic granules 13 in addition studies have shown that critically ill patients with covid-19 have elevated levels of interleukin il 6 due to a hyperinflammation process called cytokine storm syndrome 26 high levels of il-6 are responsible for shock respiratory failure and multiorgan failure in these patients 26 in addition cellular immune mechanisms are also thought to be responsible for the grave prognosis in severe disease damage to t lymphocytes resulting in lymphopenia and increased susceptibility to secondary infections were also observed in critically ill patients 13 elevation of proinflammatory cytokines along with the suppression of anti-inflammatory cytokines suggests the cellular immune response against the sars-cov-2 13 the humoral immune response has a role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 there is a decrease in levels of immunoglobulins in covid-19 which indicates the effects on antibody-producing b lymphocytes 21 though antigens of sars-cov-2 have shown potential for stimulating antibody production the impact of overall lymphopenia may have caused depletion of immunoglobulins 21 the s and n proteins on the surface of the coronavirus are thought to elicit immune responses 27 in severely ill covid-19 patients the virus-specific antibodies are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammation cytokine storm and depletion of lymphocytes through a process called antibody-dependent enhancement 28 the blood profile of hospitalized patients showed an elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio along with a decrease in monocytes basophils and eosinophils 29 in addition a depletion of both t and b lymphocytes and natural killer nk cells was seen in critically ill patients with suppression of all subsets of t cells such as helper t cells regulatory t cells and suppressor t cells was observed the cytokine storm in severely ill patients results in elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma including interferon gamma ifn- il-1 beta tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf and il-8 il-10 il-6 and il-2 29 therefore detection of il-6 can play a significant role in estimating the severity of the disease studies have shown that sars-cov-2 can result in hyperinflammation of lungs and further fibrosis by the release of il-1 mediated by the attachment of the virions to toll-like receptors tlr 30 therefore drugs targeting il-1 could be potentially beneficial in severely ill patients mitigation measures and clinical trials prevention is the mainstay of blocking the disease spread and lowering the mortality rate proper handwashing maintaining at least 6 feet of social distancing while in public and self-isolation and quarantining when suspicious of disease contraction are a few ways of preventing disease transmission there are several ongoing studies dedicated to assessing the treatment options for covid-19 some of the drugs under investigation include remdesivir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine tocilizumab and convalescent serum wang et al conducted in vitro studies on the sars-cov-2 specimen and investigated the effectiveness of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin penciclovir remdesivir gs- 5734 and favipiravir t-705 and few other medications such as nitazoxanide nafamostat and chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 31 the findings of their study showed that remdesivir and chloroquine had the potential of inhibiting the virus in cell cultures remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that exhibits antiviral properties through incorporation into the nascent viral rna chains and further resulting in their early termination studies of remdesivir on the mice cell lines and nonhuman primate nhp cell lines have shown positive results against coronaviruses such as sars and mers-cov and on ebola virus 31 the results of the study by wang et al showed that remdesivir was able to attain the required concentrations inside the monkey cell lines infected with the virus moreover remdesivir was able to inhibit the infection effectively in the human liver huh-7 cells the second drug chloroquine is an immunosuppressive and anti-malarial drug traditionally used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus in vitro studies have shown that chloroquine has the potential to inhibit sars-cov-2 through mechanisms including raising the ph inside the endosomes which prevents the fusion of the virus with the infected cell and interrupting the glycosylation of viral receptors 31 in addition to the antiviral properties the immunosuppressive properties of chloroquine showed a cumulative benefit in viral inhibition in cell lines 31 with that said in vivo studies and studies on patients infected with sars-cov-2 are necessary to assess the potential of these drugs in treating covid-19 with minimal to no side effects in france gautret et al conducted an open-label non-randomized small population study on hospitalized patients with covid-19 32 in their study patients were given a combination of chloroquine and azithromycin the criteria for patient selection were age  12 years and detection of sars-cov-2 antigens in the nasal swab on pcr test at admission irrespective of their clinical status 32 patients who were pregnant and breastfeeding and those with contraindications to chloroquine such as retinopathy qt prolongation and deficiency of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd enzyme were excluded from the study the primary endpoint of the study was a negative test result on the nasopharyngeal swab test after six days of treatment the study enrolled 42 patients based on the above criteria out of which 26 people were put on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as needed and the remaining 16 were put on the control group 32 patients were classified into three groups based on their symptoms asymptomatic upper respiratory tract infection urti group with symptoms such as fever body aches rhinitis and pharyngitis and lower respiratory tract infections lrti group with symptoms of bronchitis and pneumonia 32 the results of the study were as follows 100 of the patients who received both the drugs showed resolution of the viral load when compared with patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone 571 and control population 125 32 moreover the effectiveness of the treatment was more significant in urti and lrti groups compared with asymptomatic patients by the end of february 2020 there were almost seven clinical trials that reviewed the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 people in china 33 liu et al conducted in vitro studies evaluating the effect of both the drugs against sars-cov-2 33 their study demonstrated a similar drug profile to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in terms of cytotoxicity drug concentration in target cells and tissue distribution previously several clinical studies have shown that hospitalized and critically ill patients with covid-19 exhibit excessive levels of cytokines in their plasma compared to the less symptomatic people suggesting the role of cytokines in disease severity 33 hydroxychloroquine possesses good anti-inflammatory properties and is thought to be more effective in these patients liu et al concluded their results by stating that hydroxychloroquine has the potential to inhibit sars-cov-2 infection effectively the study also highlighted the adverse effects of the drug and its low safety index 33 at this point further clinical trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 studies have reported that hyperactivation of humoral immune responses and release of il-6 was observed in critically patients with covid-19 26 therefore drugs targeting il-6 receptors such as tocilizumab could be a potential benefit for these patients tocilizumab is a biological agent used in moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis that acts by binding to il-6 receptors thereby inhibiting the effects of il-6 in china and italy a non-randomized open-label study was conducted where 21 critically ill patients with covid-19 were treated with tocilizumab 34 all the patients were put on a standard therapy consisting of lopinavir and methylprednisolone in addition to intravenous tocilizumab 400 mg all the patients in the study reported resolution of symptoms such as fever within 24 hours of the start of the treatment 34 moreover 75 of the patients reported a significant decrease in oxygen requirement within two to five days after receiving treatment and 90 of the patients had resolution of pneumonia radiologically as well 34 the study did not report any side effects of the treatment however more evidence in terms of positive outcomes in large patient groups is necessary to substantiate the results of the study in late april 2020 wang et al published the findings of their randomized case-control study on the effectiveness of intravenous remdesivir in severely ill covid-19 patients 35 the study recruited 237 patients from 10 hospitals in wuhan china who met the following criteria age  18 years lab-confirmed infection with sars-cov-2 onset of symptoms to enrollment  12 days oxygen saturation  94 on room air and chest x-ray findings positive for pneumonia patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding those with complications of liver disease such as cirrhosis elevated liver enzymes 5 times normal and renal impairment and dialysis patients were excluded from the study concurrent therapy with other medications such as steroids lopinavir-ritonavir and interferons was allowed clinical improvement within 28 days of starting remdesivir was the primary endpoint of the study the study reported that patients in the remdesivir group achieved clinical improvement faster when compared with placebo in patients with symptoms for 10 days hazard ratio 152 95 ci 095-243 35 however the results were not statistically significant and the relatively small patient population might be one of the reasons other limitations of the study include remdesivir introduction in the late stage of the disease and insufficient data on patient recovery as remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse effects anemia thrombocytopenia and elevated bilirubin 35 apart from the drug trials other notable studies include the effectiveness of passive immunization and the use of convalescent plasmaantibodies in critically ill covid-19 patients antibody treatment has been successfully used in the treatment of infectious diseases in the past a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in acute viral infections such as sars-cov and mers-cov has shown positive results in terms of decrease of viral load and case fatality rates 36 a study in china has reported that 10 critically ill people have shown positive results when treated with antibodies from recovered people including improved o2 saturation and decreased viral load 37 studies have postulated that the antibodies have the potential to neutralize the viral particles and inhibit further infection of new cells and to activate complement and phagocytosis however the treatment is associated with few adverse effects in addition to ethical issues and careful donor selection antibody treatment is associated with the risk of thrombosis 004-149 38 in addition to these studies there are some ongoing vaccine trials across the globe against the coronavirus finally there are more than 600 including withdrawn clinical trials dedicated to the management of covid-19 in the united states more than 50 active studies are currently being conducted and some of the clinical trials are shown in table 1 39 the covid-19 outbreak has been overwhelming to the nations in terms of economy and public health aspects of curbing the disease spread and keeping the incidence of cases to the lowest level possible furthermore disease management has been challenging for the clinicians and other medical personnel in terms of treatment options and the availability of personal protective equipment the off-label use of some drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and emergency use authorization of remdesivir can hopefully help the clinicians while treating critically ill patients the use of convalescent serum has also shown some interim benefit until a definitive treatment and preventive options are uncovered such as vaccines and other effective treatment regimens  role of 1-ribose cyano substitution for remdesivir to effectively inhibit both nucleotide addition and proofreading in sars-cov- 2 viral rna replication lu zhang dong zhang congmin yuan xiaowei wang yongfang li xilin jia xin gao hui-ling yen peter  pak-hang cheung xuhui huang  covid-19 has recently caused a global health crisis and an effective interventional therapy is urgently needed sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp provides a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease exon function nucleoside triphosphate ntp analogues added to the growing rna chain should supposedly terminate viral rna replication but exon can cleave the incorporated compounds and counteract their efficacy remdesivir targeting sars-cov-2 rdrp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo however its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive here we performed all-atom molecular dynamics md simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 126 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of remdesivir in nucleotide addition rdrp complex nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 and proofreading exon complex nsp14-nsp10 we found that the 1-cyano group of remdesivir possesses the dual role of inhibiting both nucleotide addition and proofreading for nucleotide addition we showed that incorporation of one remdesivir is not sufficient to terminate rna synthesis instead the presence of the polar 1-cyano group of remdesivir at an upstream site causes instability via its electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge formed by asp865 and lys593 rendering translocation unfavourable this may eventually lead to a delayed chain termination of rna extension by three nucleotides for proofreading remdesivir can inhibit cleavage via the steric clash between the 1-cyano group and asn104 to further examine the role of 1-cyano group in remdesivirs inhibitory effects we studied three additional ntp analogues with other types of modifications favipiravir vidarabine and fludarabine our simulations suggest that all three of them are prone to exon cleavage our computational findings were further supported by an in vitro assay in vero e6 cells using live sars-cov-2 the dose-response curves suggest that among tested ntp analogues only remdesivir exerts significant inhibitory effects on viral replication our work provides plausible mechanisms at molecular level on how remdesivir inhibits viral rna replication and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of covid-19 targeting viral replication  the 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 coronavirus cov or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly to cause serious outbreaks and eventually a pandemic around the world as of april 2020 covid-19 has been reported in 210 countries and almost 3 million cases have been confirmed resulting in more than 200000 deaths with an estimated mortality risk of 691 1  the new cov has been declared a global emergency by the world health organization as the outbreak continues to spread globally and no clinically approved interventional therapy is currently available to curb this health crisis antiviral agents are urgently needed to treat covid-19 patients it could take up years to develop new interventions including therapeutic antibodies cytokines nucleic acid-based therapies and vaccines hence repurposing clinically approved or investigative drugs for other diseases provides a promising approach to develop covid-19 treatments cov has a capsid that envelops the single-stranded rna genome 2  three structural surface proteins are shown to be associated with the capsid viral membrane envelope and the spike protein 3  because sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share 89 nucleotide identity 4  chemical compounds and monoclonal antibodies that target sars-cov surface proteins or interrupt its binding to host viral receptor have been under investigation for treating sars-cov-2 5 6 7  in addition new vaccines targeting the viral surface antigens are under intense development for the prevention of covid-19 unfortunately drugs and vaccines with inhibitory mechanisms targeting surface receptors may not be effective due to the constant evolution of surface receptors to acquire drug resistance and evade host immune response 8  in contrast viral rna-dependent-rna polymerase rdrp is a protein that is deeply buried inside the viral capsule and is functionally conserved for viral replication rendering it resistant to the propagation of drug-resistant virus thus rdrp serves as a promising drug target for virus infections 9  indeed inhibitors targeting polymerase of sars-cov-2 is currently at late stages of clinical trials compared with other viral rdrp such as influenza virus and rhinovirus sars-cov-2 rdrp is more challenging for drug development due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease exon function non-structural protein nsp 12 along with cofactors nsp8 with nsp7 is involved in nascent rna priming and nucleotide addition 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  ntp analogues that inhibit nucleotide addition in nsp12 supposedly should inhibit rna replication however in sars-cov-2 exon of nsp14 has been shown to play a pivotal role in proofreading 17  to counteract the efficacy of the ntp analogues nsp14 excises the incorporated ntp analogues 18 19  for example the ntp analogue ribavirin is being incorporated in the nascent rna to inhibit nucleotide addition of sars-cov rdrp however ribavirin is readily excised from nascent rna by nsp14 which may explain its limited efficacy in vivo 16  remdesivir is a promising drug candidate to treat covid-19 infection 20 21 22  it has been shown to be effective as compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalised with covid-19 22  including those suffering from pneumonia 20  subsequently clinical trials on using remdesivir to treat covid-19 have been conducted 1  remdesivir has shown to be a potent inhibitor of cov replication including the mers-cov sars-cov and circulating human covs 19 23  even though remdesivir is an ntp analogue incorporated by rdrp it exerts superior antiviral activity over other ntp analogues because the rate of incorporation of remdesivir to nascent rna by nsp12 is higher than that of its cleavage by nsp14 exon 19  recently enormous amount of efforts has been placed in understanding the molecular basis of remdesivirs inhibitory mechanisms on rna synthesis 14 15 24 25 26 27  due to the high sequence similarity between sars and sars-2 the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 and nsp14-nsp10 of sars-cov serve as reliable models to study the mechanisms of rna replication of sars-cov-2 furthermore the cryo-em structures of sars-cov-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 have been recently solved 14 15  with the catalytic domain of nsp12 showing very high structural similarity to that of sars-cov 12 16  however only one of these sars-cov polymerase structures contains the nascent and template strands which is in the pre-translocation state with pyrophosphate ion ppi still bound at the active site 15  hence molecular mechanisms particularly the dynamics of the nucleotide addition cycle of either ntp or ntp analogues remain largely unknown biochemical assays have shown in mers cov 24 and recently in sars-cov-2 15 25 that remedivir causes delayed chain termination in rna synthesis wherein several rounds of nucleotide additions can still proceed after remdesivir incorporation prior to completed termination however the molecular mechanisms underlying this delayed termination induced by remdesivir remain largely elusive furthermore it is also not clear how remdesivir can evade the proofreading activity of sars-cov-2 to prevent itself from being cleaved by exon to elucidate the mechanisms of remdesivir inhibition on rdrp and exon we conducted an aggregation of 126 s all-atom molecular dynamics md simulations of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 and nsp14-nsp10 complexes in sars-cov-2 for rdrp our md simulations show that remdesivir at the 3-terminal can reduce the efficiency of nucleotide addition in nsp12 more interestingly we found that remdesivir at an upstream site i3 site can block translocation via interactions formed by its 1-cyano group and thus results in delayed chain termination for exon we found that the relatively bulky 1-cyano group on the ribose of remdesivir introduces steric interactions and effectively disrupts the stability of the catalytic active conformation and thus effectively inhibit the exonuclease activity of exon furthermore our md simulations of three additional ntp analogues containing other base and ribose modifications favipiravir vidarabine and fludarabine suggest that they are all prone to be cleaved by exon underlining the important role of the 1-cyano substitution in remdesivir our simulation results are supported by an in vitro assay to examine the efficiency of ntp analogues in inhibiting sars-cov-2 live virus growth we found that only remdesivir shows inhibitory effect consistent with our md simulations remdesivir can reduce the efficiency of nucleotide addition in rdrp our structural model of sars-cov-2 rdrp nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 has been constructed based on the cryo-em structure of sars-cov rdrp pdbid 6nur 12  see fig 1a  template and nascent rna strands have been constructed by the structural alignment of modelled sars-cov-2 rdrp to the norovirus rdrp pdbid 3h5y 28  see methods and si section 11 for details twenty replicas of 30-ns md simulations were performed for the rdrp in the posttranslocation state in which the active site i site is occupied by adenosine triphosphate atp  fig 1a and 1c see si section 221 for details to validate this model named as wildtype-rna we first examined the stability of the active site by assessing the distance between the a phosphate pa of atp and o3 atom of the 3-terminal nucleotide  fig 2a  typically such distance is required to be below 4  to allow efficient catalysis to form the phosphodiester bond eg 34  in the structure of norovirus rdrp 28 and 3540  suggested by previous computational studies 29 30  consistent with this distance requirement we found that the distribution of the o3-pa distance peaks at 35  see the gray curve in fig 2a  furthermore the base-to-base distance between atp and its base-paired template nucleotide was also measured as an estimation of base-pairing stability 31  we found that such base-to-base distance is most populated at 75  similar to the distance of 7476  as observed in structures of other viral polymerases 28 32 fig 2d  in addition we investigated base stacking stability as another criteria for the propensity of nucleotide addition 31  we found that the distance between the base of ntp and the base of 3-terminal nucleotide is most populated at 45  fig 2g  consistent with the distance of 42  as observed in norovirus 28 and poliovirus 32 rdrps in addition to assessing the active site stability we further validated our structural model against three recently solved cryo-em structures of sars-cov-2 rdrp 14-15 see fig 3 and si section 42 for details for the two apo structures the root-mean-square-deviation rmsd of ca atoms was used as comparison to our model we found that the averaged rmsds are 236  pdbid 6m71 14 and 230  pdbid 7bv1 15  indicating that the overall architecture of our nsp12 model is similar to that of the apo cryo-em structures of sars-cov-2 for the holo structure the rmsds of ca atoms and nucleotides between our structural model and the holo cryo-em structure pdbid 7bv2 15  were 212  and 223  respectively this further validated our wildtype-rna model finally we also examined the interactions between upstream rna and proteins and found that most of the interactions 73 observed in the holo cryo-em structure are well maintained in our md simulations fig s1  after validating our structural model we next performed twenty 30-ns md simulations with remdesivir-tp replacing atp at the active site i site see si section 222 for details interestingly we found that the distribution of the critical o3-pa distance in the remdesivir-tp system is still largely below 4  even though it is substantially broader compared to atp  fig 2a  these results suggest that the incorporation of remdesivir-tp is still allowed but with a reduced efficiency compared to atp furthermore no obvious negative effect on base pairing and base stacking stability is induced by remdesivir-tp at i site  fig 2d and 2g  altogether our observations suggest that remdesivir-tp can largely maintain a catalytically active conformation and thus can be added to the 3-end of the nascent rna chain even at a reduced efficiency therefore remdesivir satisfies the pre-requisite condition to act as a chaintermination inhibitor after remdesivir is added to the rna chain and translocated to the adjacent upstream site i1 site we found that remdesivir can reduce the efficiency of addition for the next nucleotide at the active site in this case we also performed twenty 30-ns md simulations with remdesivir at 3-terminal i1 site to examine atp incorporation at the active site see si section 222 for details we found that the incoming atp becomes less stable when remdesivir is at the i1 site in particular the pa-o3 distance becomes larger and shifts to 37  on average fig  1b  moreover the base stacking stability is substantially weakened with more md conformations showing larger base-to-base distance than wildtype-rna fig 1h  these observations suggest that remdesivir at i1 site can reduce the efficiency of the next ntp addition at i site to examine if remdesivir at further upstream positions of the nascent rna strand can interfere with ntp incorporation we performed twenty 30-ns md simulations for each of the systems with remdesivir at i2 i3 and i4 sites see si section 222 for details the histogram of critical distances of ntp incorporation shows no obvious discrepancy from that of wildtype-rna figs 1c 1f 1i and s2 this suggests that remdesivir at i2 i3 or i4 site has negligible impact on the nucleotide addition at the active site altogether we expect that remdesivir-tp can be incorporated into the nascent strand and subsequently would reduce the efficiency of addition of the next incoming ntp however we expect that this reduction may not be sufficient to completely abolish the rna synthesis suggesting that other mechanisms may exist for remdesivir to inhibit rdrp function remdesivir has been proposed as a delayed chain terminator for the rdrps of respiratory syncytial virus 33  nipah virus 34  and mers-cov 24  recent biochemical experiments for sars-cov-2 rdrp also demonstrated delayed chain termination by remdesivir-tp at physiological concentrations 15 25  although nucleotide addition may be terminated earlier when excess amount of remdesivir-tp is present 15  for mers-cov 24 and sars-cov-2 15 25 rna replication remdesivir induced delayed chain termination wherein the addition efficiency of the first few nucleotides is maintained however nucleotide addition is abruptly abolished at a specific upstream site with a 3-nucleotide delay the molecular mechanisms underlining this delayed chain termination remain largely elusive to elucidate mechanisms of the delayed termination we performed md simulations for rdrp with remdesivir added to the nascent rna strand and at different sites i to i4 site during the translocation process to obtain statistically meaningful results we performed twenty 30-ns md simulations for each of these systems see si section 222 for details to investigate the propensity of translocation we first inspect how remdesivir may impact stability of the rdrp complex by examining probability of hydrogen bonds formed between remdesivir and its template uracil as shown in fig 4a and fig s3  the hydrogen bonds of remdesiviru are nearly intact when remdesivir is at i i1 and i2 sites in both pre-pre-t and posttranslocation post-t states suggesting that translocation of remdesivir is allowed in these systems it is worth mentioning that interactions between remdesivir at i site and surrounding residues in our model are consistent with those in the recently solved sars-cov-2 rdrp holo structure 15 fig s4  our observations are also consistent with a recent structural modelling study which suggests that remdesivir at the active site i site cannot hinder translocation 26  in sharp contrast we found that remdesivir at i3 site greatly weakens the hydrogen bond probability of base pairing with its template uracil fig 4a  further investigations show that the presence of the highly polar 1-cyano group on remdesivir will exert strong electrostatic attractions 161 kjmol with the salt bridge formed by lys593 and asp865 of rdrp fig  4b  these electrostatic attractions will further pull remdesivir away from its canonical conformation and cause the destabilization of its base pairing fig 4b  indeed the hydrogen bonds for the base pairing of remdesiviru are subsequently disrupted rendering the corresponding rdrp complex unstable fig 4a  recently solved cryo-em structure 15 also shows that lys593 d46  and asp865 d43  are in spatial proximity with 1-cyano group when remdesivir was modelled at i3 site for translocation of rna polymerases a post-t state with the empty active site often has comparable stability with its corresponding pre-t state and subsequent binding of ntp can greatly stabilize post-t state and favor forward translocation 35  we thus anticipate that translocation of remdesivir into i3 site post-t will still be allowed due to the stabilization of ntp binding but after ntp incorporation the unstable complex with remdesivir at i3 site may hinder the rna extension next we investigate if this instability induced by remdesivir at i3 site can affect the dynamics of subsequent translocation to i4 site by generating a translocation pathway using the climber algorithm 35 36 see methods and si section 3 for details interestingly we found that the 1cyano group need to first move closer to the negatively charged asp865 before it translocates away to i4 site while its distance with lys593 is noticeably larger than that with asp865 during translocation fig 4c  as the electron-withdrawing 1-cyano moiety exhibits d --anion repulsion with asp865 the intermediate conformation with reduced distance to asp865 will experience unfavorable repulsions 105 kjmol raised energy see fig 4d  and we expect that this may hinder forward translocation fig 4c  altogether the above observations suggest a delayed termination of three nucleotides as observed in sars-cov-2 25 and mers-cov 24  gordon et al 25 proposed an alternative explanation where the steric clash between ser861 and remdesivir would inhibit translocation from i3 site to i4 site in our translocation simulation we found that the 1-cyano group of remdesivir constantly approaches ser861 with their distance monotonically decreased from 7  to around 3  fig 4c  however we did not observe strong steric clashes between ser861 and remdesivir nevertheless due to its spatial proximity we anticipate that ser861 may still play an auxiliary role to the inhibition of translocation based on homology modelling shannon et al 26 proposed another mechanism where translocation is inhibited due to the steric clash between arg858 and remdesivirs ribose at i4 site however our md simulations with remdesivir at i4 site show a large distance 114  between arg858 and 1-cyano group of remdesivir fig s5a  consistent with our simulations a large separation of 95  between arg858 and the 1-cyano group of remdesivir was also observed when we modelled remdesivir at i4 site using the recent cryo-em structure pdbid 7bv2 15  see fig s5b  to obtain the translocation pathway we adopted the climber method 35 36  in which the rdrp complex is progressively driven from pre-t to post-t state by external energy to rigorously study dynamics of large-scale conformational changes during translocation we need to apply more advanced methods such as markov state model 35 37-42  which is beyond the scope of our current study finally comparison of the sequences between sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses indicates that the asp865 --lys593  salt bridge is conserved except that lys was replaced by another positively charged arg in two human covs fig s6  implying that our proposed mechanism may be employed by other cov rdrp one main challenge for drug design targeting sars-cov-2 rdrp is due to the existence of an exon domain in nsp14 which binds to nsp12 and performs proofreading function that can remove incorporated ntp analogues and counteract the efficacy of the inhibitory compounds therefore an additional criterion to be an effective inhibitor sars-cov-2 viral replication is the ability to escape from the cleavage by exon next we examine how efficient remdesivir is being cleaved by exon we built the structural model for nsp14 bound with its activator nsp10 based on the crystal structure of nsp14-nsp10 of sars-cov pdbid 5c8s 43  as previous work suggests that three nucleotide base pairs are melted in the active site of exon 44  we modelled a singlestranded rna containing three nucleotides based on structural alignment to dna polymerase i klenow fragment 44 and dna polymerase iii e subunit 45 see method and si section 12 for details twenty 30-ns md simulations were performed for the wildtype-rna in which the 3-terminal is occupied by adenine see si section 231 for details to assess the stability of cleavage site we examined the distance between mga and the o3 atom of the second last nucleotide at the 3-terminal as it is essential for cleavage 46 47 48 fig 5a  this distance is well maintained in most of the simulations fig s7  and the histogram shows only one peak in the region of 2025  fig 5a  suitable for cleavage 46 47 48  mga-mgb distance is also critical for cleavage 46 47 48 49 and our calculations show a sharp peak at  36  fig 5b  a distance permissible for cleavage 46 47 48 49  by sharp contrast md simulations with remdesivir at 3-terminal show destabilization of cleavage site in exon with the coordination between mga and o3 atoms more frequently disrupted fig s8  consistently a second peak appears at 37 in the distribution of o3-mga distance indicating that remdesivir causes an increase in the population of cleavage-inhibited configurations fig 5a  this increase was also observed in the histogram of mga-mgb distance with a second peak clearly appearing at 49  fig 5b  further examination of the base stepping twisting angle fig s9 shows that the base of remdesivir twists more significantly than that of adenine fig 5c  which also suggests that remdesivir is experiencing unfavorable interactions at the 3-terminal all these observations indicate that remdesivir is not stable in the cleavage site and hence not prone to be cleaved structural analysis based on md conformations with remdesivir at the 3-terminal indicates that the bulky 1-cyano group plays a key role in protecting remdesivir from exon cleavage the cleavage site is on the surface of nsp14 protein and the base of nucleotides are exposed to the solvent in contrast the ribose ring is more buried within the protein environment thus it is more susceptible to any instability incurring at the cleavage site the wildtype nucleotide does not have a bulky group attached at the ribose ring hence no specific steric effect is observed in the cleavage site as shown by a representative conformation of wildtype-rna fig  5e  conversely the 1-cyano group of remdesivir causes steric clash with the side chain of protein residue asn104 this steric repulsion separates asn104 and remdesivir apart from each other as consolidated by the larger distance between the base of asn104 and nitrogen atom in the amide group of asn104 fig 5d  this steric interaction is clearly demonstrated in representative conformations as shown in fig 5f  on one hand if remdesivir adopts a similar conformation as wildtype-rna at 3-terminal the cyano group will push down the side chain of asn104 on the other hand if the side chain of asn104 maintains its configuration as in the wildtype-rna the steric interaction will push the ribose along with the base of remdesivir rotating away fig 5f  therefore we attribute the destabilization of remdesivir at cleavage site to the steric repulsion between 1-cyano group of remdesivir and asn104 this observation from md simulations is consistent with a recent study based on static structural model of nsp14 of sars-cov-2 which also proposes that the 1-cyano group has steric clash with the cleavage site 26  this destabilization would reduce the possibility of remdesivir to be excised by exon enabling remdesivir to be an effective inhibitor for sars-cov-2 to further understand important chemical features of remdesivir allowing it to inhibit nucleotide addition and cleavage in the viral replication of sars-cov-2 we explored the inhibitory effects of three additional ntp analogues containing various chemical structure features favipiravir vidarabine and fludarabine all these three compounds are fda approved drugs and display the same hydrogen bonding pattern as the corresponding natural adenine nucleotide fig 6a  however they are structurally different from adenine in either the base favipiravir or the ribose vidarabine like remdesivir fludarabine has modifications in both the base and ribose therefore examination of these ntp analogues can provide insights on the types of modifications that may benefit inhibitor design we first performed md simulations by placing the triphosphate form of the ntp analogue in the active site i site see si section 222 for details to evaluate if these ntp analogues could satisfy the criteria of being incorporated into the nascent strand in rdrp as potential chain terminators favipiravir-tp and vidarabine-tp were shown to possess similar mean pa-o3 distance 40  compared with remdesivir fig 6b  this distance is significantly raised to 50  for fludarabine-tp implicating the difficulty of fludarabine to be incorporated into the nascent rna strand further inspection of the md conformations revealed that the instability of fludarabine-tp in the active site could be attributed to the fluoro-substitution on the base fluorine atom is electronegative and causes a d --drepulsion with the oxygen atom in the base of the template uracil fig s10  thus destabilizing its configuration at the active site the baseto-base distance between the ntp analogue and the template nucleotide in the active site only marginally increased by  025  for all the ntp analogues compared to wildtype-rna fig  s11a  similarly the mean base stacking distances for the ntp analogues are equal to or even shorter than that for atp fig s11c  these observations suggest that all ntp analogues except fludarabine-tp satisfy the structural feature criteria to be incorporated into the nascent strand we next examined if these ntp analogues can inhibit nucleotide addition by placing them at 3-terminal i1 site with atp in the active site twenty 30-ns md simulations were performed for each of these systems see si section 222 for details for favipiravir we found that the averaged o3-pa distance is 36  when favipiravir is at i1 site similar to that when remdesivir is at i1 site fig 6c  demonstrating favipiravirs weak capability to reduce the efficiency for the next ntp incorporation vidarabine and fludarabine were shown to have even shorter distance 33  than wildtype-rna due to an extra hydrogen bond formed between their 2-hydroxyl group of the ntp analogue and 4-oxygen of ntp hydrogen bond probability of 89 and 94 for vidarabine and fludarabine respectively base-to-base distance between ntp and the template nucleotides are not perturbed by the presence of the ntp analogue at i1 site fig s11b  favipiravir also shows similar base stacking distance as wildtype-rna while this distance is slightly increased by around 0304  for vidarabine and fludarabine fig s11d  in addition as none of these three ntp analogues contains a bulky substitution group on the ribose like 1-cyano on remdesivir fig 6a  we anticipate that it will be unlikely for them to inhibit rna synthesis via a delayed termination mechanism altogether we expect that favipiravir can reduce ntp incorporation to a similar extent as remdesivir while vidarabine and fludarabine at i1 do not reduce ntp incorporation due to the shortening of the o3-pa distance therefore based on the comprehensive analysis of three ntp analogues performance in rdrp favipiravir is the most possible candidate next we examined if these ntp analogues could inhibit proofreading of exon by placing them at the 3-terminal of the nascent rna strand see si section 232 for details for all three ntp analogues the o3-mga and mga-mgb distances were comparable to that when adenine is at the 3-terminal implicating that they are more prone to be excised by exon figs 6d and s12a furthermore these three ntp analogues adopt similar configuration as adenine in the cleavage site fig s13 and do not experience any steric clashes with asn104 fig 6e  we anticipate that the stability of the three compounds at the cleavage site can be attributed to the lack of bulky substitutions at 1-ribose this is consistent with our proposal that the bulky 1-cyano group causes steric effect contributing to the instability of the cleavage site altogether our results suggest that these three ntp analogues are more prone to be excised than remdesivir implicating that they are not effective to inhibit rna replication of sars-cov-2 to consolidate the above-mentioned simulation results we performed in vitro experiments in vero e6 cells and show that ntp analogues favipiravir vidarabine and fludarabine indeed fail to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication fig 6f  in particular we performed in vitro tissue culture assays using live sars-cov-2 virus to examine the antiviral effect of remdesivir favipiravir vidarabine and fludarabine against sars-cov-2 virus among the four ntp analogues tested only remdesivir was found to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication in vero e6 cells with ec50 under 100 m fig 6f  this is consistent with our previous work 50  which determined the ec50 of vidarabine to be 2315 m and 2690 m using virus titer and real-time pcr respectively other ntp analogues vidarabine fludarabine and favipiravir did not inhibit viral replication under 100 m fig 6f  however it is worthy to note that ntp analogues require conversions into their triphosphate forms by host nucleoside kinases whose activity may differ among cell types hence further evaluation of the effect of these ntp analogues in primary cells such as primary human airway epithelial cells that more clinically relevant is needed considering the inhibition effect of all three ntp analogues in rdrp and exon we found that none of them exhibits superior inhibitory activity than remdesivir our work elucidates the molecular mechanism for their lack of inhibitory effects on rna synthesis fludarabine has the lowest tendency to be incorporated into the nascent strand while vidarabine could not reduce the efficiency of incoming ntp incorporation in sars-cov-2 rdrp favipiravir demonstrates similar performance as remdesivir in rdrp however favipiravir is highly likely to be cleaved in exon hence only remdesivir can inhibit rna synthesis in rdrp and simultaneously avoid its excision by the exon of sars-cov-2 rdrp in this study we have elucidated the important role of 1-cyano group on the ribose in remdesivirs inhibition effect targeted rna replication fig 7  extensive md simulations were performed based on the structural model of rdrp and exon of sars-cov-2 remdesivir at i1 site can reduce nucleotide addition at the active site but cannot fully inhibit nucleotide addition instead remdesivir mainly inhibits nucleotide addition via a delayed chain terminating mechanism where the growing rna chain will be terminated once a few nucleotides are added after remdesivir incorporation we propose a model where the polar 1cyano group of remdesivir at the upstream i3 site will cause instability of the rdrp complex because the salt bridge asp865 --lys593   will pull remdesivir away from its canonical conformation to break its base pairing furthermore the dynamic transition of translocation from i3 site to i4 site will be further hindered due to unfavorable anion-drepulsion between asp865 and the 1-cyano group of remdesivir as a result remdesivir leads to a delayed termination of three nucleotides in addition remdesivir was found to be capable of inhibiting the proofreading function of exon the 1-cyano group of remdesivir exhibits steric clash with a nearby residue asn104 which destabilizes remdesivir at the active site rendering it resistant to exon cleavage further investigation using three other ntp analogues showed different inhibiting effects on nucleotide addition in rdrp albeit all of them are more prone to be cleaved than remdesivir comparison among the structural modifications of remdesivir with other three ntp analogues suggests that the modification on the ribose possibility by using a bulky group substitution may be a better strategy than on the base to inhibit the rna synthesis of sars-cov-2 our work provides mechanistic insights at atomistic details on how remdesivir can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 rna synthesis we also revealed that the chemical modification at the ribose of remdesivir that carries the dual inhibitory function to terminate both nucleotide addition and proofreading could be a promising general strategy for designing prospective nucleoside-analog inhibitors to treat covid-19 the cryo-em structure of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex pdbid 6nur 12 and the norovirus holo-rdrp pdbid 3h5y 28  were used as the structural basis to construct the ncov rdrp containing dsrna strands with atp bound at the active site see si section 11 for details the protonation states of histidines were predicted using propka30 module 51 in the pdbpqr221 52 package followed by manual investigation to ensure that the coordination with the zinc ion can be formed the whole complex was placed in a dodecahedron box with the box edges at least 12 away from the complex surface the box was filled with tip3p water molecules 53  and enough counter ions were added to make the whole system neutral the crystal structure of nsp10-nsp14 complex of sars-cov pdbid 5c8s 43  serves as the structural basis to construct the nsp10-nsp14 of sars-cov-2 see si section 12 for details missing residues in nsp14 were modelled by modeller921 54 water in a dodecahedron box the edge of which was at least 12  away from the complex surface sufficient counter ions were added to neutralize the system we used the amber99sb-ildn force field 55 to simulate protein and nucleotides the force field parameters for ntp analogues were derived based on the existing amber99sb-ildn force field parameters or general amber force field 56 57 see si section 21 for details partial charges of ntp analogues were generated following the restricted electrostatic potential scheme 58 59 see si for details for atp or ntp analogues in the triphosphate form parameters for the triphosphate tail were taken from those developed by meagher et al 60  the system was gradually relaxed before the production simulation under nvt ensemble t300 k v-rescale thermostat 61 was applied with the coupling time constant of 01 ps the long-range electrostatic interactions beyond the cut-off at 12  were treated with the particle-mesh ewald method 62 lennard-jones interactions were smoothly switched off from 10  to 12  the neighbor list was updated every 10 steps an integration time step of 20 fs was used and the lincs algorithm 63 was applied to constrain all the bonds we saved the snapshots every 20 ps all simulations were performed with gromacs 50 64  the equilibrated system containing wildtype rna serves as the structural basis for modelling ntp analogue at the corresponding site to investigate their inhibitory effects the details of md simulations are in si section 22 and 23 translocation pathway of remdesivir from i3 to i4 site we used climber algorithm 35 36 to generate a pathway for the translocation of remdesivir from i3 to i4 site see si section 3 for details the pre-t and post-t conformations were constructed based on the pre-t model with remdesivir at i3 site and post-t model with remdesivir at i4 site respectively we performed a 500-step climber simulation where double stranded rna was gradually driven from the pre-t state to the post-t state by external energy in vitro assays with live sars-cov-2 virus for the determination of ec50 of ntp analogues sars-cov-2 virus named betacovhong

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic spread within china and secondarily also outside china with a basic reproductive number estimated to be from 221 to 332 and a mortality rate of around 233 in the eu and european economic area and the uk as of march 6 2020 5544 cases have been reported 423 in france including 159 deaths seven in france4
 so far several studies have described demographic clinical and biological characteristics of patients with covid-19 and radiological or pathological findings associated with covid-19 more specifically these studies have reported the most common symptoms incubation periods biological abnormalities radiographic abnormalities ct abnormalities and treatment data in addition they have described varying degrees of illness and their severity mild severe or critical they have reported proportion of complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome or case fatality rates and variables associated with these complications and death1 5 6 7 8 9

research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed central for all studies or reports presenting clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 using the terms covid-19 and clinical or 2019-ncov and clinical from database inception to feb 24 2020 no language restrictions were applied our search returned 134 publications these papers described demographic clinical and biological characteristics of patients with covid-19 and radiological or pathological findings associated with covid-19 in particular they reported most common symptoms incubation periods biological abnormalities radiographic abnormalities ct abnormalities and treatment data they also described varying degrees of illness and their severity mild severe or critical they reported proportion of complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome or case fatality rates and variables associated with these complications and death in addition these studies reported data on virus shedding they studied in particular dynamics of the viral load in sputum urine throat swab and stool samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals they also evaluated virus shedding in patients who had recovered
added value of this study
this study reports clinical data from the first patients diagnosed with covid-19 in europe the study also brings to the field some new and original findings by including patients at different stages of infection ie at very early stages or later in the course of the disease and through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy patients enrolled early being contacts of patients enrolled later during the course of the disease to our knowledge the association between clinical evolution and the virological dynamic has not been reported in the past it allowed us to describe three patterns paucisymptomatic patients diagnosed very quickly over their disease course with an early high nasopharyngeal shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset 52 and 74 log10 copies per 1000 cells respectively patients with a two-step disease progression with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples and a patient with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma ie an old patient
implications of all the available evidence
paucisymptomatic patients because of high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples might potentially transmit the disease during the very first days of symptoms despite having a mild presentation of the disease the implication is that covid-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of cases after symptom onset together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of infected patients in patients with severe disease two patterns were identified the first pattern was a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed by a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to immunopathological lesions the second pattern observed in the most severely ill patient who died was a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with a positive virus detection in other body fluids including blood these findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and in tailoring treatment strategies
 this case series is part of an overall french clinical cohort assessing patients with covid-19 nct04262921 all patients at french hospitals who were diagnosed with covid-19 according to the french national health agency criteria were enrolled in this cohort from jan 24 to jan 29 20205
 together with the french national regulatory authorities and french ministry of health on jan 25 2020 we determined the indication criteria for compassionate use of an investigational antiviral treatment remdesivir as signs of severe illness at diagnosis or secondary clinical aggravation respiratory symptoms or general signs based on who criteria for severe pneumonia caused by sars-cov-210 appendix p 2 on the basis of expert opinion and available data in january 2020 we considered that remdesivir might be the best potential drug for the treatment of covid-19 although restricted to patients with severe disease intravenous route a loading dose of 200 mg then maintenance daily dose of 100 mg for a total duration of 10 days criteria for discharge with total recovery were from european centre for disease prevention and control guidelines asymptomatic patients with two rt-pcr negative nasopharyngeal samples at least 48 h apart11

jan 26 an acute respiratory failure triggered his icu admission to bichat-claude bernard university hospital he subsequently developed multiple organ failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome acute kidney injury liver failure and sepsis-like shock after the covid-19 diagnosis was confirmed on jan 28 he was transferred to the referent icu at bichat-claude bernard hospital in paris where broad-spectrum antibacterials were started for a possible superinfection remdesivir was started with a loading dose as two pathogens were identified a susceptible acinetobacter baumannii multiplex pcr confirmed by tracheal aspirates culture and an aspergillus flavus tracheal aspirates culture the anti-infective treatment was adapted we treated a baumanii with meropenem tigecycline and colimycin followed by meropenem and levofloxacin we initially treated a flavus with voriconazole but switched to isavuconazole because voriconazole and remdesivir both contain sulphobutylether--cyclodextrin and the safety of this association has not been evaluated yet remdesivir was discontinued on jan 30 because the patient needed renal replacement therapy ct scan on jan 31 showed a bilateral pleuropneumopathy including pleural effusion alveolar condensations ground-glass opacities and pulmonary cysts on feb 5 because of the severity of the disease and persistence of viral detection and as the riskbenefit assessment was considered favourable remdesivir was reinitiated multiple organ failure persisted despite appropriate treatment against a baumannii and a flavus and no other superinfection was identified the patient died on feb 14 illness day 24 patients 4 and 5 were admitted to hospital early after the onset of the symptoms and were classified as having mild disease9 patient 4 patient 1s wife a 30-year-old chinese woman was diagnosed with covid-19 on jan 24 2020 at bichat-claude bernard university hospital illness day 2 5 days after her arrival in paris she had spent those days with patient 1 she had moderate influenza-like symptoms from jan 23 illness day 1 with no abnormalities on the chest x-ray after some days of persistent and incapacitating cough her condition improved without any specific treatment she became asymptomatic on feb 2 illness day 11 and was discharged on feb 12 patient 5 patients 3s daughter a 46-year-old chinese woman was diagnosed with covid-19 on jan 29 2020 illness day 2 she had stayed with patient 3 since their travel from china she had mild symptoms with sore throat and dry cough from jan 28 illness day 1 and a normal chest x-ray her cough which was initially mild increased transiently over time she was asymptomatic from feb 4 illness day 8 without any specific treatment and was discharged on feb 17 patients 4 and 5 had nasopharyngeal samples collected within the first 24 h of illness onset allowing an early diagnosis of covid-19 these early specimens had a high viral load enabling whole-genome virus sequencing and virus isolation table 2
 the maximal normalised viral load obtained in their respiratory specimens were at 52 log10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 4 and 74 log10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 5 based on the rdrp quantitative rtrt-pcr this viral load in respiratory samples decreased over time figure 2
 sars-cov-2 detection by rt-pcr was negative on illness day 12 for patient 4 and on illness day 16 for patient 5 figure 2 these patients also had a positive detection of sars-cov-2 in stools with viral load as high as 68 log10 copies per g of stool for patient 4 and 81 log10 copies per g of stool for patient 5 however the virus was not detected in the serum or the urine samples patient 1 had nasopharyngeal samples collected at illness day 6 and patient 2 on day 9 which were positive by rtrt-pcr with a sars-cov-2 viral load of 71 log10 copies per 1000 cells and detected but not quantifiable viral load respectively the whole-genome virus sequence was obtained by direct sequencing for patient 1 only virus isolation was unsuccessful in both cases the secondary evolution to severe disease in these two patients days 10 and 11 was not correlated to any viral load increase figure 2 both received intravenous remdesivir when the viral load had already decreased below the detection threshold during the whole course of the disease of these two patients sars-cov-2 detection by rt-pcr was negative in stools serum and urine at illness day 6 patient 3 whose disease was classified as critical was positive by rt-pcr in both a nasopharyngeal sample and bronchoalveolar lavage with cycle threshold values for the e gene target charit protocol14 of 303 and 274 and similar cycle threshold values for the house-keeping gene gapdh of 257 and 247 respectively table 2 the sars-cov-2 titres in the nasopharynx were stable from 67 to 44 log10 copies per 1000 cells over time although with a trend towards decrease after the first intravenous remdesivir dose and thereafter when remdesivir was reinitiated figure 2 this patient had a rnaaemia on illness day 8 and subsequently with a low viral load detected but below the quantification limit during the course of the disease he developed a pleural exudative effusion with sars-cov-2 detection positive in the pleural fluid and negative bacterial cultures 
figure 3
illustrates the kinetics of the viral load in nasopharyngeal samples of all patients after disease onset the viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and 14 in four patients patients 1 2 4 and 5 in the most severely ill patient patient 3 nasopharyngeal virus detection persisted until death when available the sequence analysis of the virus of these patients showed that patients 1 and 4 compared with patient 5 correspond to two distinct events of importation for patients 1 and 4 the virus was clustering with viruses from cases in wuhan shenzhen china california usa australia and taiwan whereas for patient 5 the virus was clustering with those from chongqing china and singapore the genetic epidemiology of sars-cov-2 is available online furthermore the very high degree of identity of the sequences from patients 1 and 4 supports the epidemiological link between these cases and the likelihood of transmission in this case series of five patients with covid-19 we illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution first mild cases through two paucisymptomatic patients aged younger than 50 years who were diagnosed early with high viral load in nasopharyngeal samples suggesting a significant shedding of sars-cov-2 reflected by virus detection by rt-pcr second two young patients presenting with mild symptoms at admission and experiencing a secondary progression to pneumonia and severe disease by days 1011 and third an older patient with a rapid evolution towards critical disease with multiple organ failure and a long and sustained persistence of sars-cov-2 nasopharyngeal detection associated with viral rna detection in multiple sites including blood among the five cases investigated here the two patients with mild disease were diagnosed at an early stage of the disease because they had a contact with a confirmed case high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are suggestive of potentially high risk of transmissibility during the very first days of symptoms this finding is in line with data reported by zou and colleagues who analysed viral load in the upper respiratory tract in relation to day of onset of symptoms in 17 symptomatic patients in whom higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset16 this observation suggests that the virus shedding pattern of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is different from that seen with sars-cov in which the virus load was very low at disease onset17 18 19 these findings might affect the implementation of infection control measures the implication is that covid-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of patients with the disease together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of these patients to detect those with very mild symptoms in two of five patients reported here sars-cov-2 rna was detected in stool samples this possible route of transmission must be investigated detection of viral rna does not necessarily imply that infectious particles are present and transmissible20 particularly when patients such as these two individuals have no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms in this case series except for the patient with critical disease the viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and day 14 of note the virus was also detected by rtrt-pcr at low levels in the upper respiratory tract even after full resolution of symptoms whether infectious virus might be still present despite symptom resolution will require further attempts of virus isolation this uncertainty justifies the european centre for disease prevention and control recommendation to obtain two rt-pcr negative nasopharyngeal samples before discharge of asymptomatic patients11 this conservative recommendation is however no longer feasible in many european countries that are in an epidemic situation in this case series three patients had a severe or critical disease with two different patterns the first one in patients with severe diseases patients 1 and 2 is characterised by a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed with a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples sars-cov-2 was no longer detected in the upper respiratory tract in one patient and at very low levels in the other in patients with this pattern a ct scan at the moment of the worsening showed ground-glass lung opacities in line with those reported by others in patients with covid-198 20 time to worsening of respiratory symptoms was around 10 days after disease onset in these two cases close to the median disease duration before worsening 80 days iqr 50130 previously reported by huang and collaborators6 in these patients one might postulate that the lung damage is more related to immunopathological lesions resulting from an excessive pro-inflammatory host response rather than to uncontrolled viral replication6 of note we did not assess virus load in low respiratory tract samples from these two patients the second pattern observed in the patient classified as having critical disease and who died patient 3 consists of a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with positive virus detection by rtrt-pcr in other body fluids including blood by contrast with the previous pattern this persistent high viral load suggests the ability of the sars-cov-2 to evade the immune response indeed we can speculate that as shown during middle east respiratory syndrome mers and sars coronavirus infections21 22 sars-cov-2 might be able to inhibit the interferon signalling pathways resulting in higher respiratory virus load positive viraemia and eventually poor prognosis as for mers-cov23 24 indeed the 80-year-old patient unlike the other cases had evidence of high viral replication in the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract with virus detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid the impaired immune response might have facilitated the bacterial and fungal superinfections patients with similar severe patterns sustained viral rna in the respiratory tract and detection of sars-cov-2 in the blood have also been reported in china6 as reported in previous studies12 25 severely ill patients are often older patient with comorbidities patient 3 was aged 80 years and might have had an impaired interferon pathway these different patterns and especially the fact that patients with severe or critical disease might have different viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract might be important the findings suggest that different therapeutic approaches based on viral kinetics monitoring might be needed in patients with a virus load decrease in the upper respiratory tract versus those with high viral replication and systemic virus dissemination we should be cautious when analysing these data because of the small number of patients but adapting treatment to the clinical course should be considered in future studies there is no currently validated antiviral treatment to control such sars-cov-2 infections among potential candidates remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug nucleosidic analogue family that has broad-spectrum in-vitro and in-vivo activity against numerous rna viruses including sars-cov-2 in animal models compared with lopinavir plus ritonavir combined with interferon beta two other potential candidates remdesivir more significantly reduced the virus titre of mice infected with the mers-cov and decreased the lung tissue damage26 remdesivir treatment improved disease outcomes and reduced viral loads in sars-cov-infected mice27 and is inhibitory for sars-cov-2 in vitro28 a phase 3 clinical trial assessed this drug for the treatment of ebola virus infection therefore data exist for the safety of use in humans29 hence on the basis of expert opinion we considered remdesivir use in the three patients with severe disease patterns to the best of our knowledge only one case of remdesivir use in covid-19 has been reported so far20 two randomised controlled trials are enrolling patients in china to assess the clinical benefit of this treatment nct04257656 nct04252664 on the basis of our data we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of remdesivir on covid-19 infections in two patients the drug was initiated at the time of disease worsening when the virus was already barely detectable in the clinical specimens in one of them remdesivir was discontinued after 5 days because of a combined alanine aminotransferase elevation and a rash although it could not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to remdesivir in the third patient remdesivir was discontinued after a single dose because of renal replacement therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation remdesivir contains cyclodextrin an excipient whose clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance because the patients condition was worsening and viral load was not decreasing we reinitiated remdesivir in this paper we report clinical and virological data on the first cases of covid-19 in europe although we acknowledge the fact that the results provided are based on a small number of cases a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy enabled us to illustrate the different courses of the disease we observed and provide some relevant criteria regarding the severity of disease we believe that these findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies  review of emerging pharmacotherapy for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 ashley barlow kaitlin landolf m brooke barlow siu yeung yan jason heavner j cassidy claassen w mojdeh heavner s   pharmacologic therapies against sarscov2 target its viral structure and genome figure 1 sarscov2 expresses viral proteins on its outer surface that facilitate attachment on to host cells via angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 sarscov2 is a singlestranded ribonucleic acid rna beta coronavirus that replicates by recruiting nonstructural proteins such as 3chymotrypsinlike protease papainlike protease helicase and rnadependent rna polymerase
10
 these structural components have some similarities to other known viruses such as hepatitis b hepatitis c and human immunodeficiency virus hiv prompting repurposing of currently approved antiviral therapies targeted at these viruses nucleoside analogs available for hiv and respiratory viruses may have a therapeutic role in blocking rna synthesis by targeting the rnadependent rna polymerase found in sarscov2 furthermore the currently available hiv protease inhibitors have displayed some in vitro activity against the 3chymotryspinlike protease found in sars and mers
10

 it is critical to be aware that currently available therapies have been specifically designed to target the viral genome of a certain virus and the sarscov2 physical structure may differ limiting in vivo efficacy
10
 other nonstructural or accessory proteins have a role for potential therapeutic targets in development as shown in figure 1 as opposed to directly targeting viral replication other therapeutic approaches can be aimed at modulating the innate immune system to attack the virus or inhibit cytokines that are upregulated during viral replication to dampen the physiologic response to disease
11
 
12
 practical considerations for current therapies available against sarscov2 are summarized in tables 1 and 2 and discussed at length in the following sections remdesivir gs5734 is an investigational antiviral agent undergoing phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of covid19 remdesivir was initially developed for the treatment of ebola hemorrhagic fever with trials still ongoing however it has not been approved globally for any indication
13
 in vitro and in vivo animal data suggest activity against paramyxoviridae filoviridae and the coronaviridae including merscov sarscov and sarscov2

16

 remdesivir is a 1cyanosubstituted adenosine nucleotide analog
17
 as a prodrug remdesivir is metabolized in cells and tissues to an active nucleoside triphosphate gs443902 that inhibits viral rnadependent rna polymerases early in the viral infectious cycle
18
 
19
 other potential mechanisms of this adenosine nucleotide analog may involve lethal mutagenesis and chain termination
18
 the incorporation of active nucleoside triphosphate via remdesivir at the beginning stages of replication of murine hepatitis virus in vitro had the most profound effect at 2 hours pre and postinfection with a decreasing effect greater than 4 hours postinfection suggesting a timedependent effect for drug activity
18

 nucleotide analogs are used for viral rna or dna polymerase inhibition and have demonstrated decreased viral replication with their use resistance to mutagens of other medications in vitro has resulted in exoribonuclease proofreading and removal remdesivir has shown potential to avoid this proofreading and thus removal via the exoribonuclease
18
 in vitro studies in human airway epithelial cell cultures as a lung model have found activity against coronaviruses
15
 studies assessing the potency of remdesivir were efficacious among divergent coronaviruses in human airway epithelial cells
18
 based on the existing evidence for remdesivir activity against sarscov and similar viruses remdesivir is being investigated for its use against sarscov2 in the united states remdesivir has been used for compassionate purposes for a duration of 410 days in these patients remdesivir was continued until improvement in respiratory symptoms
20

 ongoing clinical trials are studying remdesivir with a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously followed by 100 mgday intravenously for 5 to 10 days in adult patients
21
 
22
 dosing for patients weighing less than 40 kg with a 5 mgkg loading dose followed by a 25 mgkg onceday maintenance dose has been studied for the treatment of ebola
23

 the existing remdesivir pharmacokinetic data are extrapolated from in vitro human cell data and in vivo mouse and nonhuman primate data remdesivir is converted from the parent metabolite to the active metabolite a triphosphorylated nucleoside via anabolic intracellular kinase
24
 
25
 mice received remdesivir subcutaneously as 50 mgkg onceday or 25 mgkg twiceday with a decrease in plasma concentrations of the prodrug and a steady concentration of the activated drug in the lung
15
 in the murine model twiceday dosing maintained lung concentrations for a longer duration in the in vitro human lung cell model and the in vivo nonhuman primate model onceday dosing was found to reach sufficient concentrations with remdesivir demonstrating an activated nucleoside triphosphate halflife of 20 hours
19
 
26

 no data are available to date regarding remdesivir dosing in patients with renal or hepatic impairment data on clearance of remdesivir in renal replacement therapy are also not yet available important pharmacokinetic considerations will need to be elucidated given that patients receiving remdesivir are likely to be critically ill with endorgan failure
9

 reported adverse effects of remdesivir after use in three patients in the united states included nausea vomiting gastroparesis or rectal bleeding with no other reported symptoms these patients also experienced elevated aminotransferase levels occurring 15 days after initiating remdesivir
20
 however it is unclear whether this laboratory change is due to the drug itself or the virus because a third of critically ill patients with covid19 have been observed with liver dysfunction
9
 in a study using remdesivir for ebola virus in humans one patient experienced hypotension during infusion of the loading dose necessitating discontinuation that patient ultimately died due to cardiac arrest
27
 a patient experienced neurologic complications after receiving remdesivir for ebola treatment in a phase 1 study however it is not clear if this was due exclusively to having received remdesivir
19
 currently the data on remdesivir use in humans are too sparse to have a clear adverse effect profile for this agent current phase 3 randomized clinical trials will provide more conclusive insight into the adverse effects of remdesivir
21
 
22
 
28

 remdesivir is manufactured as a lyophilized powder that requires reconstitution and is administered intravenously over 30 minutes the infusion duration has also been extended over longer times to obtain higher intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite
29
 no data are available regarding compatibility of remdesivir with other intravenous medications to date drugdrug and drugnutrition interactions have not been reported chloroquine analogs chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine have been used for the prevention and treatment of malaria since the early 1900s
30
 aside from their antimalarial properties chloroquine analogs possess immunomodulatory effects lending to their utility for the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis the multimodal properties of chloroquine analogs and their minimal toxicity profile have led to their investigation in the treatment of virusinduced illness where the pathologic features are driven by an inflammatory response such as in hivassociated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
31

 chloroquine analogs are weak bases that in their nonprotonated form penetrate and concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes once present intracellularly chloroquine analogs become protonated and increase intravesicular ph resulting in prevention of endosomal trafficking dysfunctional cellular enzymes and impaired protein synthesis
30
 chloroquinemediated ph alterations have been proposed to result in early inhibition of viral replication through interference with endosomemediated viral entry or late transport of the enveloped virus this mechanism has translated to the potential role of chloroquine analogs in the treatment of covid19 and also appears to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of ace2 receptor expression that prevents sarscov2 receptor binding and subsequent spread of infection
32

 clinical data supporting the use of chloroquine analogs in the treatment of coronavirus have centered around several in vitro studies from the sarscov outbreak in the early 2000s with the use of chloroquine one group tested the cytotoxic potential of chloroquine against sarscov in an in vitro cell culture chloroquine demonstrated a potent cytotoxic response with a 99 inhibition of viral replication at day 3
33
 further in vitro models supported its cytotoxic response and observed that application of chloroquine before viral exposure resulted in favorable inhibition of viral spread suggesting its potential role as an effective prophylactic intervention
32

 hydroxychloroquine a hydroxy derivative of chloroquine with an improved safety profile has also been studied in vitro against sarscov2 with a 3fold higher cytotoxic potential compared with chloroquine
34
 one study demonstrated potent antiviral effect at both entry and postentry states at plasma concentrations of 690 m this concentration can be safely achieved in humans
35
 clinical data in humans thus far have been limited with the best available evidence to date from more than 100 patients from 10 different hospitals in china during the current covid19 outbreak this pooled analysis demonstrated superiority of chloroquine compared with control in inhibiting exacerbations of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting viral negative conversion and shortening the disease course in the absence of any adverse effects
36
 the dual mechanism of antiviral and antiinflammatory effects of chloroquine were proposed to account for its utility in preventing covid19related pneumonia ongoing trials for hydroxychloroquine are actively recruiting with hopes to further delineate its role in the treatment paradigm for covid19
37

 chloroquine is formulated as a tablet in a phosphate salt form for oral administration in the treatment of covid19 expert consensus recommends a chloroquine phosphate tablet at a dose of 500 mg orally twiceday for a duration of 10 days
38
 bioavailability after oral administration is complete 60100 and rapid within 30 minutes chloroquine is widely distributed into nearly every organ system including the eyes heart kidney liver and lungs where retention is prolonged
39
 chloroquine is metabolized into an active metabolite desethyl chloroquine via hepatic enzymes cytochrome p450 cyp 2c8 and cyp3a4 this metabolite accounts for a small portion of its pharmacologic activity chloroquine is a major substrate of cyp2d6 this enzyme accounts for 30 of its inactivation inhibitors of this enzyme should be avoided due to a heightened risk of accumulation and toxicity chloroquine is predominantly eliminated in the urine with 50 of a dose recovered unchanged no dose adjustments are needed if creatinine clearance clcr is above 10 mlminute however administration of 50 of the dose is required in patients on intermittent hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis or if clcr is below 10 mlminute patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy crrt should receive fulldose chloroquine
39

 hydroxychloroquine sulfate is available as a filmcoated tablet for oral administration dosing recommendations for covid19 are not welldefined and clinical trials and in vitro data are ongoing to assist with dose optimization current in vitro pharmacokinetic models suggest a loading dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg orally twiceday on day 1 followed by 200 mg orally twiceday for 4 days hydroxychloroquine has similar or possibly superior cytotoxic effects against sarscov2 as chloroquine 500 mg twiceday translation of the cytotoxic effects of hydroxychloroquine in vivo remains unknown
34
 a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for covid19 is actively recruiting with a planned intervention of 400 mg by mouth onceday for a total duration of 5 days
37
 the major difference in dosing strategies is the utility of a loading dose given that the terminal halflife of hydroxychloroquine is 50 days in blood and remains in the body for up to 3 months a loading dose is a reasonable approach until the clinical outcomes from ongoing trials are published hydroxychloroquine has rapid absorption after oral administration a wide volume of distribution vd and prolonged halflife metabolism and elimination of hydroxychloroquine differ from chloroquine because reliance on cyp enzymes for elimination is minimal and clearance is not correlated with renal function no renal or hepatic dose adjustments are recommended however cautious use with severe impairment is advised given the wide vd 155 lhr and high lipophilicity of the compound crrt is likely to have minimal impact on drug removal chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are generally well tolerated the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal intolerances such as nausea vomiting abdominal cramping and a metallic taste acute toxicity in the setting of supratherapeutic dosing may manifest as cardiomyopathy neuropathy or myopathy retinopathy a hallmark toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is predominantly associated with high doses longterm administration ie hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis and are unlikely of concern in the setting of covid19 treatment although the manufacturers labeling of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cautions against their use in patients with glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd deficiency only limited data support this risk and no incidence of hemolytic anemia was seen in patients with g6pd in 30 years of drug exposure
39
 
40
 both agents are safe in pregnancy with minimal risk of congenital malformations
41
 albeit rare use in patients with preexisting cardiac disease or qtc prolongation should be avoided due to the risk of torsades de pointes concurrent administration of qtc prolonging agents and strong 2d6 inhibitors chloroquine only should be avoided to minimize cardiac adverse effects notable dermatologic adverse effects can include photosensitivity lichenoid reactions and drug eruptions with chloroquine and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with hydroxychloroquine
39
 
40
 in postmarketing data case reports of hypoglycemia progressing to loss of consciousness occurred with these agents in patients with a history of diabetes on concurrent antidiabetic agents
39
 
40
 the proposed mechanism of hypoglycemia involves inhibited insulin degradation patients have required up to a 30 reduction in insulin doses with concurrent hydroxychloroquine administration
42
 baseline and routine monitoring of blood glucose and electrocardiogram for the qtc interval are recommended for patients on chloroquine analog therapy to mitigate nausea and vomiting it is recommended to administer chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with food chloroquine can be crushed and mixed with flavored syrups or enclosed in gelatin capsules to mask the bitter taste
39
 in patients who are mechanically ventilated chloroquine can be extemporaneously compounded into oral suspension hydroxychloroquine tablets should not be crushed or split at the bedside for administration but instead require removal of the film coating to be compounded extemporaneously into a solution for administration via enteral tubes neither agent is available for intravenous administration and would be an unfavorable option in patients who are not permitted to take anything by mouth or have no enteral access administration of antacids within 4 hours of chloroquine should be avoided due to a potential for chelation and reduced bioavailability this interaction is not present with hydroxychloroquine a theoretical drugdrug interaction exists between proton pump inhibitors ppis and chloroquine analogs because the blockage of h k atpase by ppis in lysosomes can raise the ph and reduce drug accumulation that could weaken immunomodulatory effects however effects of this interaction in vivo are unknown

 lopinavir lpv is an aspartic acid protease inhibitor developed for the treatment of hiv lopinavir is coformulated with ritonavir lpvr to boost the pharmacokinetic activity and halflife of lpv through inhibition of cyp450 lpvr provides potent and sustained viral load reductions for patients with hiv which has prompted interest in assessing its efficacy in other viruses that function with similar machinery
43

 proteases are essential enzymes for the production and maturation of viral genomes the primary antiviral effect of protease inhibitors is prevention of viral replication thus limiting spread into host cells
43
 the therapeutic rationale for lpvr arises from in vitro studies demonstrating inhibition of the 3chymotrypsinlike protease found in novel coronaviruses
44
 
45
 however lpv was specifically designed to match the structure of the c2 catalytic site within the hiv aspartic acid protease sarscov2 protease is a cysteine protease family and structurally dissimilar because it lacks a c2 catalytic site
10

 the therapeutic value of lpvr emerged from in vitro studies testing its utility for sars and mers in vitro testing of lpvr was performed for severe merscov in marmosets lopinavirritonavir improved clinical scores for weight loss and symptom burden improved radiologic clearance and decreased viral loads in necroscopied lungs
45
 the benefit of lpvr has yet to be clearly replicated in human cell cultures with some studies showing complete lack of in vitro activity
46
 clinical in vivo studies from sars and mers outbreaks demonstrated that the use of lpvr 400100 mg by mouth twiceday combined with ribavirin with or without corticosteroids initiated during the early phase of viral acquisition reduced rates of ards or death when compared with a matched cohort that received supportive care or ribavirin alone
44
 
47
 
48
 however these findings did not remain significant if lpvr was initiated later in the disease course reiterating the lack of pharmacologic effect against a viral genome that has been integrated into host dna
48

 available literature to date for lpvr in the treatment of covid19 stems from a descriptive case series of five patients in singapore receiving lpvr 200100 mg twiceday for 14 days three patients had reductions in ventilation requirements within 3 days of treatment initiation but two had progressive respiratory failure despite the lower dosing regimen compared with previous studies four of the five patients had premature treatment discontinuation secondary to nausea vomiting diarrhea and increased liver function tests no deaths occurred in the study but efficacy outcomes are difficult to interpret based on the lower dosing strategy compared with previous data this does raise concerns about the potential tolerability of the higher dose regimen
49

 another retrospective cohort showed that lpvr has limited influence on the duration of viral shedding that can occur for a median of 20 days after initially contracting the virus
49
 
50
 in a recent randomized controlled openlabel trial including hospitalized patients with sarscov2 infection patients receiving lpvr 400100 mg twiceday for 14 days versus standard of care found no benefit versus standard of care treatment
51
 multiple ongoing studies have evaluated the clinical utility of lpvr as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies such as ribavirin and interferon ifn
52
 
53
 
54

 lopinavirritonavir is available as a singletablet formulation kaletra in dosage strengths of 400100 mg or 200100 mg given the largest available evidence from in vitro studies if lpvr is used as an adjunctive agent for covid19 a dose of 400 mg100 mg by mouth twiceday for 14 days is recommended the drug is highly protein bound 98 and its primary pathway for elimination is through the hepatobiliary system no dose adjustments are required for renal impairment in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis however onceday dosing is not recommended when indicated for treatment of hiv this does not influence use in covid19 because the recommended schedule is twiceday
43
 no dosage adjustments are recommended in hepatic impairment but caution should be advised if used in patients with advanced liver disease
55
 lower dosages of 200100 mg twiceday can be considered where adverse effects limit tolerability with the understanding that lower doses may not substantially mitigate toxicities based on information collected by the antiretroviral pregnancy registry an increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been observed in humans the health and human services perinatal hiv guidelines consider lpvr a therapeutic option for pregnant women living with hiv and can be continued if conception occurs during therapy
56

 the considerable potential for drugdrug interactions with lpvr requires a thorough review of concomitant medications ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of cyp3a4 a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism and elimination of many medications in addition ritonavir is a moderate inhibitor of pglycoprotein pgp organic anion transporter oatp1b1 oatp1b3 and is an inducer of udpglucuronosyltransferase
55
 patients requiring icu admission for covid19 are often elderly with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy the potential therapeutic benefit of lpvr should be weighed against considerable interactions with commonly used medications in the icu eg midazolam fentanyl antiarrhythmics
3

 treatment with lpvr may result in intolerable gastrointestinal toxicities although administration with food may ameliorate the severity of these symptoms up to 24 of patients experience diarrhea although it usually improves within 2 weeks
55
 adverse events particularly relevant to icu patients include potentially fatal pancreatitis hepatitis hepatic decompensation among those with preexisting liver disease and increased pr intervals especially in those with congenital qtc prolongation
55

 previous studies using lpvr for sars demonstrated increased serum amylase and liver enzyme elevations compared with a matched cohort routine monitoring of liver function tests is critical and supportive care with antiemetics and antimotility agents should be considered
44
 cardiovascular and metabolic toxicities such as lipid abnormalities are commonly observed in patients with hiv receiving these therapies for prolonged periods these are less likely when used for the abbreviated durations for covid19 lopinavirritonavir tablets should not be chewed or crushed for patients unable to swallow
55
 in patients who are intubated or have limited oral access an oral suspension is available for delivery via a nasogastric tube
55
 of note the suspension does contain 424 ethanol available data suggest administration with enteral nutrition does not adversely impact drug concentrations
57
 coadministration with food that contains a moderate to high fat content can enhance lpvr bioavailability
55

 ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analog that elicits its antiviral affect through inhibition of viral rna synthesis ribavirin is a prodrug that undergoes metabolic conversion by the liver after which its metabolic structure closely mimics the purine analog guanosine that enhances its incorporation into rna the structural elements prohibit the subsequent addition of nucleoside analogs effectively halting the synthesis of rna
58
 ribonucleic acid is ubiquitous in many viruses which is why ribavirin has been studied in a broad range of viral diseases including hepatitis b c and respiratory syncytial virus
59

 the nonselective antiviral properties of ribavirin prompted investigators to evaluate its use during the sars and mers outbreaks during the initial sars outbreak ribavirin was used throughout hong kong in both oral and intravenous formulations
60
 however the distribution of the intravenous formulation which is not available in all countries including the united states was restricted in the midst of the epidemic given the concern for lack of in vitro susceptibility and considerable toxicity in 126 patients treated with ribavirin hemolysis and anemia occurred in up to 76 and 49 of cases respectively
61
 
62
 in vivo data suggest serum concentrations of ribavirin needed to blunt viral replication effectively is higher than what is safely achievable in humans
61
 in vitro data suggest rapid resistance against sars and mers when used as a monotherapy but potential activity when combined with other antivirals such as lpvr or chloroquine analogs
38
 
63
 outcomes for ribavirin use in combination with interferon ifn2a for merscov is discussed in the ifn section ribavirin is commercially available as an oral capsule oral solution and inhaled formulation
59
 the inhaled formulation has not been studied for sars mers or covid19 and the intravenous form is not available in the united states oral ribavirin has been dosed as a 4g loading dose followed by 12 g every 8 hours in two small studies for sars
44
 
64
 in the management of covid19 data are limited to ongoing studies using a dosing strategy of 400 mg by mouth twiceday for 14 days as a part of a combination regimen ribavirin has a prolonged halflife of 40 days loading doses may aid in achieving steady state more rapidly
65
 ribavirin is metabolized to its active form via extrahepatic enzymes
59
 however its use in hepatic impairment childpugh class b and c is not recommended given that it is metabolized by cyp enzyme pathways ribavirin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion requiring strict dose reductions for renal insufficiency that varies based on indication
59
 a review on the use of ribavirin in sars recommended a 50 dose reduction for clcr between 30 and 50 mlminute and a 75 reduction for cl of below 30 mlminute
65
 there is no established safety of ribavirin in patients receiving renal replacement therapy it should be restricted to those with stable renal function ribavirin carries a boxed warning for hemolytic anemia
59
 in a study assessing the adverse effects associated with the use of ribavirin use for sars the most common adverse effects were hemolytic anemia 61 hypocalcemia 58 and hypomagnesemia 46
66
 the onset of hemolytic anemia occurs as early as 35 days after therapy with high doses above 12 g that were used as loading doses for coronavirus
44
 
67
 the risk is highest in patients who are elderly or have poor renal function but consideration should also be taken in patients with preexisting cardiac disease where reduction in hemoglobin increases the risk of decompensation
59
 ribavirin is a teratogen with a significant potential for embryonic toxicity and contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in male partners of women who are pregnant if ribavirin is considered in women or men of childbearing potential use of systemic and barrier contraception must be strictly enforced because active metabolites of ribavirin persist in plasma for up to 6 months contraception is required both during treatment and for at least 6 months after treatment is completed
59

 ribavirin does not have drugdrug interactions because its metabolism and elimination does not rely on the cypp450 system however certain therapies should be used cautiously with ribavirin due to the potential for enhanced toxicities ribavirin in combination with other immunosuppressive therapies particularly azathioprine or ifn can lead to severe pancytopenia
59

 ribavirin administered orally as a solution or capsule has an absolute bioavailability of 4050 compared with the intravenous or as an aerosol formulation
59
 oral formulations have enhanced bioavailability when taken with a highfat meal and it is recommended to administer both oral formulations with food due to the teratogenic potential of ribavirin it was identified as a hazardous medication on the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh list and requires significant safety precautions with its use the capsules should not be opened crushed or broken
59
 health care providers handling ribavirin must also follow niosh recommendations to wear gloves when packaging administering or receiving intact capsules when handling the solution double gloving a protective gown and eyeface protection is required especially for administration of the oral liquid through a feeding tube nitazoxanide is a 2acetyloxyn5nitro2thiazolyl benzamide with an approved food and drug administration fda indication for its antiprotozoal activity to treat diarrhea caused by giardia parvum and giardia lamblia
68
 nitazoxanide has since been found to have activity against cryptosporidium and in vitro activity against anaerobic grampositive and gramnegative bacteria
69
 
70
 another studied use of nitazoxanide was for the treatment of influenza
71
 when nitazoxanide was studied for severe acute respiratory illness no benefit was seen in clinical outcomes specifically length of hospital stays
72

 nitazoxanide interferes with pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzymedependent electron transfer thus impairing anaerobic energy metabolism of protozoa
68
 nitazoxanide is metabolized to its active circulating metabolite tizoxanide
73
 tizoxanide selectively blocks the posttranslational influenza viral hemagglutinin maturation and intracellular movement in addition to blocking protein implantation into the plasma membrane
74
 nitazoxanide may potentiate the production of type 1 ifns produced by host cell fibroblasts that may potentiate antiviral activity via hemagglutinin inhibition
75

 nitazoxanide has demonstrated in vitro activity against merscov
71
 an anticoronavirus effect was observed with nitazoxanide in an in vitro screen of small molecules against a recombinant murine coronavirus
76
 in vitro studies of canine coronavirus found that the use of nitazoxanide inhibited viral replication
71
 based on this in vitro animal data it is thought that nitazoxanide may have activity against sarscov2 human data are limited regarding the efficacy of nitazoxanide against human coronavirus in a 260patient doubleblind placebocontrolled trial in patients with influenzalike illness five participants who received nitazoxanide were coronavirus positive
72
 subgroup analysis of these five coronaviruspositive patients found no difference in the primary outcome of days of hospitalization p061 the recommended nitazoxanide dosing for cryptosporidium parvum or g lamblia is 500 mg oral suspension or tablet every 12 hours for 3 days
68
 the dosing used for acute respiratory illness was twiceday for 5 days and dose strength was based on age patients 12 years of age and older received two 300mg tablets children 411 years old received 200 mg of the suspension and toddlers 13 years old received 100 mg of the suspension
72

 it is recommended that nitazoxanide be administered with food because pharmacokinetic studies found increased area under the curve auc and maximum concentration cmax of tizoxanide
68
 specifically a doubling of auc and 50 increase of cmax was observed when the tablet was administered with food when the suspension was administered with food there was a 4550 increase in auc and up to a 10 increase in cmax an important consideration is that the oral suspension is not bioequivalent to the tablet the suspension has a bioavailability of 70 necessitating dose adjustments when transitioning between these dosage forms
68
 in plasma tizoxanide is more than 99 bound to proteins metabolism of nitazoxanide to tizoxanide occurs via hydrolysis and then conjugation via glucuronidation nitazoxanide has not been studied in patients with impaired renal and hepatic function and no dosage adjustment recommendations exist
68
 data in geriatric and pediatric populations are not available the most common adverse effects of nitazoxanide are gastrointestinal mainly abdominal pain nausea and headache patients may also experience discoloration of eyes and urine diarrhea dizziness gastroesophageal reflux disease skin rash or urticaria compared with patients receiving standard of care and placebo patients receiving nitazoxanide did not have additional adverse effects and both groups of patients experienced gastrointestinal and respiratory effects
72
 headache and diarrhea were reported most in patients receiving placebo versus lowdose nitazoxanide versus highdose nitazoxanide for treatment of viral respiratory infection with no significant difference among all three groups
77

 nitazoxanide is available in dosage forms administered enterally including a controlledrelease filmcoated tablet and oral suspension nitazoxanide tablets can be crushed and mixed with food there are no existing data regarding the absorption of nitazoxanide when administered via gastric feeding tubes however if gastric feeding tube administration is needed the oral suspension can be used drugdrug interactions with nitazoxanide are not attributed to cytochrome cyp enzymes because in vitro metabolism data found no significant effect of tizoxanide on these enzyme pathways
68
 most notably nitazoxanide may have binding site competition with other highly proteinbound drugs a narrow therapeutic index drug that would be of concern in this case is warfarin however a pharmacokinetic study in which patients received nitazoxanide twiceday for 6 days with a onetime warfarin 25 mg dose compared with patients receiving warfarin did not result in pharmacokinetic or dynamic changes and was well tolerated
78

 nelfinavir is a hiv1 protease inhibitor originally developed for use in combination with antivirals that target hiv via alternative mechanisms with development of newer combination antivirals for hiv nelfinavir has fallen out of favor for this indication
79

 nelfinavir binds to the site of hiv1 protease activity and inhibits cleavage of viral gagpol polyprotein precursors into functional proteins that are needed for hiv what remains are nonviable hiv particles that are no longer infectious during the 2002 sars outbreak nelfinavir was identified as a potential agent with activity against sarscov based on in vitro studies
80
 nelfinavir was found to inhibit the replication of sarscov in vero e6 cells originating from the african green monkey most recently nelfinavir was identified via homology models based on threedimensional sars structures specifically at the main protease or chymotrypsinlike protease
81
 these models assessed the ability of small molecule drugs to dock to the sars structures the sarscov was used because its sequence is 96 similar to that of sarscov2 of 30 drugs assessed nelfinavir was found to have the most promising activity against sarscov2 nelfinavir has not been studied in humans for its efficacy against sarscov or sarscov2 the recommended dosing of nelfinavir for the treatment of hiv is 750 mg by mouth 3 timesday or 1250 mg by mouth twiceday the halflife of nelfinavir is 355 hours the effective dose for treatment of covid19 is unknown nelfinavir dosage adjustments do not need to be made with renal impairment because less than 2 of nelfinavir is excreted in the urine
82
 for patients with hepatic impairment nelfinavir is not recommended in patients with childpugh class b or c
79
 
83
 
84
 pharmacokinetics in patients using nelfinavir with chronic liver disease may be unpredictable
85
 no dosage adjustments are recommended for use in patients with childpugh class a impairment nelfinavir is metabolized by cyp3a4 and cyp2c19 and could potentially interact with medications that are inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes in vitro data found that only cyp3a enzymes were inhibited by nelfinavir at therapeutic concentrations
82

 the major adverse effect of nelfinavir is gastrointestinal intolerance primarily diarrhea nausea and flatulence a nonspecific rash may also occur the incidence of other side effects are minimal occurring less than 2 of the time in phase 2 and 3 trials
82

 nelfinavir is available in a tablet dosage form the 250mg tablets can be dissolved in water and readily dissolve for patients with a gastric tube as enteral access nelfinavir can be crushed dissolved in water and administered via gastric tube after dissolving nelfinavir should be taken or administered immediately notably nelfinavir may have a bitter taste if mixed with acidic food or juice
82

 absorption of nelfinavir was found to result in less pharmacokinetic variability and higher nelfinavir levels when taken with food nelfinavir has a volume of distribution of 27 lkg and is highly protein bound more than 98
82

 interferons are endogenous signaling proteins released by host cells during response to infections or inflammation upregulation of ifns stimulates the immune system to blunt viral replication and eradicate offending pathogens
86
 two ifns mediate host immune responses  and  interferon elicits a potent hostmediated immune cell response that has generated interest in the treatment of viral diseases such as hepatitis b and c and various cancers such as melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia interferon has been primarily used in the treatment of the autoimmune condition multiple sclerosis
87
 these nonspecific immunomodulatory effects have gained attraction by investigators for other viral illnesses including covid19 during the 2002 sars outbreak it was observed that after viral inoculation sarscov was able to effectively evade upregulation of ifns in human macrophages this allowed for continued viral replication due to suppression of the innate immune response
87
 two ifn products are available  and  it is currently unknown whether both products would influence coronavirus disease expression interferon has the most studies related to its use thus far human data for the use of ifn for novel coronaviruses are sparse during the sars outbreak pegylated ifn was assessed in an in vitro analysis of macaque cells at different periods of sars exposure
88
 when used before sars inoculation ifn reduced viral replication and excretion however these results were not observed postsars exposure
88
 an in vitro analysis assessing ifn as monotherapy for mers demonstrated the serum concentrations required to effectively inhibit viral replication were higher than what can be safely achieved in humans
63
 nevertheless in vitro isolates of ifn or  as a multimodal regimen with ribavirin for sars displayed potent synergy against the virus
89
 
90
 in vivo studies have yet to be able to replica the same benefits with some studies showing no influence on the disease course for mers whereas others suggest a small improvement in survival at 14 days but not 28 days when used in combination with ribavirin
91
 
92
 these viruses may display different in vitro and in vivo susceptibilities than the current sarscov2 extrapolation to the current covid19 pandemic is difficult this has not dampened the potential application of this therapy and investigators await the results of ongoing studies assessing the efficacy of ifn2b as a part of combination therapy with ribavirin for covid19 to further elucidate any benefit from ifn treatment
93
 
94

 interferon2b also comes as a pegylated form to prolong its halflife from 46 hours to 2260 hours permitting a lower dosing frequency
87
 due to the lack of established human data with ifns for covid19 this therapy should only be considered for covid19 as a part of a clinical trial there is no established dosing regimen for ifn in the treatment of covid19 the only in vivo data are with ifn2a for the treatment of mers using a dose of 180 g per week for 2 weeks similar to hepatitis b virus
92
 there is no established dosing regimen for ifn in the treatment of covid19 the only study currently recruiting at the time of this publication is using ifn1b at a dose of 025 mg 8 million iu on day 1 3 and 5 in combination with other therapies ribavirin lpvr
93
 additional studies evaluating ifn1b are evaluating its utility as an inhaled therapy
94

 if used as a part of a trial there are key clinical considerations to consider for safe use the drug labeling provides a cautionary statement for use in childpugh class b or c
87
 renal elimination accounts for 30 of total clearance dose reductions required for patients with a clcr below 50 mlminute when ifn is used in combination with ribavirin for hepatitis c
87
 given that these agents are both under investigation for covid19 if used as a part of combination therapy the same precaution should be considered interferon therapies have an increased risk of adverse effects when used during renal replacement therapy thus caution is recommended in this population
95
 
96

 interferon does not pose a risk of drugdrug interactions through cyp enzyme pathways concomitant medications that enhance the myelosuppressive or hepatotoxic effects of ifn should be used sparingly
87

 interferons are associated with significant adverse reactions even when used as a shortterm therapy injection site reactions resulting in flulike symptoms fever myalgias and headaches occur within the first 28 hours after administration rotation of injection sites application of ice before and after application and premedication with acetaminophen can mitigate these reactions additional adverse reactions include leukopenia lymphopenia autoimmune hepatitis and thyroid disease patients exposed to ifns for currently approved indications can develop neutralizing antibodies that reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this agent the development of neuropsychiatric adverse effects is not expected to occur with shortterm use
97
 the safety of ifn in pregnancy has not been established
87

 interferon is available in injectable and inhaled formulations the current study is enrolling patients using 1b injected subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh
93

 baricitinib is a janus kinase jak inhibitor originally developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis it is approved by the fda for moderate or severe active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have not responded to one or more tumor necrosis factor antagonists baricitinib reversibly and selectively inhibits jak1 and jak2 with less inhibition of jak3 and tyrosine kinase inhibition of jak results in inability of signal transmission from cytokine or growth receptors resulting in decreased hematopoiesis and immune cell function
98
 this inhibition of signal transmission prevents phosphorylation and thus activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription baricitinib has a high affinity for associated protein kinase 1 aak1 binding and could prevent the intracellular passage of viral cells and development of viral particles
99

 covid19 may result in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh as a result of viral infection
100
 patients with covid19 have exhibited ferritin and inflammatory marker elevations similar to shlh including elevated interleukin il2 il7 granulocyte stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor tnf evaluation of risk factors for mortality of covid19 cases in wuhan found ferritin and il6 levels to be higher in those who ultimately died versus survivors p0001
101
 considering the potential for increased lung injury with corticosteroid use in patients with covid19 and reported use of tocilizumab for covid19 jakstat inhibitors were theorized to have an effect on the hyperinflammatory state that occurs in covid19 baricitinib may also prevent endocytosis and viral infection by inhibiting aak1 activity baricitinib has not been studied in humans for covid19 baricitinib is typically dosed as 2 mgday by mouth for rheumatoid arthritis
98
 no data exist for treatment of covid19 however it is proposed that a 7 to 14day course would be needed
102
 dose adjustments are recommended for patients with lymphopenia neutropenia and anemia
98
 it is recommended to hold baricitinib in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cellsmm2 an absolute neutrophil count less than 1000 cellsmm2 and hemoglobin less than 8 gdl in patients with hepatic impairment baricitinib is not recommended dose adjustments are recommended with renal impairment for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr less than 30 mlminute173 m2 it is recommended to hold baricitinib for patients with an egfr 3060 mlminute173 m2 it is recommended to decrease dose to 1 mg onceday there are no dosing recommendations for patients requiring crrt baricitinib reaches peak concentrations within 1 hour of oral administration with steady state achieved at 23 days
98
 baricitinib has an oral bioavailability of 80 and is not significantly impacted by taking with or without food the baricitinib volume of distribution is 76 l it is 50 bound to plasma proteins and 45 bound to serum proteins it is a substrate of pgp breast cancer resistance protein oat and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein transporters metabolism of baricitinib occurs mainly by cyp3a4 and elimination is 75 renal relevant drugdrug interactions with baricitinib include strong oat 3 inhibitors that may increase baricitinib exposure
98
 for patients concomitantly taking strong oat 3 inhibitors the recommended dose of baricitinib is 1 mg onceday several boxed warnings exist for baricitinib including risk of infection particularly upper respiratory tract infection malignancy and thrombosis
98
 of note these side effects were higher in patients receiving the 4mg dose of baricitinib that is not a recommended dose due to these safety concerns patients in clinical trials also experienced increased incidence of neutropenia platelet elevations aminotransferase elevations lipid elevations creatinine elevations creatine phosphokinase elevations and nausea monitoring for longterm treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is recommended with baseline complete blood counts including neutrophils liver function tests and lipids
98
 monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection while treating with baricitinib is recommended in addition to skin examinations in patients at an increased risk for skin cancer baricitinib is available as a filmcoated immediaterelease tablet for enteral administration
98
 it can be given with or without consideration of food no data are available regarding crushing baricitinib and administration via gastric feeding tubes although baricitinib is not on the niosh list of medications it is carcinogenic by virtue of the adverse effect profile and it may be treated as a hazardous drug tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody with fda approval for chimeric antigen receptor cart cellinduced cytokine release syndrome crs giant cell arteritis rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis
103

 evolving data suggest patients with severe covid19 experience significant lung injury secondary to a surge of inflammatory cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm viral replication activates the innate immune system to secrete various signaling proteins such as ils that results in hyperinflammation and further lung damage interleukin6 is a key inflammatory protein involved in this pathway
100
 tocilizumab binds to il6 receptors thereby blunting cell signaling and effectively downregulating the excess inflammatory response
103

 the rationale for use of tocilizumab in covid19 stems from data discovered with sars and mers the sars patients were noted to have crs as a result of proinflammatory marker release including il6 and tnf
104
 patients with mers were discovered to have elevations of il6 il8 and il1
105
 the data from wuhan in critically ill patients with covid19 have also found increased levels of cytokines including il6 and granulocytecolony stimulating factor
8
 
106
lung tissue obtained postmortem from a patient with covid19 showed elevated inflammatory factors suggestive of a cytokine storm
107
 interleukin6 may be a key driver of the robust inflammatory response within the lungs of icu patients with covid19 recently published data from wuhan indicate that tocilizumab added to lopinavir methylprednisolone and oxygen therapy in 20 patients with severe covid19 resulted in rapid reductions in fever in all patients improvement in oxygenation for 75 and facilitated discharged from the hospital in 95 of patients
108
 additional studies are underway with tocilizumab combined with other antivirals or compared against renal replacement therapy for management of crs associated with covid19
109
 
110
 sarilumab another antiil6 antibody is currently under evaluation for the treatment of covid19 it will be studied against supportive care measures and provide enhanced insight into the utility of targeting this pathway
111

 tocilizumab for most indications is weight based with a maximum dose of 800 mg the dosing of tocilizumab for covid19 is not well established when used in a case series of patients with covid19 a onetime dose of intravenous tocilizumab 400 mg was administered
108
 
112
 for crs secondary to chimeric antigen receptor car tcell therapy three additional doses of tocilizumab can be given with at least 8 hours between each dose in the covid19 reports three patients received an additional dose of tocilizumab 12 hours later as a result of continued fevers
108

 tocilizumab auc varies based on body weight and the vd of intravenous tocilizumab at steady state is 64 l
103
 there are no published data regarding the use of tocilizumab 400 mg in obese patients with covid19 and whether the 400mg dose is adequate the halflife of tocilizumab is concentration dependent at 11 days when dosed 4 mgkg and 13 days when dosed 8 mgkg tocilizumab should be held when the absolute neutrophil count is 1000 cellsmm2 or below platelet count is 100000 cellsmm2 or below or liver enzymes are more than 35 times the upper limit of normal this is particularly relevant for the treatment of covid19 that was demonstrated to elevate liver enzymes in severe cases
113
 tocilizumab elimination is not influenced by renal dysfunction no dose adjustments are required in patients receiving tocilizumab for covid19 only one patient had a history of chronic kidney disease and no patients had reported hepatic impairment
108

 limited efficacy data with tocilizumab should be weighed against its significant cost and potential for toxicities secondary to interference with the host immune response infections ranging from bacterial viral and fungal sources may develop
103
 patients should be screened for active or latent tuberculosis infection before administering tocilizumab gastrointestinal perforation after the use of tocilizumab was reported in patients with a history of diverticulitis or receiving highdose corticosteroids
103
 infusion reactions causing hypertension headache and skin reactions within 24 hours of administration were reported after administration of tocilizumab
103

 tocilizumab is recommended to be administered intravenously over 1 hour
103
 
112
 tocilizumab should not be administered in the same line with other medications because it has not been studied for compatibility
103

 pertinent drugdrug interactions with tocilizumab may occur as a result of increased cyp450 enzyme activity in vitro studies reported that tocilizumab may increase cyp1a2 cyp2b6 cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 activity in vivo studies reported that tocilizumab may interact with simvastatin via increased activity of cyp3a4 resulting in decreased simvastatin exposure findings were also similar when omeprazole and tocilizumab were combined resulting in decreased omeprazole auc through increased cyp19 activity passive immunity delivered as anticoronavirus antibodies from convalescent human plasma may offer a novel therapeutic approach for covid19 the proposed mechanism of benefit from convalescent human plasma derived from survivors of the coronavirus is the transfer of passive immunity in an effort to restore the immune system during critical illness and neutralize the virus to suppress viremia
114
 the main driver for the investigation of convalescent human blood products in the treatment of covid19 originated from its use in the h1n1 pandemic during which patients derived a clinically significant mortality benefit and improved viral clearance from convalescent blood products
115

 in a retrospective review of 40 patients with sars who failed treatment with methylprednisolone and ribavirin at 3 days 74 19 of patients who received convalescent plasma were discharged by day 22 compared with only 19 21 of patients who received highdose corticosteroids p0001 five deaths were reported in the steroid group compared with no deaths with convalescent plasma to obtain the greatest benefit from convalescent plasma treatment should be used early in the course of disease before day 16 because viremia from sars was shown to peak in the first week of treatment followed by a primary immune response by days 10 to 14
116
 preliminary data from ongoing convalescent plasma therapy data in the covid19 outbreak suggest improvement in clinical symptoms with no signal of adverse effects
117

 targeted antisarscov2 antibodies that allow for a more selective therapy against coronavirus are in development and some companies have begun active recruitment for investigation into its clinical efficacy and safety treatment of covid19
118
 takeda pharmaceutical has announced investigation into a new plasmaderived therapy coined tak888 this plasmaderived therapy involves removing plasma from covid19 survivors extracting coronavirusspecific antibodies to administer to infected patients to stimulate a potent immune response against sarscov2 convalescent therapy remains in the experimental phase but appears it may favorably influence the treatment course and enrollment of patients into a clinical trial will aid in defining its role in therapy given lack of efficacy and risk of delayed viral clearance the world health organization consensus document on the management of covid19 strongly recommends against the use of corticosteroids unless alternative indications are present acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome secondary to systemic inflammation are wellcharacterized sequelae of sars and mers outbreaks with pulmonary histology demonstrating evidence of inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage
119
 corticosteroids were proposed to be of benefit in suppression of lung inflammation in mers and sars due to their immunomodulatory properties however clinical data are now clear that patients derive no benefit from corticosteroids in the management of sars mers or covid19 but have instead demonstrated evidence of increased risk of harm including prolonged mechanical ventilation avascular necrosis delayed viral clearance and secondary infections
120
 
121

 a retrospective observational study of critically ill patients with mers who received hydrocortisone 300 mg per day did not find a 90day mortality benefit adjusted odds ratio 08 95 confidence interval ci 0511 p012 but did find delayed viral clearance adjusted hr 04 95 ci 0207 p00005
122
 the lack of survival benefit was further supported by a systematic review of corticosteroids in patients with sars but showed an increased risk of psychosis avascular necrosis prolonged viremia and hyperglycemia with corticosteroid treatment
120
 although severe potentially lifethreatening ards can occur generalizing the evidence for corticosteroids to the covid19associated ards is problematic and fails to account for the differing pathogenesis of viralinduced lung injury
121

 corticosteroids should only be considered if required for an alternative indication ie septic shock bronchoconstriction despite the lack of benefit defined in previous trials a clinical trial is actively recruiting to assess the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone 1 mgkgday for a duration of 7 days in noncritically ill patients to further identify the risks and benefits of therapy
123

 in addition to the drug therapies previously discussed several additional drugs are being evaluated as potential therapies for covid19 in clinical trials arbidol a drug used in russia and china for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and respiratory viral infections works by blocking viral fusion to the target cell membrane and has demonstrated activity against several viruses including sars
124
 arbidol is currently being evaluated for the treatment of covid19 in several studies in china and is currently a recommended treatment option for covid19 there arbidol is not available in the united states favipiravir a drug licensed in japan for the treatment of influenza is another potential agent due to its activity against a wide spectrum of rna viruses including coronaviruses
125
 several studies are underway evaluating favipiravir for the treatment of covid19 other antiviral agents being evaluated in china for the treatment of covid19 include antiretroviral agents darunavircobicistat and emtricitabinetenofovir alafenamide as well as the influenza drug baloxavir finally oseltamivir a neuraminidase inhibitor used for treatment of influenza is also being studied for treatment of covid19 however oseltamivir is unlikely to be active against sarscov2 based on previous studies with sarscov
61

 drugs to decrease the inflammation associated with covid19 are also being evaluated one of these drugs is thalidomide that may decrease inflammation through its antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects
126

 the covid19 pandemic has presented an enormous global health crisis the pharmaceutical industry is working to develop novel treatments targeted at sarscov2 in the meantime the medical community is trialing a variety of therapies that target different antiviral and immunomodulating mechanisms to combat this virus some of the drugs are investigational and some are old drugs being repurposed for a new pathogen as we gain more information both about the effectiveness of the drugs against sarscov2 and their pharmacokinetics especially in the complex setting of critical illness we will be better equipped to optimize therapeutic strategies  repurposing of drugs for covid-19 a systematic review and meta-analysis pinky kotecha bsc  light alexander enrico checcucci daniele amparore cristian fiori francesco porpiglia  prokar dasgupta oussama elhage peter gorer  the aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the data currently available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for covid-19 treatment participants with suspected or diagnosed covid-19 will be included the interventions being considered are drugs being repurposed and comparators will include standard of care treatment or

chloroquine cq had a 100 discharge rate compared to 50 with lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14 however a trial has recommended against a high dosage due to cardiotoxic events hydroxychloroquine hcq has

permission  difference compared to the control group p0001 lopinavir-ritonavir has shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement which is seen in our meta-analyses p01 remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power discussion due to the paucity in evidence it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of covid-19 as currently there is no significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings a risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 introduction starting in december 2019 there was a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause in wuhan hubei province of china 17 the origin of the virus is unknown but there is an epidemiological link the huanan seafood wholesale market where there was a sale of wild animals such as bats 17  after notification of the world health organisation who on 31 december 2019 scientists were able to isolate a 2019-ncov from a patient and subsequently perform genome sequencing by the 7 th of january since then many cases have emerged internationally leading to the who declaring the novel 2019-ncov covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic 18  similar clinical features to previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted including presentations with fever dry cough and dyspnoea but very few presentations with prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms such as rhinorrhoea sneezing or sore throat 19  on imaging bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography ct scans have been noted the patients with severe illness developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and required intensive care unit icu admission and oxygen therapy these features bear resemblances with the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections however covid-19 patients rarely develop intestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea which was present in about 20-25 of those with sars-cov and mers-cov the mortality rate has been similarly described by cohorts 19 20 21 22 as 4-15 with many describing the memories of the novel coronavirus outbreak in china sars-cov in 2003 17 drugs used during sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are being considered 19  with no current universally agreed treatment for covid-19 the current care advised is for supportive management depending on patients needs including antipyretics for fever and oxygen therapy the repurposing of drugs can provide an avenue to find treatment options for covid-19 which has currently infected over 32 million people as of 2 may 2020 reported by the who 23 hydroxychloroquine hcq and chloroquine cq both anti-malarial drugs have been authorised by both us and french authorities as there is no adequate approved and available alternative to treat covid-19 24  these drugs have been shown to have potent anti-viral activity against covid-19 in in-vitro studies 25 26  both can have adverse effects with hcq a derivative of cq being less toxic when used long term therefore recently high-dosage of cq 12g with either azithromycin and oseltamir has not been recommended in patients with severe covid-19 due to safety issues 27  the use of anti-virals has also been trialled as previously screening of approved drugs identified anti-virals to have an inhibitory activity on sars-cov lopinavir an anti-viral also has activity against mers-cov both in vitro and in animal models 14  therefore due to the homogeneity of sars-cov-2 compared to the mentioned zoonotic viruses anti-virals which have previously been used are being repurposed remdesivir has also demonstrated effective control of covid-19 in-vitro 26 and has since been authorised for emergency use by the food and drug administration fda 28 the aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the data currently available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for covid-19 treatment this systematic review adheres to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines 29 we searched

examined the effects of cq 1 compared it to anti-viral treatment and 1 was a case series used in a news briefing 1 study analysed both clinical recovery and viral clearance cq was initially mentioned in a news briefing 3 with results from more than 100 patients which had showed it was superior to the control treatment in shortening the disease course as well as inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings and promoting a virus negative conversion subsequently huang et al 5 compared it to another proposed therapy lpv-r in a cohort study with 10 patients in the cq arm and 12 patients in the lopinavirritonavir arm with cq 70 of the patients had a negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr at day 7 90 at day 10 and 100 at day 14 compared to the lpv-r group where 58 of the patients had a negative rt-pcr at day 7 75 at day 10 and 92 at day 14 there was a delay in lung clearance based on ct imaging suggesting viral clearance does not translate immediately into pathological improvement in lungs with cq 20 had a ct scan improvement at day 10 and 100 at day 14 compared to anti-virals with 8 showing an improvement at day 10 and 75 at day 14 with cq discharge rates from hospital were 100 at day 14 but with anti-virals only 50 of the patients were discharged at day 14 6 studies examined the effects of hcq of which 2 also added azithromycin 4 compared it to a standardized care and 2 were case series with hcq and azithromycin 4 studies analysed clinical recovery whilst 6 studied viral clearance there have been 3 rcts in china in the study by chen et al 1  where the eligibility criteria are not known 30 patients were recruited with 15 patients in each arm it showed no significant difference p005 in negative seroconversion rate at day 7 with 87 negative in the hcq group and 93 in the control group and in time to negative seroconversion p005 time to normalization of body temperature was also comparable between the 2 arms and radiological progression using ct imaging showed 33 of the cases progressed of the hcq group compared to 47 in the control group chen et al 2 has included only mild cases with oxygen saturation sao2 93 and confirmed chest ct with pneumonia comparing hcq n31 to standard treatment n31 which was undefined the primary outcome was time to clinical recovery defined as cough relief and return of body temperature 366c on surface 372c under armpit and mouth or 378c in rectum and tympanic membrane maintained for more than 72 hours it was shown that normalization of body temperature was significantly p00008 shorter by 1 day in the hcq group 22 days compared to the control group 32 days there was also significantly p00016 reduced cough remission time in the hcq group 2 days compared to the control group 31 days it was also noted that overall 6 of the patients progressed to a severe illness and these occurred in the control group not receiving hcq 2 testing haemodynamic monitoring and intensive care this study included anyone over the age of 18 with a confirmed sars-cov-2 infection the primary outcome was the negative conversion of sars-cov-2 within 28 days secondary outcomes included alleviation of clinical symptoms defined as resolving fever to axillary temperature of 366c normalization of sao294 on room air disappearance of respiratory symptoms laboratory parameters and chest radiology within 28 days viral clearance was similar in both arms with a negative seroconversion rate at 28 days of 854 and 813 in the hcq arm and soc arm respectively the time to negative seroconversion was also similar with 8 days and 7 days in hcq and soc arms respectively the overall rate of symptom alleviation within 28 days was also similar with hcq 599 and with soc alone 666 the median time to alleviation of clinical symptoms was also similar with 19 days in the hcq arm and 21 days in the soc arm however in a subgroup analysis when confounding effects of other anti-viral agents was removed the efficacy of hcq on the alleviation of symptoms is more evident hazard ratio 883 95ci 109-713 changes in c-reactive protein crp and lymphocyte count were also analysed with the hcq arm showing a significantly greater decline p0045 in crp from baseline 6986 compared to the soc arm 2723 and a greater elevation in lymphocyte count from baseline in the hcq 0062 compared to soc 0008 which was not significant p0547 a french cohort study 7 enrolled 20 patients with hcq and 16 patients was a control regardless of their clinical status it has shown that hcq can provide clearing of nasopharyngeal carriage in 50 of the patients by day 3 compared to 63 without it the same research group have reported a case series 4 with 80 patients on a combination of azithromycin and hcq this showed negative virus cultures in 975 of those included at day 5 with only 15 requiring oxygen and 4 requiring icu however these results were rapidly questioned by another study 6 who followed the same regime of azithromycin and hcq but showed that at day 5 8 out of 10 80 of the patients were still positive for covid-19 rna a total of 8 studies regarding anti-virals was included 6 studies examined the effects of lpvr of these 2 compared it to a standardized care 1 compared it to favipavir 1 compared it to the combination of lpv-r and arbidol 1 compared it to arbidol and 1 compared it to both arbidol and a control group 1 other study compared favipavir to arbidol and a case series regarding remdesivir is also included 4 studies analysed clinical recovery whilst 5 studied viral clearance there are 2 rcts comparing lpv-r to control and one further compares it to arbidol cao et al 14 is the largest rct in this systematic review enrolling 199 patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging sao294 while on breathing ambient air 99 in the lpv-r group and 100 to the standard-care group the primary outcome was the time to clinical improvement defined as time from randomization to improvement of two points on a seven category ordinal scale or live discharge which was 16 days in both lpv-r and standardcare alone in subgroups of treatment within 12 days or later treatment there was no association with a shorter time to clinical improvement secondary outcomes measured included a 28 day mortality which was lower in the lpv-r 192 than in the standard-care all

with clinical improvement at day 14 which was higher in the lpv-r group 455 than in the standard-care group 30 and time to discharge which was shorter in the lpv-r group 12 days than in the standard-care group 14 days other secondary outcomes included duration of oxygen therapy duration of hospitalization and time from randomization to death which had no significant difference between the two groups in terms of virology the percentage of patients with detectable viral rna was similar in both groups on any sampling day 5 10 14 21 and 28 for example at day 5 34 in lpvr group compared to 329 in standard-care group however the mortality in this trial was 221 which is significantly higher than the mortality reported in descriptive studies potentially indicating that a severely ill population was recruited therefore the question of whether this anti-viral treatment may be effective in early treatment remains unaddressed another rct 11 recruiting patients with mild mild symptoms but no signs of pneumonia on imaging or moderate fever respiratory symptoms and pneumonia on imaging covid-19 compared lpv-r arbidol and a control group with no anti-viral medication the primary outcome was time of positive-to-negative conversion of sars-cov-2 from initiation of treatment to day 21 which was not significantly different p0981 time to viral clearance was 9 days 91 days and 93 days in lpv-r arbidol and control group respectively there was also no significant difference of negative conversion rates at day 7 p0966 and day 14 p0352 of treatment there was also no significant difference in secondary outcomes which included rate of antipyresis rate of cough resolution and rate of improvement of chest ct imaging at day 7 and 14 p005 to take into account the influence of time from onset to treatment this was evaluated in those who deteriorate to a severe clinical status 5 days compared to those who did not deteriorate 4 days and showed no significant difference p0619 however one cohort study 9 comparing 42 patients treated with lpv-r to 5 patients in the control group has shown a significant reduction in time for body temperature normalization 48 days in the lpv-r group compared to 73 days in the control group p00364 in one study 12  lpv-r has also been used with arbidol which has higher negative seroconversion rate both at day 7 with 75 negative in the combination group compared to 35 in the lpv-r group p005 and at day 14 94 negative in the combination group compared to 53 negative in the lpv-r group p005 there was also a significant difference p005 in the chest ct scans showing improvement in the combination group 69 when compared to the lpv-r group 29 another cohort study 15 has suggested favipavir is superior with a higher clinical recovery rate at day 7 defined as 72h recovery of body axillary temperature 366c respiratory rate sao2 98 and cough relief mild or none this was significantly different p00001 with 61 of the patients clinically recovered in the favipavir group compared to the 52 in the lpv-r group a case series 16 involving remdesivir for compassionate use in 53 patients showed a 68 of the patients improved in the

decrease of 2 or more points on the six point ordinal scale or live discharge was 84 improvement in this case series 7 13 of the patients died 6 of which were receiving non-invasive ventilation overall mortality from date of admission was 056 per 100 hospitalisation days and when comparing patients receiving invasive ventilation 057 to those receiving non invasive ventilation 051 there was no substantial difference however the risk of death was greater among patients over the age of 70 hazard ratio 1134 and those with a higher serum creatinine hazard ration 191 post-searching a rct done at 10 hospitals in wuhan was published 31  this enrolled 237 patients who were covid-19 positive had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging had sao294 on room air and were within 12 days of symptoms onset 158 to the remdesivir arm and 79 to the placebo arm however only 155 and 78 in the remdesivir and placebo arm respectively were included in the per-protocol population due to withdrawal of consent receiving the medication for less days than the protocol and not starting the study the primary clinical endpoint was time to clinical improvement defined as a two-point reduction in patients admission status on a six-point scale this was not significantly different in the remdesivir group 21 days compared to the placebo group 23 days in those receiving treatment within 10 days there was a numerically faster time to clinical improvement in those in the remdesivir arm 18 days compared to the placebo arm 23 days clinical improvement rates at day 7 14 and day 28 were not significantly different between the remdesivir group and placebo group however numerically at day 14 there was a higher clinical improvement rate at day 14 27 with remdesivir compared to 23 in placebo and at day 28 65 with remdesivir compared to 58 in placebo the 28 day mortality was similar between the remdesivir group 14 and the placebo group 13 other clinical outcomes such as duration of oxygen support duration of invasive mechanical ventilation duration of hospital stay time to discharge and time to death were not significantly different however numerically the days of invasive mechanical ventilation were lower in the remdesivir group 7 days compared to the placebo group 155 days in terms of viral load no differences were observed between both groups with a similar decrease in viral load in the same study adverse events were reported in 66 of the patients 18 serious in the remdesivir group the most common ones being constipation hypoalbuminaemia hypokalaemia anaemia thrombocytopaemia and increased total bilirubin adverse events were also reported in 64 26 serious of the patients in the control group including hypoalbuminaemia constipation anaemia hypokalaemia increased aspartate aminotransferase increased bloods lipids and increased total bilirubin overall more patients discontinued the drug due to adverse events in the remdesivir group 12 than in the placebo group 5 antiviral side effects ranged from 0-60 across the studies with reported side effects such as liver injury high transaminases high bilirubin leucopenia gastro-intestinal and cutaneous side effects diarrhea vomiting nausea rash one randomized controlled trial reported lpv-r adverse effects as 48 192 serious ones compared to 49 32 serious ones in the control group the same study reported that 14 of the patients could not complete the 14 day course of lpv-r due to adverse events there was only one case series regarding remdesivir which reported a 60 adverse event rate including increased hepatic enzymes renal impairment diarrhea rash and hypotension this included 23 of severe adverse events including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome septic shock acute kidney injury and hypotension 16 case reports 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 are summarised in table 4  in each of the cases a number of medications have been trialed antibiotics in 10 of the

june 9 2020  httpsdoiorg1011012020060720124677 doi medrxiv preprint having been declared a global pandemic with the numbers of cases rising everyday covid-19 has been an unprecedented challenge in a number of areas with a subsequent reorganization of the clinical activities 47  clinicians across the world have trialed repurposing a number of medications regarding cq it has been suggested as a more effective and inexpensive option when compared to anti-virals 5  a recent trial 27 has compared the use of high-dosage 12g and low-dosage cq and has suggested that a highdosage regimen with azithromycin and oseltamivir was not safe to continue due to concerns regarding cardiotoxic events myocarditis and qtc interval prolongation which can be associated with an increase in fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia however age can be a confounder as it can be associated with unfavourable outcomes therefore it was advised that high dosage cq should not be recommended in the treatment of severe covid-19 but these findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with non-severe covid-19 the results from randomized controlled trials using hcq have shown a similar negative seroconversion rate and time to clinical recovery when compared to standard care however it has been recorded that hcq may fasten normalization of body temperature and cough remission with some smaller cohorts showing benefit of hcq it is important to be cautious with results therefore overall the role of of hcq in the management for covid-19 may still remain promising but larger scale studies are required showing no difference when compared to standard-care alone however one rct has shown that lpv-r may have a lower 28-day mortality a shorter stay in intensive care a shorter time to discharge and an effect on clinical improvement the only study 16 regarding remdesivir identified in our search was an observational study about a compassionate use in patients with severe covid-19 which showed an 84 clinical improvement and that improved in the category of oxygen support in 68 of the cases after our search was carried out a rct 31 was published comparing remdesivir and placebo showing no significant advantage in time to clinical improvement mortality or time to viral clearance with remdesivir even if well tolerated however the power of this study was insufficient as it did not reach its target enrolment due to the marked reductions in new patient presentations in mid-march in wuhan the initiation of treatment might have been quite late in the disease course as there were restrictions on hospital bed availability to have a significant improvement in outcomes when summarizing the case reports it is challenging to draw conclusions however the clinical improvement of the patients reported with a use of a cocktail of medications is an important aspect to consider the present systematic review has several limitations the paucity of rcts the gold standard for comparing interventions is probably due to difficulties with randomization and blinding in the unprecedented and stressful environment faced by healthcare services therefore a large number of studies are observational or cohort studies which are quicker to organize and implement therefore obtaining results rapidly which is essential as the number of worldwide cases is rising at an alarming rate another limitation is that studies vary in the outcomes measured therefore side-by-side comparisons become more difficult due to this heterogeneity of the studies we were only able to perform a meta-analysis on a maximum of 3 studies in one of the analyses regarding negative seroconversion rate they were measured at different time points therefore not giving an accurate view a large proportion of the studies included also do not measure survival and morbidity outcomes which are important many of the studies included have also not been formally peer reviewed yet but due to the urgency of the pandemic draft manuscripts have been uploaded we included every study found in our systematic review which may have introduced bias therefore it is important to analyse all studies cautiously as the selection of patients is important as different studies have recruited patients with a different severity of covid-19 it is also important to consider the timeline of the administration of the medication as early administration of medication could be more beneficial than later in the course of the disease when using risk of bias assessment tools most of the non-rcts were at serious risk of bias due to confounders including baseline confounding factors such as the presence of comorbidities which could affect the outcome of the patient no blinding of patients or assessors can also pose a risk of bias due to the potential unreliable measurement of outcomes to our knowledge this is the first systematic review regarding the repurposing of drugs in covid-19 summarizing 16 studies as well as 16 case reports in conclusion it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the management of covid-19 due to the lack of evidence however likewise there is also no sufficient evidence to show these drugs are not successful in improving clinical outcomes and reducing viral load therefore it is important to balance the benefits of trialing this medication with the adverse events described where the spectrum of these has not been clearly understood accordingly there is a need for further high quality data especially from rcts to evaluate the benefits of these repurposed drugs in the treatment of patients with covid-19 we recognise there is a large global effort for this with the biggest covid-19 trial the recovery trial 48 having recruited over 8500 participants across 173 sites to date 1 may 2020 this randomized trial is inviting clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed covid-19 adult 18 years patients hospitalised in the united kingdom to participate with randomisation to one of 4 arms usual care usual care plus lpv-r usual care plus low-dose dexamethasone usual care plus hcq or usual care plus azithromycin those who deteriorate are further randomized between tocilizumab and a control group this study indicates no clinical effectiveness regarding the role of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral for the treatment of covid-19 patients however there is potential for these medications but further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings therefore a risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events all rights reserved no reuse allowed

causing mostly mild diseases however some covs such as sars-cov and mers-cov cause severe respiratory diseases sars and mers that result in 10 to 35 mortality 12345 sars-cov caused a pandemic in 2003 with 774 deaths worldwide 678 mers-cov was first reported in june 2012 and according to a world health organization who report there were 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers including 858 associated deaths mostly from middle east countries 9 however the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has claimed thousands of lives since the first reported case in december 2019 in wuhan city china 101112 to date there are no approved vaccines or anti-sars-covmers-cov drugs available hence studies on the discovery of small molecule drugs against sars-cov mers-cov and other related future pathogenic coronaviruses are of high importance 13 covs belong to the family coronaviridae of the nidovirales order covs have been divided into    and -coronavirus genera 14 the  covs have been further divided into four lineages ad 15 phylogenic analysis shows that both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 belong to lineage b of  covs 1617 whereas mers-cov belongs is lineage c and the well-studied mouse hepatitis virus mhv in lineage a 181920 an example of lineage d is rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 21 coronaviruses are the largest 262 to 317 kb positive or  sense single stranded rna viruses the polyadenylated and capped rna genome 522 has multiple open reading frames orfs the 5-most two-third of the genome contains orf1a and orf1b that encode polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab made through a 1 ribosomal frameshift during translation which are cleaved to form the non-structural proteins nsp 2324252627282930 the structural proteins are expressed as subgenomic rnas and individual rnas genomic and subgenomic are translated to yield only the protein encoded by the 5-most orf 31 these polyproteins are processed by coronavirus-encoded

preprint describing the structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12 has appeared 44 apparently this structure has strong similarity to that of sars-cov nsp12 root-mean-square deviation rmsd of 082  for 1078 c atoms including nsp7 and nsp8 c atoms 44 these two cryoem structures reveal that the overall architecture of the nsp12 polymerase domain resembles canonical rna polymerases and assumes a right-hand conformation with structural units reminiscent to fingers palm and thumb 43  historically viral polymerases have proven to be attractive targets for antiviral therapy hiv-1 reverse transcriptase hiv-1 rt hepatitis b virus hbv polymerase hbv pol and hepatitis c virus hcv replicase ns5b are some of the notable examples of antiviral targets all currently recommended first-line antiviral therapies consist of nucleoside analogs that target these viral polymerases additionally nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil 5-fu have been approved as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs whereas ribavirin in-combination with interferon-2b has shown potential for treatment of mers-cov infection in rhesus macaques 45 while resistance mutations under 5-fu pressure have been determined in mhv nsp12 46 additionally gemcitabine a nucleoside analog and a well-known cancer drug has been identified as inhibiting sars and mers-covs 47  the emergence of recent pandemic covid-19 has compelled researchers and clinicians to explore novel broad-spectrum drugs as inhibitors of sars-cov-2 thus nucleoside analogs favipiravir t-705 4849 and remdesivir 49505152 have shown inhibitory potential against sars-cov-2 owing to the potential of remdesivir the united states food and drug administration fda has granted an orphan drug status on 23 march 2020 so that it can be used in clinics and a clinical trial has started at the university of nebraska medical center omaha ne nct04280705 in order to explore the feasibility of broad-spectrum nucleoside inhibitors of rna polymerases as potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 we used comparative molecular modeling docking and bioinformatics to assess these compounds as potential inhibitors of nsp12 more specifically we present the feasibility of remdesivir 5-fu ribavirin and favipiravir t-705 as anti-sars-cov-2 compounds  nucleoside analog inhibitors are administered as compounds containing a nucleic acid base with modified sugar moiety these compounds are metabolized into their triphosphate tp form by cellular kinases becoming the bona fide substrates of nucleic acid polymerases the nucleic acid polymerases contain conserved motifs that participate in nucleoside-tp ntp binding 53 first we assessed sequence conservation in the ntp-binding motifs using available nsp12 sequences of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 we then conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of nsp12 proteins using available sequences from sars-cov n  40 mers-cov n  14 and sars-cov-2 n  26 along with bat cov n  31 figure 1a our analyses showed that sars-cov-2 is closely related to the bat cov-ratg13 strain which is consistent with earlier reports 8 the majority of sequence variation was present in the n-terminal region of nsp12 belonging to niran and interface domains the description of the interface domain in presented in the following section the polymerase domain amino acid residues 399932 is highly conserved among all sars-cov-2 nsp12 proteins with only nine substitutions t614n n650s h742t e743d d746n y769f n772t a775s a787s with respect to sars-cov figure 1a the rdrp motifs a to g are highly conserved in the sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 strains figure 1b sars-cov-2 rdrp motifs are fully conserved within currently available strain sequences n  179 figure 1c this is further supported with the large number of sequences n  4551 as of 20 april 2020 available in the genomic epidemiology of hcov-19 httpswwwgisaidorgepiflu-applicationsnext-hcov-19-app based on the cryoem structure nsp12 has been divided into three structural regions i the niran domain residues 117250 ii interface domain residues 251398 and iii polymerase domain residues 399919 43 the recently reported structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12 showed the presence of a newly identified n-terminal -hairpin which interacts with the palm subdomain of nsp12 we modeled sars-cov-2 nsp12 structure using the available cryoem structure of sars-cov nsp12 pdb file 6nur 43 the protein sequence of sars-cov nsp12 has 999 identity with gz02 isolate genbank accession number aas00002 the sars-cov-2 nsp12 sequence that we used in homology modeling was taken from isolate wiv05 genbank accession number qhr63269 the two sequences nsp12 from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have 94 identity with the most sequence variation existing in the n-terminal -hairpin niran and interface domains figure 1a  the modeled structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12 figure 2 superposed extremely well on to the cryoem structure of sars-cov nsp12 rmsd of 05  for 802 c atoms nine non-conserved residues in the polymerase domain are located at the surface of nsp12 distal to the polymerase active site d621 d760 and d761 all conserved rdrp motifs ag 13 were easily identifiable in the modeled structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12 figure 2b one of the unusual features of modeled sars-cov-2 nsp12 is the partial -strand structure of motif a that contains one carboxylate d621 of the catalytic triad in fact a similar conformation is present in the cryoem structure of sars-cov nsp12 43 motifs a and c are known to form a three-stranded -sheet composed of one strand from motif a and two strands from motif c in both rdrps and dna-dependent dna polymerases however the crystal structures of poliovirus rdrp 3dpol and enterovirus 71 rdrp 3dpol elongation complexes showed subtle conformational changes in the palm subdomain called the active site closure and that the presence of incoming substrate induces inter--strand hydrogen bonds required for classification as -strand reviewed by peersen 54 therefore the partial -strand structure of motif a is expected to adopt a complete -strand conformation in the complex consisting of primer-template pt and the nucleoside triphosphate ntp remdesivir gs-441524 is a 1-cyano 4-aza-79-dideazaadenosine c-adenosine nucleoside analog it is a broad-spectrum rna polymerase inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit human and mouse covs 52 more importantly remdesivir has been shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro 4855 a recent report showed that compassionate-use of remdesivir showed improvement in 68 of covid-19 patients 56 the antiviral activity of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 is not surprising as it is a nucleoside analog and expected to bind at the ntp-binding site which is highly conserved among sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 nsp12 polymerases figure 1b except motifs d and g all other motifs either directly participate in ntp bindinghydrolysis or are spatially located in close vicinity of the remdesivir-tp binding site a molecular model consisting of enzyme remdesivir-tp and rna pt is shown in figure 3a motifs a and c harbor catalytic site carboxylates and motif b binds the basesugar moiety of the ntp both are close to remdesivir-tp figure 3a motif e which is in the vicinity of the ntp binding pocket is present only in rna polymerases and has been termed as primer grip 67 this motif is also in close proximity to remdesivir-tp motif f contains a highly conserved basic residue which interacts with the tp moiety of ntp we also identified r558 in the sars-cov-2 nsp12ptremdesivir-tp model as the conserved motif f basic residue which interacts with the -phosphate figure 3a  resistance to remdesivir has been demonstrated in in vitro passage assays 57 two mutations f476l and v553l in mhv nsp12 appeared after 23 passages amino acid residues f476 and v553 counterparts are numbered f483 and v560 respectively in the cryoem structure of sars-cov hence hereafter we will refer to these residues according to their numbering in the cryoem structure of sars-cov nsp12 ie f483 and v560 both f483 and v560 are absolutely conserved in - - and -covs and belong to the fingers subdomain of nsp12 their locations relative to remdesivir-tp are shown in figure 3bc respectively v560 is proximal to motif f in our model of nsp12ptremdesivir-tp complex v560 is close to the template nucleotide that is base-paired with remdesivir-tp or incoming ntp topologically equivalent valine v181 interacts with the templating base in the crystal structures of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv 3dpol consisting of eptatp 58 and coxsackievirus 3b 3dpol 54 therefore mutation v560l in nsp12 may alter the position of the template nucleotide and reduce the binding of remdesivir-tp thereby imparting resistance to remdesivir  f483 is located adjacent to motif b and forms hydrophobic interactions with v640 and v696 of motif b mutation to l483 results in a shorter side chain yet maintains hydrophobic interactions with neighboring v640 and v696 it is possible that subtle changes in the hydrophobic interactions may assist in the known mechanism of active site closure in rdrps 2930 to enhance fidelity of nsp12 ie preferential selection of ntp over remdesivir-tp  the polymerase domain of sars-cov nsp12 has a high structural homology with picornavirus 3dpol 43 hence we reasoned that the nucleoside analogs known to inhibit the well-studied fmdv 3dpol might inhibit nsp12 the mechanism of inhibition of two major nucleoside analogs 5-fu and ribavirin has been structurally well studied 585960 below we discuss the feasibility of 5-fu and ribavirin for the inhibition sars-cov-2 nsp12  5-fu is a pyrimidine analog that has been used in clinics as an anti-cancer drug for many years 6162 additionally it is a mutagen for several viruses 4663 incorporation of 5-fu-monophosphate 5-fump into the viral genome by rdrps leads to error catastrophe 6465 efficient extinction of fmdv has been achieved by 5-fu in combination with guanidine hydrochloride and heparin 66 additionally 5-fu after its conversion to 5-fu-triphosphate 5-futp blocks initiation of fmdv rna synthesis and therefore functions as an initiation inhibitor 67 mutations in rdrp enzymes under 5-fu pressure impart fitness loss in the absence of 5-fu but confer a fitness gain in presence of 5-fu most rna viruses do not possess a proofreading activity therefore these viruses overcome the effect of mutagens by selecting resistance mutations that enhance the fidelity rna synthesis 68  covs also encode nsp14 which acts as a proofreading enzyme deletion of nsp14 renders sars-cov sensitive to 5-fu 69 furthermore mapping the mutations affecting fidelity in coxsackievirus b3 onto the mhv nsp12 molecular model and introducing these mutations into mhv with nsp14-exon or without nsp14-exon exonuclease activity two mutations v560i and m618f were identified that conferred resistance to 5-fu 46 mutation at nsp12 codon 560 v560l has also been reported for remdesivir discussed above therefore resistance to 5-fu by mutation at v560 may occur through the repositioning of templating nucleotide which in turn may alter the selectivity of the enzyme for utp over 5-futp  we have previously reported that mutation v173i in fmdv 3dpol enhances selectivity of utp over 5-futp 70 using pre-steady state kinetics we showed that v173i mutation in fmdv 3dpol enhances the selectivity of utp over 5-futp by 32-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme the selectivity of utp over 5-futp by v173i 3dpol was primarily due to the increase in the dissociation of 5-futp from the elongation complex which resulted in restricted 5-fump incorporation 70 fmdv containing v173i survived the mutagenic activity of 5-fu by compensating for the increase in ag and uc transitions that the wild-type virus endures in the presence of 5-fu 70 compensation in the mutant virus entails an increase of ga and cu transitions in the presence of 5-fu which approximates the mutational pattern to that of the wild-type virus replicating in the absence of 5-fu 70 due to the fact that covs contain an exonuclease enzyme the change in ntp selectivity may be a primary mechanism of 5-fu resistance since the misincorporation of 5-fump would most likely be corrected by the nsp14 exonuclease  5-fu resistance mutation position m618 belongs to the conserved motif a as described above the active site closure mechanism of rdrps serves as a fidelity control 71 a comparison of rdrp palm domains suggests that all  strand rna viruses use this active site closure mechanism to optimize the fidelity of rna synthesis 14 as shown in figure 4 m618 is clustered among hydrophobic residues emanating from motifs a dark-red c red and d green mutation m618f will result in the introduction of a bulky side chain phenylalanine which is also more hydrophobic than methionine this may lead to a subtle change in the palm-based closure mechanism of rdrps in the case of nsp12 and therefore enhance the fidelity of rna synthesis m618 is topologically equivalent to position i230 in coxsackievirus and f230 of poliovirus mutation at this position has been shown to affect the fidelity of the rdrp 14 hence it is possible that selection of m618f in the presence of 5-fu is related to the fidelity of nsp12 ribavirin 1--d-ribofuranosyl-124-triazole-3-carboxamide is an fda approved antiviral drug it is one of the most widely used broad-spectrum inhibitors of rna viruses similar to 5-fu it is mutagenic for many rna viruses 64727374757677 ribavirin has been in clinics for many years to treat hcv in combination with pegylated interferon 78 fmdv 79 and poliovirus 80 additionally ribavirin in combination with interferon-2a or 2b has been shown to inhibit mers-cov infection 818283 ribavirin triphosphate rtp binds at the ntp binding site of fmdv 3dpol 58 due to the fact that ntp binding motifs are highly conserved among rdrps figure 1 and figure 2 rtp is predicted to bind and exert its inhibitory effect on all covs including sars-cov-2 resistance to ribavirin in different rna viruses is achieved by mutations in the rdrp coding gene in poliovirus fmdv and enterovirus 71 mutations in the 3dpol rdrp confer resistance to ribavirin 84858687 hcv develops resistance to ribavirin when used in combination with pegylated interferon by blocking downstream signaling actions of stat1 stat2 irf9 and jak-stat pathways 8889 and by mutation in the rdrp gene 9091 mutations g64s and l420a in poliovirus 3dpol m296i in fmdv 3dpol and f415y in hcv ns5b have been reported to impart resistance to ribavirin mutations at g64 and l123 in enterovirus 71 3dpol have also been reported to confer ribavirin resistance 87  structurally ribavirin resistance mutation sites in rna polymerases do not appear to be in absolutely equivalent positions a structural alignment showed that g64 in poliovirus 3dpol is 17  away from the active site whereas m296 in fmdv 3dpol is part of the ntp binding site ie within 12  while y415 in hcv ns5b and l420 in poliovirus 3dpol are at topologically equivalent positions they are 22  away in the thumb subdomain in poliovirus 3dpol resistance to ribavirin is achieved by mutations at g64 and at l420 figure 5 these two mutation sites are almost posterior to the active site residue d868 of nsp12 is topologically equivalent to l420 of poliovirus 3dpol whereas n462 nsp12 can be tentatively assigned as the equivalent to g64 3dpol both y415 of ns5b and l420 of poliovirus 3dpol interact with the rna primer strand near the active site 9293 mutation g64s in poliovirus 3dpol and m296i in fmdv 3dpol change the fidelity of the two enzymes 9495 whereas mutation l420a facilitates rna recombination 86 these examples suggest that resistance to ribavirin can be achieved by more than one mechanism it is possible that resistance to ribavirin in sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 can develop through mutation at d868 or through yet another unknown mutation andor mechanism favipiravir t-705 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of rna viruses 9697 including ebola virus 98 crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever 99 lassa virus 100 and chikungunya virus 101 it was also approved as an anti-influenza drug in 2014 in japan and more recently the italy aifa and china fda have approved its use for treatment of covid-19  favipiravir was discovered by chemical modification of a pyrazine analog t-1106 96 after entering the cell favipiravir is metabolized into the triphosphate form t-705-rtp that is recognized by rdrps t-705-rtp competes with atp and gtp 101 suggesting that it is recognized as a purine analogue in contrast to many nucleoside inhibitors favipiravir does not have a sugar moiety when administered human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase converts t-705 into its ribose-5-monophosphate rmp prior to formation of t-705-rtp 102 mechanisms of inhibition by t-705 have been demonstrated by the chain termination of nascent rna 103 and by induction of lethal mutagenesis 104105 currently favipiravir is being evaluated for covid-19 treatment and the results are awaited resistance to t-705 by rdrps is achieved by mutation of a conserved lysine of motif f thus in chikungunya rdrp k291r exerts low-level resistance to t-705 101 and mutation k159r in coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 3dpol resulted in a nonviable virus 106 the replication competence of k159r virus was restored by the a239g mutation biochemical results suggested that k159r reduced the processivity of cvb3 3dpol and the double mutant k159ra239g had low fidelity 106 the cvb3 k159 equivalent in nsp12 is k548 currently it is not known if the mutation of k548 will have effect on favipiravir however considering its conserved position the resistance to favipiravir by sars-cov-2 is quite possible the nsp12 protein sequences of bat cov sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 were retrieved using blastp protein-protein blast algorithm with blosum62 matrix multiple sequence analysis was performed in aliview software the ml tree was inferred using raxml v8120 107 the branch supports were computed out of 100 bootstrapped trees the tree was visualized in figtree v144 httptreebioedacuk the circos plot was created using circos software package v 069-8 amino acid changes in sars-cov-2 against sars-cov were obtained by pairwise sequence alignment using aliview v126 108 homology-derived molecular model of sars-cov-2 nsp12 was generated using prime of schrdinger suite schrdinger llc new york ny usa and the cryoem structure of sars-cov 43 pdb file 6nur to generate ternary complex containing enzymeptntp or enzymeptnucleoside-tp the pt and rtp from the crystal structure of fmdv 3dpol 58 pdb file 2e9r were extracted and docked into the modeled structure of nsp12 the templating nucleotide was modified as required for the complementarity of the incoming substrate all the complexes were energy minimized using the jaguar program of schrodinger suite  in conclusion here we show that the nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket is largely conserved among diverse rna-dependent rna polymerases and that the broad-spectrum nucleoside inhibitors discussed may have potential in covid-19 treatment while it is possible that sars-cov-2 may evolve with drug resistance mutations against these nucleoside inhibitors knowledge of potential escape mutants may aid in the development of more specific sars-cov-2 inhibitors with a higher resistance barrier the emerging genomic sequences and structures of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 nsp12 also offer increasing insight into the design and identification of novel nucleoside inhibitors or small molecules that are specific to sars-cov-2 nsp12 and could be used against the current covid-19 pandemic or in future cov outbreaks the in vitro analysis that is presently on-going in the laboratory will provide a better picture of their comparative in vitro potency and resistance profile additionally the use of these antivirals has an added benefit as a significant wealth of knowledge already exists regarding their administration efficacy toxicity and side effects in humans which can speed up clinical trials in covid-19 patients inhibitors targeting nsp12 will block the replication of both  and - strand of the viral genome which is essential for the formation of a mature and infectious virus   enisamium is a small molecule inhibitor of the influenza a virus and sars-cov-2 rna polymerases alexander walker p haitian fan jeremy keown r victor margitich jonathan grimes m ervin fodor aartjan te velthuis j   influenza a virus and sars-cov-2 are respiratory viruses capable of causing pandemics and the latter is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic both viruses encode rna polymerases which transcribe their rna genomes and are important targets for antiviral drugs including remdesivir here we show that the antiviral drug enisamium inhibits the rna polymerases of both influenza a virus and sars-cov-2 furthermore we show that a putative metabolite of enisamium is a more potent inhibitor inhibiting the sars-cov-2 rna polymerase with similar efficiency to remdesivir our data offer insight into the mechanism of action for enisamium and implicate it as a broad-spectrum antiviral which could be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection rna viruses such as pandemic influenza a viruses iav and severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 are among the most important human pathogens while iav and sars-cov-2 are different viruses and follow different replication cycles both can cause severe respiratory disease in humans that leads to high morbidity and mortality vaccines exist against influenza viruses however long vaccine development times mean that antigenic mismatches can occur between circulating influenza virus strains and the vaccine strain moreover due to antigenic shift existing vaccines are not effective against emerging pandemic influenza a viruses1 no vaccine currently exists against coronaviruses including the sars-cov-2 pandemic and sars-cov epidemic strains which cause coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and sars respectively therefore research is needed into conserved viral enzymatic activities such as rna polymerase activity which could be targeted by broad spectrum antivirals2 3 iavs are negative sense rna viruses whose 14 kb genome consists of eight segments of single-stranded viral rna vrna the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase flupol copies the vrna into a replicative intermediate called the complementary rna crna during viral replication or into capped and polyadenylated viral messenger rna mrna during viral transcription4 5 the crna serves as a template for the production of new vrna molecules vrna and crna molecules are both replicated in the context of ribonucleoproteins rnps which consist of flupol bound to the 5 and 3 ends of a genome segment and the rest of the vrna or crna is bound by a helical coil of nucleoprotein np flupol is composed of three subunits polymerase basic 1 pb1 pb2 and polymerase acidic pa structural analyses have shown that the pb1 subunit adopts the canonical polymerase right hand-like fold which contains the fingers palm and thumb subdomains that are conserved among all viral rna polymerases the pa subunit has a large c-terminal domain that is integrated into the pb1 thumb subdomain and is connected to an n-terminal endonuclease domain by a linker the pb2 subunit is composed of several globular domains including cap binding and 627 domains which are flexible with respect to the core pb1 subunit4 sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus in the order nidovirales and has a positive-sense non-segmented rna genome of around 30 kilobases2 6 the viral genome has a 5 m7gpppam cap and 3 polya tail modifications which allow the viral genome to be translated by cellular machinery two-thirds of the viral genome encodes two overlapping open reading frames orfs 1a and 1b which are translated into two large polyproteins immediately upon infection the two polyproteins are cleaved by intrinsic proteolytic activity to produce non-structural proteins nsps 1-16 which collectively form the membrane-associated replication-transcription complex rtc the rtc has several major functions firstly it synthesises full-length negative-sense rna antigenomes which are the templates for new positive-sense rna genomes secondly it synthesises subgenomic negative-sense rnas which contain the ribosome-accessible orfs of structural and accessory proteins finally the rtc transcribes subgenomic or full-length negative-sense rnas into 5 m7gpppam capped 3 polyadenylated viral mrnas the multiple functions of the replicase complex requires nsp1-16 to have many catalytic activities such as cap synthesis which are not entirely understood7 nsp12 is the rna-dependent rna polymerase component of the replicase complex and it requires nsp7 and nsp8 for processivity8 9 the structures of nsp7812 complexes from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have been solved by cryo-em1013 nsp12 is the core of the complex that adopts the canonical right-handed rna polymerase fold that is linked to an n-terminal domain implicated in nucleotidyltransferase activity14 one nsp7 and two nsp8 molecules form a complex with each nsp12 iav flupol and sars-cov rtc are important drug targets favipiravir t-705 triphosphate fig 1 inhibits flupol rna synthesis activity and other catalytic activities such as the pa endonuclease have also been targeted15 16 remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue drug that has shown promise in both cell culture and clinical trials as a treatment for sars-cov-2 infection17 remdesivir triphosphate fig 1 is the active metabolite of remdesivir which inhibits the sars-cov-2 nsp7812 complex and is not excised by the nsp14 exonuclease 12 further nucleoside analogue drugs have also been suggested as therapeutic candidates18 however there are currently no drugs licensed to treat sars-cov-2 infection enisamium 4-benzylcarbamoyl-1-methylpyridinium iodide fav00a fig 1 marketed as amizon was highlighted by the world health organisation as a candidate therapeutic against sars-cov-2 19 fav00a is licensed for use in 11 countries including ukraine and russia and has been shown to have clinical efficacy against influenza a and b virus infections20 it is thought to inhibit influenza virus rna synthesis however the mechanism of action is currently unknown21 in this study we show that fav00a and a putative hydroxylated metabolite fig 1 vr17-04 inhibit flupol and sars-cov-2 polymerase activity in vitro the inhibition of rna synthesis by both polymerases implies that fav00a is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of rna virus rna synthesis and is a possible therapeutic option for treating sars-cov-2 infection previous experiments showed that enisamium can inhibit influenza virus replication in tissue culture21 we confirmed these observations by infecting a549 cells with influenza awsn33 h1n1 virus wsn at moi 001 and adding enisamium chloride fav00b to the cell culture medium forty-eight hours after infection virus titres were analysed by plaque assay on mdck cells fav00b significantly affected iav tires in line with previous observations fig 2a to test if fav00b can inhibit iav rna synthesis in a minigenome context hek 293t cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the pb1 pb2 and pa flupol subunits np and a segment 5 np vrna template to estimate the effect of fav00b on host cell rna and protein synthesis we transfected a plasmid expressing gfp from a constitutively active cmv promoter as a further control we analysed the effect of enisamium on the 5s ribosomal rna rrna and tubulin protein steady state level after transfection fav00b was added to the cell culture medium at the concentrations indicated in fig 2b total cellular rna was extracted 24 hours post-transfection and iav replication vrna synthesis activity was analysed by radioactive primer extension fav00b significantly affected iav replication with an ic50 of 354 m while there was no significant effect on 5s rrna gfp pa subunit or tubulin expression levels fig 2b overall these observations suggest that enisamium has no effect on host cell viability but inhibits iav replication through the inhibition of vrna synthesis by flupol to examine the effect of enisamium on iav rna synthesis in vitro we expressed protein a-tagged wsn iav flupol in hek 293t cells and purified the heterotrimeric complex using igg sepharose chromatography we then performed in vitro rna synthesis assays using a model 14 nucleotide nt viral rna vrna template in the presence of different concentrations of fav00a or t-705 triphosphate as a positive control in these assays fav00a weakly inhibited flupol activity with an ic50 of 463 mm while t-705 triphosphate inhibited flupol activity with an ic50 of 0011 mm fig 2c this suggests that the inhibitory effect of enisamium on flupol activity in vitro is limited the weak inhibition of flupol by enisamium is unlikely to be responsible for antiviral efficacy observed in cell culture to test if a metabolite of enisamium could be a more potent inhibitor of flupol activity we treated a549 cells with fav00a for 24 hours and then performed flupol activity assays in the presence of cellular extract we observed a strong concentration-dependent inhibition of flupol activity which is consistent with a metabolite of enisamium inhibiting influenza virus rna synthesis fig 2d to test if enisamium metabolites have a direct effect on flupol activity in vitro 9 metabolites were synthesised table 1 and assayed in in vitro reactions containing purified flupol only a hydroxylated metabolite vr17-04 showed substantially increased potency compared to fav00a fig 1 with an ic50 of 084 mm it inhibited flupol activity 55-fold more potently than fav00a fig 2c to study whether vr17-04 has a direct effect of flupol initiation or nucleotide incorporation we measured the effect of vr17-04 on the ability of flupol to extend a capped rna primer in this assay a capped rna primer ending in ag can be aligned to the terminal u or uc of the template fig 3a these two different initiation modes lead to the formation of two extension products called the c- and g-product fig 3a a realignment step that can occur as the polymerase slips at 4u of the template can add an additional 3 nt to each extension product increasing the number of possible extension products22 addition of vr17-04 to the capped primer extension assay resulted in absence of extension at high concentrations and predominantly partial extension of the primer by only 1-2 nucleotides at intermediate vr17-04 concentrations fig 3b in addition we observed that formation of the c-product was reduced suggesting that vr17-04 also affected primer-template binding collectively these data show that hydroxylation of enisamium increases the potency as inhibitor in vitro and that hydroxylated enisamium directly affects nucleotide incorporation by flupol to determine if enisamium and its putative metabolite vr17-04 can inhibit the sars-cov-2 rtc we developed a sars-cov-2 rna polymerase in vitro assay that involved nsp12 as the rna-dependent rna polymerase and nsp7 and nsp8 as processivity factors8 we expressed and purified sars-cov-2 nsp7 nsp8 and nsp12 and mixed them at a ratio of 221 to form a nsp7812 complex fig 4a to test in vitro rna synthesis activity we incubated the nsp7812 complex with a 40 nt rna template and a radiolabelled 20 nt rna primer fig 4bc the nsp7812 complex was able to extend the 20 nt primer in the presence of ntps into a doublet of major products of approximately 40 nt in length this pattern was previously observed for the sars-cov nsp7812 complex8 the proportion of 20 nt primer extended by nsp7812 increased over time plateauing at around 30 minutes fig 4c remdesivir triphosphate is a nucleotide analogue shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 nsp7812 activity12 to estimate the potency of this inhibition we performed in vitro rna synthesis assays in the presence of remdesivir triphosphate or t-705 triphosphate fig 5a remdesivir triphosphate inhibited rna synthesis activity with an ic50 of 201mm while t-705 triphosphate was non-inhibitory at all concentrations tested next we performed in vitro rna synthesis assays in the presence of fav00a and the putative metabolite vr17-04 fig 5b fav00a inhibited nsp7812 activity at relatively high concentrations with an ic50 of 407 mm vr17-04 exhibited over 10-fold more potent inhibition with an estimated ic50 of 2-3 mm similar to that obtained for remdesivir triphosphate these ic50 values are within an order of magnitude of those calculated for the inhibition of flupol by fav00a and vr17-04 fig 5c collectively these data show that rna synthesis by the sars-cov-2 nsp7812 complex is inhibited by enisamium and its putative metabolite vr17-04 in this study we showed that enisamium and a putative metabolite vr17-04 inhibit flupol rna synthesis activity in vitro we also established an in vitro rna synthesis assay for the nsp7812 complex of sars-cov-2 and used this assay to show that enisamium and vr17-04 also inhibit rna synthesis by sars-cov-2 nsp7812 specifically we find that vr17-04 inhibits sars-cov-2 rna synthesis with a similar ic50 to remdesivir triphosphate our in vitro assays indicate that fav00a inhibits flupol activity with a relatively high ic50 value of 463 mm fig 2c this inhibition was improved 55-fold by addition of a hydroxyl group in the compound vr17-04 fig 1 which we propose is an active metabolite of enisamium similar ic50 values of 407mm and 2-3mm were observed for fav00a and vr17-04 respectively against the sars-cov-2 rna polymerase fig 5c the exact mechanism of rna synthesis inhibition by enisamium is unknown but our in vitro assays suggest that enisamium can directly inhibit flupol elongation fig 3 further studies such as drug binding assays could be used to provide further insight into the mechanism of action of vr17-04 while vr17-04 inhibits flupol activity with an ic50 of 084 mm enisamium inhibits influenza virus growth in cell culture more potently with ec90 values ranging from 157-439 m fig 2a21 this apparent discrepancy may be due to enisamium exerting additional antiviral effects through other mechanisms or more potent unknown metabolites however it could also be due to the in vitro assays not fully reflecting the requirements for rna polymerase activity in an in vivo situation while our flupol in vitro assays examine the synthesis of a short 14 nt product in vivo flupol must processively synthesise rna products ranging in length between 890 nt and 2341 nt depending on the viral genome segment23 in the sars-cov-2 nsp7812 in vitro activity assay we examine the extension of an rna primer by 20 nt however during infection nsp7812 must synthesise rna products up to 30 kilobases7 moreover protein concentrations in the in vitro reactions may be higher than in cell culture systems therefore it is not surprising that rna synthesis inhibitors can show better efficacy in vivo than in vitro indeed this phenomenon is exemplified by the nucleoside analogue drug remdesivir remdesivir has a reported ic50 of 077 m against sars-cov-2 in cell culture while we find that remdesivir triphosphate has a much higher ic50 of 201 mm in vitro which is similar to values observed previously fig 5a12 17 we find that sars-cov-2 nsp7812 complex activity is inhibited by fav00a and vr17-04 with similar ic50 values to flupol 407mm and 2-3mm respectively fig 5c this suggests that the concentration of enisamium required for in vivo efficacy against sars-cov-2 may be similar to that required for influenza virus which is not toxic in cell culture and humans 21fig 2b furthermore the ic50 value of vr17-04 against nsp7812 is similar to that of remdesivir triphosphate fig 5c the similar in vitro efficacy of remdesivir triphosphate and the putative enisamium metabolite vr17-04 suggests that enisamium could inhibit sars-cov-2 replication as well the rapid global spread of sars-cov-2 necessitates development of effective therapeutic interventions and the most promising short-term strategy is to repurpose existing drugs our results demonstrate that enisamium which is approved for use against influenza in 11 countries inhibits rna synthesis by the sars-cov-2 nsp7812 complex a putative enisamium metabolite has similar in vitro efficacy against sars-cov-2 rna polymerase activity as remdesivir triphosphate this raises the possibility that enisamium could be a viable therapeutic option against sars-cov-2 infection moreover unlike remdesivir enisamium does not require intravenous administration which would be advantageous for its use outside of a hospital setting a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group phase 3 trial will need to be used to assess the antiviral efficacy and safety of enisamium iodide amizon in

 a global treatments for coronaviruses including covid19 bahman yousefi saeid valizadeh hadi ghaffari azadeh vahedi mohsen karbalaei majid eslami   looking at the major pandemics of respiratory viruses we are mainly exposed to the influenza virus the pandemics that occurred in 1918 1957 1968 and 2009 and various theories predict that the next pandemic of this category of respiratory infections will occur between 2020 and 2050 and be capable of causing a human epidemic holmes 2013 seasonal influenza is primarily an upper respiratory disease that recurs in different forms each year the flu shot or annual vaccine is the best way to prevent the flu and all highrisk healthcare workers are advised to be vaccinated every year but sometimes more dangerous and even deadly forms occur that are likely to lead to epidemics and pandemics andrews 2006 in late december 2019 in wuhan china several patients were diagnosed with viral pneumonia now known as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov subsequently a large number of cases of the disease were found to either reside in wuhan or travel to the city the researchers were able to obtain the 2019ncov genome sequence by performing bronchoalveolar lavage and culture of patients lungs and by conducting phylogenetic analyzes of the genome and investigating the evolutionary relationship between 2019ncov and other coronaviruses they found the origin of 2019ncov and its evolutionary history the 2019ncov genomic sequence obtained from the patients showed that 9899 of their gene sequences matched the genome also has an 88 similarity to the genome of the batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 bat coronavirus genomes that appeared in zhoushan china but with the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov coronaviruses 79 and 50 were similar respectively also by homology modeling a model for the virus receptor was obtained which by comparing homology models concluded that despite differences in some amino acids the structure of the domains attached to the receptor at 2019ncov and sarscov was similar sarscov spike s protein is essential for entry into the host cell the spike s1 subunit contains the receptorbinding domain rbd the sarscov virus uses the angiotensinconvertingenzyme 2 ace2 receptor to bind the host cell that contains a diversity of respiratory epithelial cells alveolar macrophages and monocytes considering the relatively high identity of the rbd in 2019ncov and sarscov it is crucial to evaluate the crossreactivity of antisarscov antibodies with 2019ncov spike protein which could have significant implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019ncov these structures displayed that sarscov rbd contains a core structure and a receptorbinding motif rbm and that the rbm binds to the outer surface of ace2 the ace2 is the only known human homolog of the key regulator of blood pressure ace sarscov2 rbd showed significantly higher binding affinity to ace2 receptor than sarscov rbd and could block the connection and therefore binding of sarscov2 and sarscov rbd to ace2expressing cells so inhibiting their infection to host cells therefore ace2 also serves as the cellular entry site for the sarscov a main target for pharmacological intervention and improved new monoclonal antibodies that could attach specifically to 2019ncov rbd sarscov rbdspecific antibodies possibly will crossreact with sarscov2 rbd protein and sarscov rbdinduced antisera could neutralize sarscov2 suggesting the potential to improve sarscov rbdbased vaccines for inhibition of sarscov2 and sarscov infection tai et al 2020 wan shang graham baric  li 2020 bats host a reservoir of various zoonotic viruses including coronaviruses regulatory studies and phylogenetic analyzes have shown that there is a high genetic diversity among sarslike viruses in bats allowing for the recombination and evolution of new species it has been shown that the bat virus with 96 nucleotide sequence similarity to human sarscov can use human ace2 as a receptor this represents the same state of entry into the cell as human sarscov for example bat slcovwiv1 can grow on human epithelial cells and vero e6 cells which is neutralized by human sarscov convalescent sera ge et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the recent crisis was the

difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood while theres a shortage of information on the type of damage that occurs in the lungs during 2019ncov tian et al 2020 wu leung  leung 2020 so far there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease19 covid19 and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as sarscov merscov influenza virus and other viral infections in this article we have tried to study the different treatments performed on patients with covid19 and the advantages and disadvantages of existing drugs and we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with covid19 molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of drugs that have been used to treat covid19 figure 1 also potential antiviral therapeutics for experimental treatment of covid19 shown in table 1 a glycopeptide antibiotic commonly used to treat a bacterial infection is active against sarscov and is on the list of drugs that are also used to treat covid19 j zhang et al 2020 this antibiotic is commonly used to treat grampositive bacterial infections especially staphylococcal and

spiropoulou 2019 teicoplanin acts in the early stages of the viruss life cycle which is blocked by the low ph cleavage of the viral spike protein by cathepsin l in the late endosomes thus blocking the release of the viral rna genome and the virus replication cycle cathepsin l requires entry of the 2019ncov virus into the cell the s protein region known as target teicoplanin which is also present in the 2019ncov virus a study by junsong zhang found that cleavage site cathepsin l is conserved between sarscov and 2019ncov s protein the concentration of teicoplanin required for ic50 in vitro is 166

on remdesivir and clinical trials for the treatment of ebola virus with remdesivir are ongoing one study showed that remdesivir and interferonbeta ifn had a better effect on the merscov mouse model than lopinavir ritonavir and ifn mulangu et al 2019 sheahan et al 2020 previous studies have shown that nucleotide analogs generally have less effect on coronaviruses due to the presence of a proofreading exonuclease in the virus however remdesivir has a positive effect on sarscov merscov and batcov strains in tissue cultures remdesivir is effective in the ec50 range of 0069 m for sarscov and 0074 m for merscov it is effective at sarscov2 at 077 m in vero e6 cells ec90 was 176 m it is also active in the submicromolar ec50 against several different coronaviruses including human endemic coronaviruses oc43 hcovoc43 and 229e hcov229 therefore remdesivir has extensive antiviral activity against coronaviruses brown et al 2019 m wang et al 2020 in a sarscovinfected mouse remdesivir administration significantly reduced the rate of viral load in the lungs and the virus titer decreased more than twofold on day 4 or 5 postinfection indicating that remdesivir improved respiratory symptoms in the laboratory model t sheahan et al 2017 recently in a nonhuman primate model rhesus macaque the therapeutic effect of remdesivir on merscov infection was investigated with remdesivir being injected 3 hr before virus inoculation the results showed that remdesivir prevents lung damage from the virus however the same results were observed when remdesivir was injected into the laboratory model 12 hr after virus inoculation human trials have shown that remdesivir is safe in the human body so the effect of this compound against new coronaviruses can be investigated brown et

drugs had no advantage over standard care and would be approved or rejected in future trials the reason for choosing this drug together was its therapeutic experience at sarscov in 2003 which became the drug of choice cao et al 2020 jin yong kim in korea also achieved similar results with cao et al 2020 in combination with lopinavirritonavir lpvr and no decrease in viral titers was observed in patients with covid19 but was effective in improving clinical symptoms such as fever and cough jin yong kim suggested that it may be effective to get a better effect of the drug in the early stages of the disease but more research is needed within a few days of the disease to determine if better results can be obtained lim et al 2020 but in a study by jun zhang at xixi hospital in hangzhou china a 2020 study showed that 400 mg daily lopinavir with ifn2b atomization inhalation 5 million u twice daily as well as the use of lopinavir alone could be useful for patients with covid19 and increased eosinophils have been suggested as an indicator of improvement in patients but after starting treatment with this drug complications such as digestive adverse effect and hypokalemia should be considered by physicians liu et al 2020 jinyu xias study also showed that the combined effect of arbidol with lpvr was greater than that of lpvr 16 patients received oral arbidol with lpvr and 17

compound used to treat various viral infections such as rsv hepatitis c virus bunyavirus herpesvirus adenovirus poxvirus and some viral hemorrhagic fevers ribavirin was first used in 1980 to treat the

corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone have been proposed as adjunctive therapy albeit with concerns about their use for novel coronavirus patients corticosteroids are widely used to treat severe communityacquired pneumonia to prevent lung damage because they have suppressive effects of severe and systemic inflammation but numerous studies show evidence of the ineffectiveness of corticosteroid treatment on viral pneumonia such as sarscov merscov and h1n1 virus longterm administration of high doses of corticosteroids in the early stages of treatment also has negative effects arabi et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 low or physiological doses of corticosteroids do not reduce the mortality caused by septic shock following primary pulmonary infection but it can also have benefits such as an earlier reversal of shock a shorter time for the patient to exit the icu and mechanical ventilation rhodes et al 2017 corticosteroid therapy for severe patients with ards can reduce pulmonary fibrosis and prevent the progression of serious pathological conditions also the use of low doses can lead to a severe reduction in h1n1 mortality all of these results suggest that the appropriate use of lowdose corticosteroids may lead to recovery and treatment for patients with 2019ncov infection however this treatment should be performed following the guidelines recommended for patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp who have specific clinical symptoms such as ards or septic shock systematic corticosteroids treatment in the first 35 days could increase oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen tensioninspiratory oxygen fraction however corticosteroids do not affect the recovery and survival of ncp patients with ards and shock there are no specific and consistent clinical guidelines for the therapeutic use of corticosteroids in patients in intensive care units generally corticosteroids should be avoided unless the patient has symptoms such as moderate or severe ards sepsis or septic shock until used following recommended who clinical guidelines corticosteroids are also not recommended for mild or early ards because early corticosteroids can delay the clearance of the virus

reovirus flavivirus and coxsackie b3 virus it is also used as an inhibitor of nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes and an immunosuppressant in transplantation and treatment of autoimmune diseases diamond zachariah  harris 2002 padalko et al 2003 it has also been shown to inhibit hepatitis b and hepatitis c virus replication in combination with ifn and cyclosporine a mycophenolic acid mpa in use with cyclosporine it is also a potent inhibitor of merscov but has a less inhibitory effect on sarscov in studies of coronaviruses in the mouse model it did not affect sarscov but at standard concentrations at oral doses it was able to inhibit merscov chan et al 2013 henry et al 2006 markland mcquaid jain  kwong 2000 mpa acts as a synergism with ifn1b and thiopurine analogs but it has less protective effect than the combined effect of lopinavirritonavir with ifn1b the use of this compound in bedside coronaviruses was that with the ifn1b used in saudi arabia to treat merscov all patients using this drug combination could survive but patients had lower acute physiology and chronic health allison  eugui 1993 mpa also had a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of hcovoc43 and hcovnl63 at ec50 concentrations of 195 m and 019 m respectively shen et al 2019 lin et al 2018 also showed that mpa along with disulfiram and 6thioguanine was synergistically inhibitors of the merscov papainlike protease merscov plpro angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 gene ace2 is a metalloproteinase with 805 amino acids which is an important receptor for entry of sarscov into the host cell domain s1 in the sarscov spike protein binds the virus to the ace2 cell receptor present in the host cells therefore understanding the association between sarscov sarscov2 and ace2 can be an effective therapeutic approach lin et al 2018 ace2 is a homolog of carboxy peptidase that is best known for cleaving different peptides in the reninangiotensin system ras and other substrates such as apelin batlle wysocki  satchell 2020 this enzyme is mostly present in organs such as the kidneys gastrointestinal tract and relatively low level in the lungs and its expression has been reported in type 2 pneumocytes hamming et al 2004 the extracellular domain of ace2 acts as the sarscov and sarscov2 spike protein receptor the new coronavirus also uses membranebound ace2 as the receptor ace2 neutralizes sarscov2 in vitro by combining with the fc protein of immunoglobulin lei et al 2020 in addition sarscov2 binds to ace2 with a higher affinity than sarscov in this context the preparation of a soluble and recombinant form of ace2 protein in humans could be useful as a novel biological treatment to counter or limit the progression of infection caused by coronaviruses that use ace2 as a receptor wrapp et al 2020 thus if ace2 is presented as a suitable recombinant protein in its soluble form it may be a new factor to counteract the spread of coronavirus by limiting the binding of coronavirus to the cell membrane or entry of the virus as well as its proliferation in infected individuals batlle et al 2020 viral replication in the presence of ace2 the most efficient approach for extensive vaccine production in addition recently recognized early spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 is an important factor for entryviral spread of 2019ncov through interaction with the ace2 receptor moreover soluble ace2 may competitively bind with 2019ncov and survive cellular ace2 activity which negatively normalizes the ras to protect the lung from damage through weakening viral entry into cells also a viral expansion to protect the lung from injury ace2 fused to an immunoglobulin fc domain providing a neutralizing antibody help to avoid any viral escape while also recruit the immune system to shape lasting immune respaces kruse 2020 smith 2008 h zhang et al 2020 2019ncov outbreak from wuhan china offered a respiratory viral pandemic that currently there are no effective therapies for this infection despite a crucial need to find options to help these patients and prevent potential death for this reason vaccine research should be pursued intensely until the infection can be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019ncov infection despite the different treatments used by different countries to treat covid19 it is clear that the use of these drugs alone will not produce the desired results and some drugs will cause side effects in certain groups of people for example excessive use of chloroquine is toxic and can even be fatal or the use of favipiravir in pregnant women is not recommended as it is associated with teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in animals or corticosteroids that are immunosuppressive and are not recommended for mild or early ards because early use of corticosteroids can delay the clearance of the virus and increase the risk of death longterm administration of high doses of corticosteroids in the early stages of treatment has negative effects generally corticosteroids should be avoided unless the patient has symptoms such as moderate or severe ards sepsis or septic shock mpa also has no effective inhibitory effect on sarscov so they are not recommended for treatment lopinavir is associated with side effects such as digestive adverse effects and hypokalemia that should be considered by physicians the use of neuraminidase inhibitors is also invalid due to resistance to ncov2019 and is not recommended for the treatment of patients however the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis is appropriate because it blocks the entry of the virus and prevents virus replication and remdesivir has extensive antiviral activity against coronaviruses therefore the appropriate recommendation for the treatment of patients with covid19 is a combination of existing drugs ifn2b together with ribavirin when used for the treatment of merscov showed that their effective dose was decreased compared to the singledose regimen and betterstimulated cytokine release and inflammatory responses and decreased viral replication modulated host response and improved clinical outcomes ribavirin plus lopinavirritonavir in patients with sarscov reduces ards and mortality and in patients with sarscov who receive corticosteroids with ribavirin lopinavirritonavir their ards and mortality significantly decreased lopinavir also has a stronger antiviral effect than the lpvr and the combination of arbidol and lpvr is more effective than lpvr in addition to these drugs if ace2 is presented in its soluble form as a suitable recombinant protein it may be a new factor in counteracting the spread of coronavirus as well as its proliferation in infected individuals another possible treatment option could be the use of serums that are obtained from the blood of patients infected with the new coronavirus during their recovery and also targeting the cellular components involved in the hosts inflammatory response to the virus is also a good way of targeting viral damage by targeting a cellular protein all the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests m e investigated and

version of the manuscript  characterization and treatment of sars-cov-2 in nasal and bronchial human airway epithelia andrs pizzorno1 blandine padey1 thomas julien1 sophie trouillet-assant1  in the current covid-19 pandemic context proposing and validating effective treatments represents a major challenge however the lack of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of sars-cov-2 infection as a complement of classic cell lines represents a 35 major barrier for scientific and medical progress here we advantageously used human reconstituted airway epithelial models of nasal or bronchial origin to characterize viral infection kinetics tissue-level remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure and transcriptional immune signatures induced by sars-cov-2 our results underline the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates foremost we provide evidence on the antiviral 40 efficacy of remdesivir and the therapeutic potential of the remdesivir-diltiazem combination as a rapidly available option to respond to the current unmet medical need imposed by covid-19  on dec 31 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in wuhan china on jan 10 2020 a novel coronavirus lately named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and classified into the betacoronavirus genus was 50 identified as the causative agent 1  as of mar 20 2020 9 days after the world health organization who declared the covid-19 a pandemic 2  the new coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 had caused approximately 8 800 deaths among more than 210 000 confirmed cases reported mainly in china but also spreading to at least 168 other countries or territories worldwide 3 compared to the two other coronaviruses responsible for epidemic outbreaks in the past 55 sars-cov and mers-cov the novel sars-cov-2 strain shares 79 and 50 genome sequence identity respectively 4  not surprisingly important differences in terms of the epidemiology and physiopathology between these three viruses have also been observed 5 6 7  as with most emerging viral diseases no specific antiviral treatment nor vaccine against any of these three coronaviruses are currently available with standard patient management relying 60 mainly on symptom treatment and respiratory support when needed in that regard and considering that key features of the biology of sars-cov-2 and its induced covid-19 still require further characterization the scarce readiness of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of sars-cov-2 infection as a complement of the african green monkey veroe6 cell line represents a major barrier for scientific and medical progress in this area we and others have previously 65 reported the advantage of using more physiological models such as in-house or commercially available reconstituted human airway epithelia hae to isolate culture and study a wide range of respiratory viruses 8 9  developed from biopsies of nasal or bronchial cells differentiated in the airliquid interphase these models reproduce with high fidelity most of the main structural functional and innate immune features of the human respiratory epithelium that play a central role 70 in the early stages of infection and constitute robust surrogates to study airway disease mechanisms and for drug discovery 10  in this study we initially isolated and amplified in veroe6 cells a sars-cov-2 virus directly form a nasal swab from one of the first hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19 in france 11  the complete genome sequence of the isolated sars-cov-2 virus was deposited 75 in the gisaid epicovtm database under the reference betacovfranceidf05712020 accession id epiisl411218 phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the isolated virus is representative of currently circulating strains 12  we first characterized the replicative capacities of this viral strain in veroe6 cells at different multiplicities of infection mois fig 1a  using both classic infectious titer determination in cell culture tcid50 and molecular semi-quantitative 80 methods the latter based on orf1b-nsp14-specific primers and probes designed by the school of public healthuniversity of hong kong details in supplementary materials this double approach was facilitated by the appearance of clearly observable characteristic cytopathic effect from 48 hpi fig 1b  and enabled the validation of a large interval range 1-8 log10tcid50 with high correlation r-squared 094 between molecular and infectious viral titers fig 1c  85 in parallel we successfully inoculated nasal mucilair hae on the apical surface directly with nasal swab samples as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations fig   s1  characteristic features of coronavirus-induced cell ultrastructure remodeling were easily distinguishable in both the apical and basal sides of the hae at 48 hpi notably the high accumulation of progeny virions in mucus-producer goblet cells then we advantageously 90 exploited the mucilair hae model and in-house adapted protocols previously optimized for different respiratory viruses 13 to perform experimental infections with sars-cov-2 viral replication was monitored through repeated sampling and tcid50 titration at the apical surface of hae fig 1d  trans-epithelial electrical resistance teer considered as a surrogate of epithelium integrity was also measured during the time-course of infection fig 1e  in parallel 95 comparative molecular viral genome quantification was performed at the three levels of the airliquid hae interphase in apical washes fig 1f apical  total cellular rna fig 1g  intracellular and basal medium fig 1h basal  sars-cov-2 viral production at the epithelial apical surface increased sharply at 48 hpi reaching 58 and 63 log10 tcid50ml in nasal and bronchial hae respectively the peak of viral replication was reached earlier in bronchial 48-72 100 hpi than in nasal hae in which a progressive increase in infectious viral titers was observed until at least 96 hpi fig 1d  this replication kinetics was validated by molecular viral genome quantification at the apical pole  fig 1f  high viral replication correlated with a reduction in epithelium integrity at 48 hpi reflected by more than 28-and 4-fold decreases in bronchial and nasal hae teer values respectively followed by a partial recovery in the case of bronchial hae 105 fig 1e  moreover viral production at the apical pole was well correlated with intracellular viral genome detection during infection except for the nasal hae at 48 hpi in which a strong relative increase of nsp14 rna was observed fig 1f  interestingly viral genome was detected in the basal medium from 48 hpi with the peak observed at 72 hpi  fig 1h  coinciding with the highest impact of sars-cov-2 infection on epithelium integrity 110 to further characterize the biology of the sars-cov-2 we inoculated both nasal  fig   2a  b and bronchial fig 2c d hae and analyzed the infection-induced remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy at 48 hpi both hae exhibited a well-established infection with ciliated goblet and to a lesser extent basal cells showing active production of viral progeny this observation is accordance with viral replication results described in fig 1 and with a recent study reporting high expression levels of the sars-cov-2 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 in both ciliated and goblet respiratory cells 14  as previously observed in structural studies of other coronaviruses notably sars-cov and mers-cov 15-18 we distinguished characteristic clusters in the perinuclear region of infected hae cells these clusters are mainly composed of numerous viral single-and double-membrane 120 vesicles dmv and mitochondria  fig 2a a1 we therefore evaluated in both veroe6 and hae model the antiviral potential against sars-cov-2 of remdesivir monotherapy but also in combination with diltiazem diltiazem is a voltage gated 170 ca2 channel antagonist currently used as anti-hypertensive for the control of angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmia 26  which we have recently repurposed as an effective host-directed influenza inhibitor due to its so far undescribed capacity of inducing the interferon ifn antiviral response particularly type iii ifns fig s2 8  additionally the rationale of testing such virus-directed plus host-directed drug combination is consistent with a novel study describing hypertension as a 175 potential risk factor observed among a cohort of inpatients with covid-19 19 and two reports not anticipating potential adverse effects of diltiazem 27 or negative pharmacological interactions of between remdesivir and diltiazem for the treatment of covid-19 28  cells has been proved functional this cell line cannot produce type i ifns 29 30  this incomplete ifn response most likely accounts for the lack of significant antiviral effect observed with diltiazem monotherapy in our experimental conditions nonetheless addition of 115 m diltiazem significantly potentiated the antiviral effect of remdesivir  fig 4a-c  inducing 68 and 50 185 reductions in remdesivir ic50 values at 48 and 72 hpi respectively comparably daily treatment with 20 m remdesivir resulted in 73 log10 and 79 log10 reductions of intracellular sars-cov-2 viral titers at 48 hpi in nasal and bronchial hae respectively fig 4d upper panel  not surprisingly for a model with a completely functional ifn response daily treatment with 90 m diltiazem resulted in moderate yet substantial 04 log10 and 08 log10 respectively reductions of 190 intracellular viral titers in nasal and bronchial hae at the same time-point fig 4d upper panel  on top of that we observed an additional 13 log10 reduction in nasal hae viral titers for the remdesivir-diltiazem combination when compared with remdesivir monotherapy in all cases the antiviral effects induced by remdesivir diltiazem or the remdesivir-diltiazem combination translated into a protection of the nasal but not the bronchial hae barrier integrity preventing the 195 drop on teer values induced by the infection fig 4d lower panel  importantly remdesivir also showed a strong antiviral effect at 72 hpi fig 4e upper panel  this time the 2 log10 reductions in nasal and bronchial hae viral titers observed for the remdesivir and remdesivirdiltiazem treatments correlated higher teer values in both hae compartments fig 4e   emergence of novel coronavirus and progress toward treatment and vaccine muhammad khan muzamil amna noor asadullah madni mudassir shafiq   coronaviruses are a form of positivestrand nonsegmented rna viruses distributed among birds mammals and humans that cause respiratory and neurological illnesses
1
 there are six different types that can cause disease among humans four of these hku1 229e nl63 and oc43 cause only the common cold in patients
2
 while two others cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscoronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov
3
 sarscov caused severe respiratory illness in china during its outbreak in 20022003
4
 while the merscov outbreak started in the middle east in 2012
5
 due to the broad genetic variation and diversity of coronaviruses and higher chances of animal to human spread they are likely to emerge periodically in future
6

 during december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonialike symptoms occurred in patients that were linked to the seafood market in wuhan china
7
 investigation identified a new strain of coronavirus called sarscov2
8

 the detection of this novel coronavirus is key to confirm the cases and proceed to treatment in an early method for detecting sarscov2 the samples from bronchoalveolarlavage fluids were collected centrifuged to remove debris and inoculated onto human epithelial cells of airway origin
9
 about 20 000 sequences from each sample were obtained and genome matches showed more than 85 identity with sarslike betacornavirus results were also obtained from realtime pcr and isolated viruses were named sarscov2
8
 to further characterize sarscov2 the denovo sequence was obtained by using nanopore sequencing and illumina methods the airway epithelial cell cultures were suitable for visualization and identification of the novel coronavirus
9

 the nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin favipiravir galidesivir and remdesivir target rna polymerase and block the synthesis of viral rna
10
 favipiravir was effectively used against influenza and has the potential to inhibit viral rna synthesis and a new study also supports its activity against sarscov2
11
 different clinical trials are underway where patients are being recruited to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of favipiravir and interferon
12
 and a combination of favipiravir and baloxavir marboxil is being evaluated
13
 ribavirin is a guanine derivative antiviral drug approved for the treatment of hcv and rsv but it causes anemia at higher doses that limit its use and its efficacy against coronavirus is uncertain
14

 remdesivir is an adenine derivative antiviral drug it has activity against a variety of viral strains such as sars and mers and a recent study also supports its activity against sarscov2
11
 a recent patient in us with sarscov2 has shown recovery with intravenous administration of remdesivir
15
 recently phaseiii clinical trials have been started in usa to evaluate the efficacy of iv remdesivir as 200 mg od or 100 mg od for 9 days
16
 a recent rct apparently reported no significant efficacy but we await the published findings some protease inhibitors like lopinavirand ritonavir have shown activity against sars and mers coronaviruses
17
 
18
 clinical trials have been started to test the efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir combination against sarscov2 these drugs are known to inhibit the chymotrypsinlike protease of mers and sars coronaviruses
19
 a study in vitro using vero e6 cells infected with sarscov2 assessed efficacy of different therapies by quantitative analysis using pcr qrtpcr remdesivir and chloroquine showed promising results remdesivir has previously shown efficacy against mers coronavirus and ebola virus and is currently under clinical trial for treatment of ebola the results showed that ec90 value of remdesivir against sarscov2 was 176 m
15

 neuraminidase inhibitors are recognized antiviral agents for the treatment of influenza the treatment with oral oseltamivir has been given to suspected patients in china in past oseltamivir has shown efficacy against merscov
20

 small molecular weight drugs such as chloroquine have shown inhibitory effects against sarscov2 ec50  114 m in vero e6 cells and is under evaluation in openlabel trials
15
 chloroquine cq is a recognized antimalarial drug but also has antiviral activity the antiviral activity of chloroquine was first noticed in the late 1960s
21
 chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine both have inhibitory effects against various viruses including sars
22
 enterovirus
23
 and zika virus
24
 chloroquine inhibits the virus by increasing endosomal ph and so reducing viral cell fusion and also interferes with cellular receptor glycosylation
25
 the ec90 value of chloroquine against sarscov2 is 690 m that can be achieved with administration of 500 mg dose
26
 remdesivir and chloroquine have shown activity in in vitro studies and can easily be tested in patients with sarscov2
15

 in another recent study gao et al found that chloroquine phosphate reduced the symptoms of pneumonia in sarscov2 patients and shortening the duration of disease
27
 the guidelines for the treatment of sarscov2 were revised six times since its issuance on 15 january 2020 the recent guidelines also include ifn remdesivir ribavirin ritonavir and chloroquine the mode of administration of ifn is through inhalation at a dose of 5 million units diluted with water for injection the dose of ritonavir is 100 mg bd for adults ribavirin may be given in combination with ifn or ritonavir at a dose of 500 mg bd or tds chloroquine phosphate should be administered at a dose of 500 mg bd arbidol can be given three times a day at 200 mg
28

 hydroxychloroquine hcq is an approved diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug that also has immunomodulatory effects and prevents organ damage
29
 hcq alters endosomal ph and interrupts the biding between rnadna and tolllike receptors that leads to suppression of tlr signaling
30
 
31
 
32
 inside the cytoplasm hcq also interferes with the interaction between nucleic acid sensor cyclic gmp and cytosolic dna
33
 these two mechanisms lead to increase production of il1 tnf and type1 interferon such mechanism supports the idea that hcq suppress the cytokine release storm crs which is due to sarscov2 triggered overreaction of immune system
34
 in a recent study hcq was found to be more effective than chloroquine a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily and maintenance dose of 200 mg twice a day is recommended for sarscov2 infection
35

 the mechanism involves in antiviral role of hcq and cq is inhibition of receptor binding and fusion of cell membrane these two are crucial steps that are required for cell entry of sarscov2 chloroquine interferes with the glycosylation of ace2 angiotensinconverting enzyme receptors receptors that are considered as cellular receptors for sarscov2 and block the fusion of sarscov2 with host cell thus the binding of virus is blocked and infection is prevented the hcq and cq after entry into the cell tend to concentrate in lysosomes and endosomes the sarscov2 use endosome as a tool for cellular entry hcq and cq increase the ph of endosomes and create a negative influence on the binding of sarsc0v2 with endosomes
25
 lysosomal protease helps in viral fusion with cell membrane increase lysosomal ph prevents the action of protease and fusion and replication of virus is blocked
36
  the mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is represented as figure 1 cinanserin is an antagonist of serotonin receptors it can inhibit chymotrypsinlike 3clike protease and has shown promising results against sars coronavirus
37
 the 3cprotease was also investigated to be encoded in sarscov2
38

 flavonoids such as chalcones flavones and isoflavones produce antioxidant effects but they also have antiviral effects
39
 a study has found that flavonoids can inhibit the entry of hepatitisc virus
40
 some flavonoids have activity against mers coronavirus presumably due to inhibition of 3clike protease
41

 pirfenidone is under clinical trial for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis resulting from sarscov2 infection it also has an antiinflammatory effect and serves as an antioxidant the results obtained during sars 2003 were promising and now beneficial effects could be obtained in patients with severe pneumonia from sarscov2
42

 nitric oxide no is a biological gas produced from arginine no after reaction with superoxide forms peroxynitrite which has cytotoxic bactericidal action
43
 nitric oxide is also known to regulate airway function and reduce inflammation of airways
44
 the beneficial effect of no in sars patients was observed in some studies
45
 no can also inhibit the synthesis of rna and viral protein
46
 a study has found that organic nitric oxide could inhibit the replication cycle of sarscov2
47

 lphalipoic acid ala is used in hepatic disorders and polyneuropathies
48
 ala is an antioxidant that protects cells against oxidative stress by increasing the glutathione level
49
 it was reported that individual oxidative stress plays a role in coronavirus infection and g6llpd deficiency was a crucial factor in sarscov2 patients
50
 so ala could be an option to decrease the oxidative stress in patients with sarscov2 infection mucroporinm1 is a peptide derived from scorpion venom with broad spectrum antiviral activity against various infections like influenza h5n1 and sarscov
51

 the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of sarscov2 is also under consideration with varying hope regarding efficacy the pros of using plasma from recovered patients include easy availability and it can also be used as prophylactically in healthcare professionals who are at high risk of exposure to sarscov2 infection the cons include that not all recovered patients have enough antibodies lack of availability of validated sarscov2 assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies may cause hindrance in identification of suitable donor
52
 a large scale randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of convalescent plasma
53

 some studies support the role of angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors this is based on the hypothesis that ace2 serves as receptor for sarscov2
54
 
55
 so ace inhibitor could potentially compete for site binding and reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with sarscov2
56

 the various ongoing clinical trials are summarized in table 1 the fusion of coronavirus with a cell occurs after biding of s protein to a target receptor delivers viral nucleocapsid and initiates replication the s protein causes syncytial formation at the receptor site
85
 a neutralizing antibody that can target the s protein on the surface of sarscov2 could also be an option to produce passive immunity in patients
86
 recent research on the genome of sarscov2 mn9089473 allows scientists to express the s protein as immunogen on the surface and explore options such as yeast libraries for generating antibodies that neutralize the virus

 like other coronaviruses these are spherical shaped containing genetic material inside and with spike proteins protruding from their surface which helps to latch onto the human cell followed by fusion and transfer of genes to the host cell the latest data shows that like the virus that caused the 2002 sars outbreak sars-cov-2 spikes bind to receptors on the human cell surface called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace211 this latest virus can develop respiratory tract infections in the patients range from mild to fatal illnesses like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the majority of the patients will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover with supportive treatment and do not need any special caretreatment geriatric patients and patients with comorbidities like diabetes cardiovascular chronic respiratory disorders cancer immunodeficiency patients and other chronic disorders are more prone to develop serious pathological issues related to covid-193
 symptoms may appear after 214 days based on mers-cov virus data of infection which includes fever cough shortness of breath trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new confusion or inability to arouse and bluish lips or face covid-19 is also associated with mental and neurological manifestations including delirium or encephalopathy agitation stroke meningo-encephalitis impaired sense of smell or taste anxiety depression and sleep problems multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adults is also observed in some cases12

13 unfortunately three types of extra pulmonary complications were reported by the covid19 patients includes liver injury as that of other corona infections sars and mers and fulminant myocarditis and acute kidney injury14 15 16
 as of now the exact effective drug vaccine or any therapeutic procedure is not available and experiments are underway however empiric therapy is being practiced to manage and saves the life of the patient with the known antivirals antibiotics corticosteroids biological and traditional preparations either alone or in combination based on the patients condition signs symptoms and severity need and availability along with other supportive therapies for managing any disease early identification of the disease and assessment of associated risk factors modifiablenonmodifiable is paramount secondly supportive care which includes curative therapy if available symptomatic therapy as sars-cov-2 virus belongs to the sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov prescribers are administering the drugs which have shown some promising results in managing similar viral infections17
 healthcare systems of different countries have suggested few drugs based on the preliminary data obtained through uncontrolled studies national health commission of the peoples republic of china has recommended favipiravir chloroquine phosphate plasma transfusion therapy remdesivir and traditional chinese medicine18
 the indian council of medical research icmr new delhi has recommended hydroxychloroquine for empirical use for prophylactic purposes in asymptomatic healthcare workers and household contacts of laboratory confirmed patients19
 according to the guidelines given by the government of india ministry of health  family welfare directorate general of health services emergency medical relief emr division lopinavirritonavir can be given only after proper informed expressed consent from the patient and ensuring all necessary monitoring measures to avoid possible serious adverse reactions20
 spanish society of hospital pharmacy for the management of antiviral treatment in the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 disease covid-19 guidelines has recommended lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir oral  interferon alfa-2b and beta-1b remdesivir hydroxychloroquine chloroquine darunavircobicistat tocilizumab21

22
 there are no us food and drug administration fda-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with covid-19 centers for disease control and prevention have provided information about the currently recommended drugs in the united states ie chloroquine hydroxychloroquine remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir23
 as per the data available on 22052020 in nih us national library of medicine clinicaltrialgov 977 interventional clinical trials for covid-19 are currently at various stages of development throughout the world of them 11 drug intervention trials on das181 hydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir interferon beta-1a and 1 b baricitinib 4 mg methylprednisolone ganovo danoprevirritonavir  interferon nebulization ribavirin were completed but no results were posted on the website24

 according to the data obtained from the uppsala monitoring centre umc-global adverse reactions reporting system as on 22052020 only 24 adrs were reported34 the cost of the drug is not found with our extensive search and the global commercial availability of this drug is very less currently there are 17 clinical trials specific to covid-19 are at various phases of development and researchers are expecting promising results in clearing the virus35
 recently a reputed pharmaceutical company has initiated phase-3 clinical trials for covid-19 in india with tablet favipiravir and it is expecting the complete study results by august36
 preclinical data from various studies has confirmed the role of chloroquine in controlling the human coronavirus infection through different mechanisms which includes through protease inhibition in sarscov inhibition of sialic acid biosynthesis inhibition of hcov-oc43 replication in hrt-18 cells by chloroquine in newborn mice the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk and extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk in human coronavirus 229e infection in human epithelial lung cells inhibition of viral spread in cell culture through endosomal ph rise and interfering with terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor inhibition of the replication of sars-cov in vero e6 cells6

 in 2020 docking study results of wu c et al44 predicted the possibility of combining with nsp3b and e-channel and further and also supported the potentiality of the chloroquine to become a therapeutic option for covid-19 infection zhang s et al45 and colson p et al46 also stated that the alkalization of phagolysosome and slowdowns the ph-dependent viral replication including fusion and uncoating and they also commented as chloroquine is both a safe and economic drug than others at this current junction for both prophylactic and curative treatment of novel coronavirus infection chloroquine phosphate tablet 500 mg 12 hourly for 10 days might have benefits in controlling the novel coronavirus pneumonia irrespective of their severity47 in other studies conducted on covid-19 patients researchers have found the superiority of chloroquine over other therapy in terms of both efficacy and safety in reducing the exacerbation of pneumonia46

48 with the support of this data chinese government recommended chloroquine along with other therapies for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 pneumonia18
 the american academy of ophthalmology stated that risk of toxicity with the usage of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine is dose and duration dependent with the normal daily dose for less than 5 years therapy has 1 chance of retinopathy however regular monitoring is required to prevent retinopathy39

49 a total of 6189 adrs were reported to umc sweden of which 1873 were skin and subcutaneous disorders 1676 were gastrointestinal disorders 1447 were nervous system disorders and 738 were eye disorders34
 this drug is widely available globally in all the areas at affordable prices the cost range of 250 mg tablets is 035 usd tablet is 542785 usd in india it is available in a variety of formulations for all age groups ie drops injection tablet syrup etc at very low cost and the cost of 10 ml drops 80 mgml is 705 inr 2 ml 80 mg ampoule is 365 inr the cost of each 250 mg tablet is 050 inr to 10 inr and 500 mg is 125 inr to 20 inr and syrup 60 ml is 1150 inr to 150inr50
 currently a total of 67 clinical trials are underway with chloroquine for the management of covid-1951
 literature confirms that both the cq and hcq have similar properties and acts in the same way with minor changes in their dosing schedule researchers also said that the hcq is their first choice in treating the sars-cov-2 infection as hcq is showing less toxicity 40 in animals than chloroquine46

54
 an in-vitro study conducted by yao x et al55 using sars-cov-2 infected vero cells concluded that the hcq ec50  072 m at an oral loading dose of 400 mg 12th hourly followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 days is better than chloroquine ec50  547 m 500 mg 12th hourly for 5 days for treating sars-cov-2 infection they also quoted that the immunomodulatory effects of these two drugs can suppress the raised immune factors cytokines il-6 and il-10 as an immune response to sars-cov-2 virus and prevents the complications christophe b et al56 studied the antiviral activity of ferroquine fq derivatives hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in viruses infecting vero cell cultures where they found the better inhibitory activity of hydroxychloroquine than chloroquine cq the revised advisory report of the joint monitoring group under the chairmanship of dghs on the safety and efficacy of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine hcq in india has drawn the following conclusions from the clinical studies-a significant dose-response relationship was observed between the number of prophylactic doses taken and frequency of occurrence of sarscov-2 infection in symptomatic healthcare workers-the probability of sarscov-2 infection in healthcare workers who have taken the prophylactic hcq was less when compared to those who have not taken-another study conducted at aiims new delhi on prophylaxis hcq median 6 weeks of follow up had reported the lower incidence of this infection in healthcare workers
 they have also assessed the safety of hcq prophylaxis among 1323 healthcare workers and found mild adverse effects such as nausea 89 abdominal pain 73 vomiting 15 hypoglycemia 17 and cardio-vascular effects 1957
 recently magagnoli j et al58 have conducted retrospective analysis of 368 sarscov-2 infection in-patients in united states and they concluded that the use of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin has not proven the efficacy in controlling the infection however the mortality rate was more in patients administered with hydroxychloroquine alone the authors have also stated the need of sufficient data to widespread use of these drugs mehra mr et al59 have analyzed the multinational registry of 96032 of covid-19 in-patients who were admitted during december 20 2019 to april 14 2020 a total of 14888 patients were received hydroxychloroquine orand chloroquine with or without a macrolide along with other treatments authors have not found the any evidence of benefit with these drugs in-spite they noted the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with covid-19 results of this analysis suggested to not to use these drug regimens without clinical evidence the risk of toxicity with the usage of hcq is dose and duration dependent with a normal daily dose for less than 5 years therapy has a 1 chance of retinopathy they recommend a maximum daily dose which can lead to this toxicity is 50 mgkg for hcq but with cq damage may occur at 23 mgkg weight but the duration of the therapy may not be longer in controlling covid-19 so there is a less possibility of developing retinopathy49 no significant elevation of liver enzymes and liver injury with the hcq is rare in normal individuals but it may alter the metabolism of co-administered drugs60
 a total 23994 adrs were reported to umc sweden on hcq of which general disorders and administration site conditions 10232 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 5802 gastrointestinal disorders 4207 musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 3385 nervous system disorders 2658 and eye disorders 2118 are commonly affected systems34
 it is available in different strengths ie 100 mg 200 mg 300 mg and 400 mg tablets the cost of hcq ranges from for 400 mg 10 inr to 16 inr for 300 mg 11 inr to 14 inr for 200 mg 5 inr to 10 inr61
 to date 201 hcq clinical trials are being conducted with or without other treatments in different parts of the world and are at different stages of development for prophylaxis and treatment of mild moderate and severe sars-cov-2 infections of 201 trials 5 were completed and expecting defined guidelines for the use of hcq in covid-19 patients with more scientific evidence62
 due to its safety profile availability and low cost and efficacy most of the prescribers are advising this drug in their covid-19 patients and as prophylaxis for non-infected healthcare workers covid19 patients exposed people in recent days after the announcement of potential beneficial effects with rational use by some organizations and famous persons the irrational purchase of the cq and hcq has increased enormously this led to the shortage of these drugs for chronic inflammatory diseases in some cases irrational use leads to poisoning63

64
 philippe gautret et al65 have studied the efficacy of hcq in combination with azithromycin 22 confirmed covid-19 patients received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and depending on their clinical presentation azithromycin was added to the treatment a significant reduction of the viral load was observed on day 6 when compared to controls they concluded that hydroxychloroquine treatment had significantly reduced the viral load in covid19 patients and its effect was synergized with azithromycin researchers are investigating the efficacy of this combination in various countries with or without other drugs62
 preclinical studies conducted by researchers have demonstrated the antiviral activity through various mechanisms against coronaviruses like mers and sars which are structurally similar to sars-cov-2 dong l et al29 reported that the remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue with potential and broad-spectrum antiviral activity wang m et al2 concluded that remdesivir acts through incorporation into nascent viral rna chains and results in premature termination at a stage post virus entry in rna viruses including sarsmerscov in 2020 timothy p s et al67 observed a potent inhibition in mers-cov replication with ec50 of 009 m with no observable cytotoxicity up to 10 m in primary human lung epithelial cell cultures tchesnokov e p et al68 have demonstrated delayed chain termination in the ebola virus hiv-1 and the hepatitis b virus cell cultures agostini m l et al69 has identified the efficacy of remdesivir in targeting the proofreading exoribonuclease through the incorporation of the active triphosphate into viral rna sheahan t p et al70 said that the nucleotide pro-drug remdesivir has shown inhibitory properties against sars-cov and mers-cov replication in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures also it has demonstrated the broad-spectrum anti-cov activity in circulating contemporary human cov in primary human lung cells it has reduced the viral load significantly in both prophylactic and therapeutic use in a mouse model against sars-cov authors have opinioned that this drug has a strong potential to become a therapeutic option for cov in the future emmie de wit et al71 have reported the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir gs-5734 use in the rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection lo m k et al72 have also reported the efficacy of remdesivir in a variety of viruses including coronaviruses elfiky a et al73 stated that remdesivir along with other antiviral binds to the new coronavirus strain rdrp tightly rather than the polymerase they also suggest gtp as one of the targets in inhibiting sars-cov-2 according to the report by abby olena74 remdesivir mimics adenosine one of the building blocks of any rna viruss genome can interfere with the rna-dependent rna polymerase holshue m l et al75 have reported the first case of a 35-year-old man who was confirmed with novel covid-19 intravenous remdesivir was initiated from the evening of day 7 as the patients condition was worsen and continued till the discharge day 0n 11th day the viral loads were decreased in respiratory fluid specimens are on the 12th day specimen tested negative for 2019-ncov and the patients clinical condition was improved and no adverse events were observed in association with the remdesivir infusion they also mentioned the need for extensive clinical investigation on the usage of remdesivir a news report by suryatapa bhattacharya76 in the wall street journal revealed that the 14 american cruise passengers in japan who contracted the novel coronavirus were treated effectively with the antiviral drug remdesivir international pharmaceutical federation and american society of health-system pharmacists ashp have stated the importance of remdesivir in treating covid-19 in their treatment guidelines for covid-19 and they also mentioned that this drug is under evaluation in different clinical trials77

78
 a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial at ten hospitals in hubei china on 237 covid 19 patients remdesivir in a dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 210 in single daily infusions was given in158 patients and remaining were received placebo they also received lopinavirritonavir interferon and corticosteroids as and when the non statistical significant clinical improvement at a faster time was observed with remdesivir the incidence of adverse effects was similar in two groups ie 66  and 64 respectively remdesivir was withdrawn from 18 12 patients study findings revealed that dose regimen was well tolerated but no significant efficacy was observed in seriously ill patients however reduction in some clinical parameters was observed authors concluded the need of vigorous research with this drug is needed to confirm its benefits in larger population79
 a total of 74 adrs were reported to umc sweden of which majority were related to the investigations 28 followed by renal and urinary disorders 14 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 14 infections and infestations 11 and respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders 934 the cost of the remdesivir 1 mg is usd 220 and 5 mg usd 55080 as of now this drug is not widely available globally currently 24 clinical trials are being conducted to know the efficacy of remdesivir in covid-19 patients of them 1 trial was completed some uncontrolled studies are showing some clinical evidence and may expect the same with these clinical trials and this may become a potential treatment option for covid-19 patients81
 though it is effective in combating covid-19 its limited availability and high cost becomes challenge so governments and researchers have to take necessary actions to overcome these issues chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro and a papain-like protease plpro are important for the replication of sars-cov these proteases are important targets for the development of antiviral drugs in-vitroanimal studies conducted in 2020 have revealed the inability of this drug to bind to major targets like 3clpro plpro rdrp and a comparative study between the remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir lpvrtv and interferon-beta ifn-b against mers-cov in mice found slight reduction in viral loads and improved the pulmonary function but not reduced the viral replication or severe lung pathology68

 according to the case report published by han w et al83 this combination has shown efficacy in a 47 years old male sarscov-2 patient in 800200 mg dose along with methylprednisolone 40 mg for 2 days only recombinant human interferon alfa-2b 10 million iu per day patient was recovered on the 10th day and tested negative for the virus and discharged in chen q et al84 case series lopinavir and ritonavir tablets 800200 mg daily were given to 9 patients along with other treatments based on the severity all the patients become negative for sars-cov-2 range 411 treatment days the average days of hospital stay were 142 range from 9 to 20 for the recovery from the lung lesions as well as from the clinical symptoms fortunately no deaths were reported during the treatment period and authors concluded that effective treatment should include the combination of traditional chinese and western medicine b cao et al85 have conducted a randomized controlled open-label trial on 199 sars-cov-2 infected adult patients with the median age of 58 4968 years patients were randomized into two groups ie 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group the dose of 400 mg and 100 mg 12th hourly for 14 days and 100 to the standard care group they have observed a similar reduction in the viral loads from day 1 to day 28 in both groups adverse events were monitored up to 28 days and found 46 adrs in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 49 in the standard group gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group but serious adverse events were more common in the standard care group drug discontinuation was observed in 13 patients of the lopinavirritonavir group due to these safety issues the authors conclude that there was no difference observed in the outcomes of both groups this suggests further evaluation to confirm the benefits of lopinavir-ritonavir a total 10786 adrs reported to umc sweden of which the majority were related to injury gastrointestinal disorders 3117 followed by general disorders and administration site conditions 1913 injury poisoning and procedural complications 1544 investigations 1483 metabolism and nutrition disorders 1267 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 1189 nervous system disorders 108334 the cost of this drug combination is around 100150 inr for one tablet of 400mg200 mg composition and the availability is not much86
 presently 64 clinical trials are underway on this combination along with other drug interventions and the majority at an initial stage of the development87
 based on the effectiveness in the clinical conditions rather than preclinical studies and when compared to other anti-viral drugs cost and availability this drug has the possibility of becoming an effective treatment option for covid-19 based on the docking study results of 2020 wu c et al43 this drug might be a potent sars-plpro inhibitor as it bound to the active site of the enzyme with low energy an extensive review done by vincent c c c et al91 had reported that ribavirin suppresses the pro-inflammatory response while augmenting viral replication in this mouse model and it has shown activity in human caco-2 and pig kidney cell lines but failed to show effects in vero cells ning q et al92 study reported the immunomodulatory effects of ribavirin ie inhibiting the production of il-4 by th2 cells and positive effect on interferons in th1 cells in both in-vitro and in-vivo it also inhibits macrophage proinflammatory cytokines and th2 cytokines while preserving th1 cytokines sun d et al93 have reported the efficacy of ribavirin along with other medications in pediatric patients with lower case fatality rate than adults in kenneth w et al94 study a total of 10 severe acute respiratory syndromes sars patients with an average age 525  110 years were treated empirically with ribavirin 8 mg per kilogram of body weight every eight hours or oral ribavirin 12 g every eight hours in patient 4 only and intravenous corticosteroids hydrocortisone at a dose of 4 mg per kilogram every eight hours tapered to 200 mg every eight hours or methylprednisolone at a dose of 240320 mg daily out of 10 patients only one patient got discharged with complete recovery by the 20th day of admission 7 patients were unwell even after 1833 days of admission and the remaining 2 were died a retrospective study was conducted by booth cm et al95 on 144 sars patients with the median age of 45 3457 years where ribavirin loading dose of 2 g iv followed by 1 g iv every 6 h for 4 days followed by 500 mg every 8 h for 3 days was given to 126 patients with a median of 6 57 days treatment days by 14th day majority 74 of the patients got recovered and discharged but the safety issues warns the prescribers to monitor the patients closely around 50 were developed hemolysis and low hemoglobin and in 18 patients the drug was discontinued due to the toxicity they have also reported 8 deaths leong h n et al96 have reported that out of 229 sars cases 97 424 were received ribavirin for mean days of 56 at a dose of 12 g three times a day in either oral or intravenous routes 10 patients have died and anemia was observed in 24 patients they conclude ribavirin should be given along with other therapies like immune therapy in a study conducted by peiris jsm et al97 75 sars confirmed patients were treated with 8 mgkg intravenous ribavirin every 8 h for 14 days along with other treatment based on the patients condition improvement was seen in 46 patients 11 were stable at the condition of 18 patients was worsened and 5 were died arabi ym et al98 retrospective cohort study on 349 mers critically ill patients reported that 144 413 patients have received ribavirinrifn the median age of these 144 patients was 575 years 205 patients have received other therapy the dose of the ribavirin was as per the creatinine clearance if it is 50 mlmin 2000 mg orally loading dose then 1200 mg every 8 hrs for 4 days then 600 mg po every 8 hrs for 46 days 2050 mlmin- 2000 mg orally loading dose then 600 mg every 8 hrs for 4 days 200 mg orally every 6 hrs for 46 days and in 20 mlmin and hemodialysis patients- 2000 mg orally loading dose then 200 mg every 6 hrs for 4 days then 200 mg every 12 hrs was given the average duration of therapy was 8 days rbvrifn has cleared the viral load in 28 days and another group it was found to be in 22 days 90-day mortality was more with rbvrifn 736 vs 615 in safety profile no difference was found between the two groups but rbvrifn group patients had received more blood transfusions which indicate that more number of patients from this group had developed hemolysis they concluded that rbvrifn therapy may not be effective than other therapy at the time writing this article a total 90864 adrs were reported to umc sweden of which general disorders and administration site conditions are 36378 followed by gastrointestinal disorders 22119 infections and infestations skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 20160 investigations 19020 nervous system disorders 19055 blood and lymphatic system disorders 17769 psychiatric disorders 14552 respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders 1030134
 ribavirin is available as capsules tablets and syrup in different strengths the cost of a single dose of 100 mg is ranging from inr 29003300 for 200 mg cost range is inr 56007800 and the cost of 30 ml syrup is inr 80001000099
 as on date only 8 clinical trials are being conducted by researchers on this drug of them 2 were at completed stage and report of one trial concluded that the ribavirin triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone100 101
 apart from these drugs ivermectin and nitazoxanide have also showing the some evidences of becoming promising drugs for treating the covid-19 patients ivermectin is a broad spectrum anti parasitic in 2012 it was approved for lice infestations preclinical studies recommend the ivermectins anti sars-cov-2 activity in vero-hslam cells where drug has reduced the viral rna at 48 h and impede the viral replication in bovine herpesvirus1 bohv-1 through the inhibition of dna polymerase nuclear import ivermectin also inhibits the entrance of dna polymerase ul42 into the nucleus of pseudorabies virus and its proliferation102 103 104 105
 according to the momekov g et al106 the available pharmacokinetic data of the routine doses of ivermectin may not attain the sars-cov-2 inhibitory concentrations and they are not justifying the empirical use of this drug in covid-19 patients in spite of its broad spectrum anti viral activity but they are not discouraging its use in covid-19 as on 26052020 around 14 clinical trials are at the initial stage of development either in alone or combination with other drugs for covid 19 among them majority are being conducted in combination with nitazoxanide107
 nitazoxanide is a first line broad spectrum antiviral drug and also used in influenza patients preclinical studies have reported the anti mers-cov and other coronaviruses it acts by different mechanisms ie by inhibiting n protein expression of the virus suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukin-6 production inhibition of the broad spectrum rna and dna viruses replication according to the review of pepperrell t et al a superior safety profile was observed with approved doses of nitazoxanide they have also suggested further investigation to confirm the hepatorenal cardiovascular and teratogenicity effects and opinioned the possibility of becoming a promising drug for covid-19108 109 110
 scientists have developed 3 strategies in the development of drugs to combat this deadly virus which includes-testing of the existed antiviral drugs-screening of chemical libraries against the targets and knowing their properties-discovery and development of the new molecules requires the genomic and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses though it is a promising strategy it may take around 10 years to develop one promising molecule
 as covid-19 is a pandemic disease with the high transmission rate the best strategy is to the testing of marketed antivirals empirically and developing the specific molecules based on the outcomes so this review tried to find the properties of recommended molecules for the treatment of this pandemic especially their mechanisms efficacy and safety through preclinical and clinical literature in combating coronaviruses and similar viruses cost and availability favipiravir has been recommended by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china against the sars-cov-2 virus it may acts at two stages after the virus has entered into the host cell ie inhibition of rna-dependent rna polymerase and inhibiting the incorporation of nucleotides for vrna replication and transcription some more clinical evidence on this drug is required for considering this drug the treatment of covid-19 either in alone or in combination with other drugs and it is not a widely available drug globally both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may act at different stages of the virus life cycle and interferes with the viral entry through endosomal ph rise and interfering with terminal glycosylation of ace2 receptors translation proteolysis and replication among these two hcq is may be more effective than cq though the early positive clinical outcomes less possibility of severe adverse effects might drawn the attention of the prescribers to use these drugs empirically but latest evidences are not supporting the use of these two drugs either in alone or combination and also with or without macrolide especially in curing the infection but prophylaxis use of hydroxychloroquine in indian healthcare workers has been producing the beneficial effects with mild adverse effects on 22052020 ministry of health and family welfare has reported the efficacy of prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine in healthcare workers57 in controversial to this on 25052020 in the media briefing in view of the safety concerns raised by mehra mr et al59 who has announced the temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within their solidarity trial111 this data indicates the variations in the responses of one drug in different population another promising drug is remdesivir which acts at more than one site of viral life cycle ie through incorporation into nascent viral rna chains and results in premature termination at a post virus entry stage interfere with rna dependent polymerase and inhibits the replication and targeting the proofreading exoribonuclease and acts through the incorporation of the active triphosphate into viral rna and clinical evidence in around 15 patients has shown positive results with minimal or no adverse reactions and deaths this drug has got us fda emergency use authorization in covid-19 patients and also recommended by more national healthcare organizations as a potential option against covid-19 although the in-vitro data of lopinavir-ritonavir may not support its mechanism of action ie proteolysis the clinical evidence suggests that it is an effective drug in combination with interferon as this combination has managed the more than 100 sars patients with a moderate rate of adr occurrence ribavirin acts rather than on the replication it may show immunomodulatory actions on the virus and inhibit the macrophage proinflammatory cytokines and th2 cytokines while preserving th1 cytokines among 460 coronavirus positive patients 21 of patients had developed adrs and 5 were died during treatment the preclinical and clinical data is not encouraging its use especially as mono therapy and further studies are mandatory to support its utilization in covid-19 and it has not recommended by major national healthcare organizations and the reason may be its safety concerns as of now it is early to suggest ivermectin and nitazoxanide as the available data is limited to confirm the role of these drugs in covid-19 patients and clinical trials are at initial stage apart from these drugs some other biological chemical and traditional drugs are also showing promising results in uncontrolled studies this review concludes that the drugs mentioned above are having different properties and act differently in combating the covid-19 viruses no drug may be superior or inferior however the use of single drug may not be effective enough to control this deadly virus so use of combination of antivirals with different mechanism of action may be more effective and at the same time their adverse events should not be underestimated all authors are equally contributed in data collection review and preparation of this manuscript and approved the final version for the publication we have not received any funding from government or private or any other organizations no conflicts of interest  statistical issues and lessons learned from covid-19 clinical trials with lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesivir guosheng yin chenyang zhang huaqing jin  since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 in december 2019 it has rapidly spread in more than 200 countries or territories with over 8 million confirmed cases and 440000 deaths by june 17 2020 recently three randomized clinical trials on covid-19 treatments were completed one for lopinavirritonavir and two for remdesivir one trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation however several statistical issues in the original design and analysis of the three trials are identified which might shed doubts on their findings and the conclusions should be evaluated with cautions objective from statistical perspectives we identify several issues in the design and analysis of three covid-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods  medrxiv preprint rmtrs between the remdesivir and placebo groups up to day 30 was -27 days 95 ci -40 -12 p001 confirming the superiority of remdesivir the difference in recovery time at the 25th percentile 95 ci -3 0 p65 was insignificant while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles conclusions based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on covid-19 treatments we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis for ongoing and future covid-19 trials  the lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number which led to inflation of the type i error rate the remdesivir trial of wang et al failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size moreover we used a terminal or cure rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement rmti in this context to analyze the reconstructed data due to the existence of death as competing risk and a terminal event the remdesivir trial of beigel et al reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information we reanalyzed the data to report other percentiles of the time to recovery and adopted the bootstrap method and permutation test to construct the confidence intervals as well as the p values the restricted mean time to recovery rmtr was also computed as a global and robust measure for efficacy results for the lopinavir-ritonavir trial with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199 the type i error rate was inflated from 005 to 0071 the difference of terminal rates was

eligible patients were randomized at a 11 ratio to either the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group 400 mg and 100 mg orally twice daily plus the standard care or the standard care alone for 14 days no

randomized clinical trial with a planned sample size   using a two-sided log-rank test if the hypothesis test indicates no significant survival difference between the two groups under the significance level  but the trial decides to continue to enroll more patients up to a larger sample size    this would inflate the overall type i error of the trial any adjustment to the sample size during the trial should be planned and evaluated in advance to maintain the overall type i error rate  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

survival end point we are interested in the distribution of event time   in general patients will eventually experience the event with a long enough follow-up although the exact event time might not be observed due to censoring however for some diseases with long-term survivors it may happen that the event will never occur in a fraction of subjects ie the event time for cured subjects is infinity 13 14 15 16  under this situation patients can be divided into two groups the terminal or cure group the specified event would never occur and the non-terminal group the specified event would occur but possibly censored due to the end time of the study thus the distribution of the event time  has a point probability mass where  is the group label taking a value of 1 if the individual is in the

quantify the survival difference in randomized clinical trials it is no longer an interpretable quantity if the proportional hazards ph assumption is violated 20  by contrast the rmst has the advantages of being nonparametric and model-free yet carrying clinically meaningful interpretations given the pre-specified time point   the estimate of the rmst difference between two groups can be interpreted as the extra survival gain on average during the time- followup period clinical trials during the epidemic of an infectious disease might fail to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients if the outbreak can be quickly controlled 22  however early termination of a clinical trial would inevitably lead to loss of power  in the original analysis of cao et al 7  the time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28 while failure to reach clinical improvement or death before day 28 were considered as right-censored at day 28 in contrast to the usual survival analysis where death or a bad event such as disease progression is used as the event of interest a good event clinical improvement was adopted as the end point in this trial as a result the shorter time to reach clinical improvement the better cao et al 7 concluded no benefit of using the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with an hr of 124 95 ci 090172 we carried out an in-depth and comprehensive investigation of the trial design in cao et al 7 and identified several key issues with the trial that might have hindered its success   that is the false positive rate for this trial increased as high as 71 in contrast to the nominal level of 5 any sample size alteration or re-estimation should be planned in advance in order to control the type i error rate and maintain the integrity of a trial when the sample size reached 199 the trial was halted for enrollment because of the availability of another treatment remdesivir such termination of a trial was again unplanned and immature if there were no another agent available would the trial continue recruitment interestingly the remdesivir trial  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity instead we recommend death as a single and clean end point for such trials given the mortality rate was not low with severe hospitalized covid-19 patients 192 in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 250 in the standard care group the original analysis 7 treated death before day 28 as right-censored at day 28 no matter when death had occurred this may cause ambiguity because it cannot distinguish the situations where all deaths in one group occurred earlier while those in the other group occurred later as death is a terminal event a terminal or cure rate model would be more appropriate for analysis of such data a terminal rate model can be viewed as the counterpart of the traditional mixture cure rate model 13 14 15 16  which can be developed by slight modifications as death is a terminal event patients who died during the 28-day follow-up period would never reach the clinical improvement ie the time to clinical improvement was infinity denoted as   death can also be viewed as competing risk for clinical improvement the upper panel of table 1 shows that neither was there any significant difference in the terminal rates between the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups nor in the hr after excluding the terminal subjects who would eventually be absorbed in

wang et al 8  moreover a clinical improvement might not be observed due to death ie death is a terminal event and thus the terminal or cure rate model introduced earlier should be recommended for the

et al 9 presented a preliminary report of nct04280705 trial which is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement this trial enrolled 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the primary end point of the original analysis was the recovery time defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 days 95 ci 9 12  and that of the placebo group was 15 days 95 ci 13 19 the remdesivir trial of beigel et al 9 is essential to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir as it has a large sample size of 1059 patients under a well-designed randomized controlled trial scheme in terms of the data analysis beigel et al 9 only reported the median recovery time without p value from fig 2a 9  the kaplan-meier curves of cumulative recoveries are initially intertwined and then diverge so other percentiles of the time to recovery would provide more information on the efficacy of remdesivir meanwhile a global and robust measurement the restricted mean time to recovery rmtr can help to quantify the treatment efficacy in a more comprehensive way 11 17 18 19 20 21  table 6  the restricted mean time to recovery rmtr and percentiles of the time to recovery based on the reconstructed data from fig 2a the upper panel of table 6 presents the rmtrs up to day 30 for both remdesivir and placebo groups the rmtrs were 145 days and 172 days for remdesivir and placebo respectively indicating that patients with remdesivir on average enjoyed 27-days gain of recovery with 30-days follow-up the difference in rmtrs was statistically significant with p001 demonstrating the superiority of remdesivir this is consistent with the original analysis in terms of the rate ratio of recovery 9  meanwhile in the bottom penal of table 6  more percentiles of the time to recovery were reported with p values the early difference for remdesivir vs placebo in the recovery time at the 25th percentile was -1 95 ci -3 0 p65 which was not statistically significant however the differences manifested to be statistically significant later for example the 30th to 60th percentiles of the recovery time in the remdesivir group were all significantly shorter than those in the placebo group it is reasonable for the treatment to take effect after a certain length of follow-up when designing and conducting a clinical trial for new treatment particularly for the covid-19 pandemic without knowing much about the clinical outcomes many things can go wrong if the design is not well thought through the trial is not carefully conducted following the protocol or the analysis is not properly carried out critical issues with such trials include but not limited to the end point selection the type i error rate control double blinding or open label early termination of a trial the validity of the ph assumption in a cox model assumptions for statistical tests and models etc in contrast to searching for a needle in a haystack the trial design should be more targeted focused and tailored for specific needs of covid-19 patients and particular disease characteristics and severities 27  given the emergency and fast spread of the

conduct the trial outcomes unfold so fast that any adaptation may not be able to catch up with the speed of recruitment as a summary our recommendations for covid-19 trials are listed as follows 1 adopt death as a single end point for severe hospitalized covid-19 patients or live discharge from the hospital for moderately severe covid-19 patients 2 conduct the gold standard trial scheme a randomized double-blind controlled trial with equal randomization 12 or 13 allocation ratio for control vs treatment 3 with multiple agents tested in one trial allow the trial to drop certain treatment due to futility or toxicity 4 adopt the restricted mean survival time as the metric to quantify the treatment effect when the proportional hazards assumption is not satisfied otherwise standard approaches using the hazard ratios and log-rank tests should be used 5 control the type i error rate any sample size alternation during the trial must be planned and evaluated in advance with a strict control of the false positive rate 6 intent-to-treat analysis or its modified version is recommended for the final analysis although adaptive design has gained much popularity and is playing an increasingly important role in oncology trials the advantages of adaptive design may be mitigated to large extent under such a fast patient enrollment because the impact of any adaptation may be too slow to manifest before the trial is completed as a result our recommendations follow the gold standard scheme of conventional trial design without much adaptation ingredient which may help

inhibits ev71 replication we first sought to investigate the antiviral activity of remdesivir against ev71 in a broad dilution range based on data from other viruses we chose five concentrations ranging from 001 m to 100 m we first infected hela cells with ev71 moi  1 for 1 h then the inoculum was removed and medium with remdesivir at varying concentrations was added after 24 h of treatment cellular rna was isolated and subjected to qrt-pcr analysis remdesivir showed a dose-dependent inhibition of ev71 replication figure 1a ec50  0991 m and had little effect on cell viability figure 1b although ev71 replication seemed slightly enhanced at low remdesivir concentrations 001  01 m moreover viral protein synthesis was inhibited by remdesivir treatment figure 1c during positive-sense rna virus replication dsrna is present in the cellular replication site of the virus and can be detected by dsrna-specific antibodies a noticeable reduction in dsrna staining was discovered in the remdesivir-treated groups figure 1d in addition the number of secreted virions in the culture supernatant was reduced upon remdesivir treatment figure 1e with an ec50  0203 m taken together these results suggest that remdesivir potently inhibits ev71 replication without affecting cell viability since remdesivir inhibits the replication of other viruses through targeting of viral rdrp we sought to rule out the effects of remdesivir on virus entry to this end we performed experiments using different methods as follows first cells were pretreated with remdesivir for 2 h and then ev71 was adsorbed for 1 h at 4c figure 2a intriguingly after pretreatment remdesivir slightly enhanced ev71 replication at low concentrations and inhibited virus replication at 100 m figure 2b similar results were observed for remdesivir-treated sars-cov-2 wang et al 2020 although we cannot find an explanation for the recent phenomenon the latter inhibition may be because the removal of remdesivir was not sufficient or the intracellular level of remdesivir was still enough to inhibit ev71 replication to study whether remdesivir affects ev71 binding to viral receptors on the cell surface we mixed ev71 and remdesivir and coadsorbed them to hela cells for 1 h at 4c then the mixture was discarded and the cells were washed with dpbs to remove any unabsorbed ev71 next fresh medium was added and the culture plate was transferred to a 37c incubator until 24 h hpi figure 2a as depicted in figure 2c remdesivir did not inhibit ev71 binding to cells to investigate whether remdesivir affects ev71 entry into the cell ev71 was first added to hela cells for 1 h at 4c then the unbound virions were discarded and the cells were washed with dpbs next medium containing remdesivir at different concentrations was added the plate was transferred to a 37c incubator to initiate virus entry for 1 h figure 2a and then the medium was refreshed as expected remdesivir did not affect ev71 entry into the cell at low concentrations figure 2d the reduction in ev71 rna at high remdesivir levels may be due to insufficient removal of the drug as a control the effects of remdesivir on viral replication were determined by adding fresh medium containing remdesivir after ev71 binding 4c and entry 37c and culturing cells until 24 hpi figure 2a as expected under this condition remdesivir severely inhibited ev71 replication and even abolished ev71 transcription at high concentrations figure 2e combined these data illustrate that remdesivir effectively inhibits the proliferation of ev71 post virus entry to investigate the possible mechanism by which remdesivir inhibits ev71 infection we first sought to detect the level of ev71 crna upon remdesivir treatment to this end we designed a specific primer containing a unique tag for reverse transcription and a forward qrt-pcr primer was designed to specifically target the tag figure 3a kawakami et al 2011 the different levels of ev71 crna were determined by qrt-pcr and after normalization of the ev71 level crna to actin expression a reduction in ev71 crna was observed after remdesivir treatment figures 3bc therefore remdesivir reduced both crna and vrna synthesis of ev71 enterovirus crna and vrna are both synthesized by 3drdrp within the palm subdomain three motifs a b and c are highly conserved in particular motif b forms a loop--helix structure to assist binding of template rna and an asn residue is involved in substrate discrimination which preferentially selects ribonucleoside triphosphates over dntps shu and gong 2016 warren et al 2016 peersen 2017 a previous study superimposed different rna virus rdrp sequences revealing that rhinoviruses flaviviruses and noroviruses share high similarity between nucleotide binding domains lo et al 2017 hence the antiviral spectrum of remdesivir may be extended to other enteroviruses based on protein amino acid sequences retrieved from uniport motif b is highly conserved among the four human enterovirus species figure 4a to further verify whether remdesivir also inhibits the replication of other enteroviruses we selected two enteroviruses stocked in the laboratory and found that remdesivir also showed potent efficacy toward cvb3 figure 4b and ev70 figure 4c with ec50  0097 m and ec50  0026 m respectively these data demonstrated that remdesivir exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy against enterovirus human enteroviruses can cause a wide range of diseases in humans from mild respiratory illness to myocarditis and from hfmd to severe aseptic meningitis the most harmful virus pv is possibly the next virus that will be eradicated after variola major the top two hfmd causative pathogens are ev71 and cav16 lee 2016 ev71 is responsible for severe neurological complications and is considered the most critical enterovirus in the post-polio era however the lack of specific antivirals makes enterovirus infection treatment largely dependent on supportive therapy thus pan-enterovirus antivirals are needed here we discovered that a phosphoramidate prodrug of nuc remdesivir which has already been shown to be effective against ebov jacobs et al 2016 warren et al 2016 tchesnokov et al 2019 cov sheahan et al 2017 agostini et al 2018 and niv lo et al 2017 lo et al 2019 exhibits prominent efficacy against ev71 further experiments revealed that the antiviral effects of remdesivir begin after virus entry and include inhibition of viral crna and vrna synthesis the possible mechanism by which remdesivir inhibits rna virus replication has been elucidated in paramyxoviridae and filovirus for rsv and niv remdesivir causes premature termination of nascent rna transcripts warren et al 2016 jordan et al 2018 a similar result was observed for ebov rdrp in addition remdesivir caused a delayed chain termination that could not be overcome by the addition of higher concentrations of nucleotides tchesnokov et al 2019 although the precise mechanism by which remdesivir inhibits enterovirus replication still needs further investigation using crna pcr we noticed that ev71 crna was nearly undetectable after exposure to high concentrations of remdesivir hence 3d may incorporate remdesivir into its nascent rna and cause subsequent inhibition of ev71 crna synthesis besides rdrp motif b within the 3d protein of different enteroviruses is highly conserved bruenn 2003 shu and gong 2016 peersen 2017 and remdesivir inhibited cvb3 and ev70 replication which represent human enteroviruses b and d respectively consequently remdesivir can be further developed as a pan-enterovirus antiviral one limitation of our study is the lack of an in vivo efficacy evaluation of remdesivir due to the lack of a suitable animal model for ev71 two conventional models are used a mouse-adapted virus strain that can cause neurological symptoms after infection wang et al 2011 chang et al 2015 and intracranial infection of newborn suckling mice lee et al 2014 however our laboratory does not possess the mouse-adapted strain and the newborn mouse model is ineffective for evaluating the efficacy of antivirals in the most prevalent suckling mouse model it is challenging to compare antiviral efficacy due to an excessive number of variations future studies can be adopted by utilizing scavenger receptor class b member 2 scarb2 a receptor of ev71 in transgenic mice to evaluate the effect of remdesivir on ev71 chang et al 2013 fujii et al 2013 regarding the other receptor p-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 psgl-1 transgenic mice are insufficient for evaluation of ev71 infection liu et al 2012 the in vivo efficacy of remdesivir against other enteroviruses might be evaluated in existing enteroviral mouse models eg cvb3 an intriguing result observed in this study was that remdesivir slightly enhanced ev71 replication at low concentrations 001  01 m moreover this effect is likely related to remdesivir pretreatment which may affect subsequent viral entry steps additionally remdesivir was found to enhance sars-cov-2 entry compared to chloroquine slightly the mechanism by which remdesivir enhances virus replication after pretreatment needs further investigation however this study suggests the possibility that combining remdesivir with other virus entry inhibitors eg neutralizing antibody or nafamostat may be efficient for the treatment of viral diseases by compensating for the virus replication enhancing effects of remdesivir also these findings should be taken into account when considering the remdesivir research during the current sars-cov-2 pandemic in summary remdesivir is a potent inhibitor of replication of ev71 and other enteroviruses in cells hence future studies may combine accurate diagnosis and effective antivirals to prevent possible neurological disorders resulting from enterovirus infection especially in ev71-induced cases the datasets generated for this study can be found in ncbi under

cannot replicate outside cells they therefore need access to the cells of a host organism before they can spread transmission of a zoonosis to humans implies the existence of a new route by which it infiltrates human cells the sars virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in the lungs as receptor docking by means of the spikes on its envelope in the reninangiotensin system ace2 serves to counter the action of ace which is well known in pharmacology as a target structure for antihypertensives ace inhibitors ace2 can metabolize both angiotensin i and angiotensin ii the resultant angiotensin- 1 7 exerts an anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory action via the mas receptor genome analysis of the new viruses has shown thatdespite a number of mutationsthere are structural analogies between the binding sites of the sars virus and sars-cov-2 for the new viruses too ace2 serves as receptor and thus as entry point to the human body 3 4 a crucial part is also played by a serine protease in the host cells this enzyme known as transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 enables fusion with the host cell and is thus an important factor in the dissemination of influenza viruses and coronaviruses in the cells of the human body potential candidates for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection are therefore peptides or small-molecular substances that block the membrane-associated enzyme ace2 or alternatively inhibitors of tmprss2 figure camostat an inhibitor of this protease is licensed in japan for treatment of chronic pancreatitis 4 but no clinical trials of camostat in coronavirus infection have yet been conducted among the clinical trials initiated to date one project is investigating the administration of recombinant ace2 enzyme to treat the infection table 1 soluble ace2 might slow the spread by competitive binding to the virus on the other hand ace2 antibodies might be a suitable means of blocking the viruss access to the patients cells 5 according to preliminary reports the antimalarial drug chloroquine prevents the terminal glycosylation of ace2 moreover chloroquineor its derivative hydroxychloroquineincreases the ph in the endosomes involved in the uptake of the virus into the cells in cell cultures the replication of sars-cov-2 was inhibited at a chloroquine concentration ec50  concentration with half-maximal effect of 113 m 6 several clinical trials are investigating the efficacy and tolerability of chloroquine in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 table 1 although vaccination strategies were developed in the context of previous epidemics such as sars and mers no vaccine for coronavirus infections is yet available potential vaccines are directed against the viral proteins the spike s protein is of particular interest as a possible antigen for vaccination because of its crucial role in viral dissemination different types of vaccines can be distinguished for instance they can contain inactivated viruses which induce neutralizing antibodies a plausible alternative is administration of rna- or dna-based vaccines with nucleic acids coding for the s protein in these cases the human organism produces the protein by which an immune response is induced subunit vaccines contain the s protein or another viral protein without carrier virus however the immunogenicity is relatively low so an adjuvant is needed vector-based vaccines comprise a protein eg the s protein that is coupled to non-replicating carrier virus particles this concept was pursued in the development of a vaccine for mers but no finished vaccine for this coronavirus infection ever became available in any case it will take some time until we have a vaccine for covid-19 it goes without saying that the safety of a vaccine is extremely important 7 8 no specific treatment for covid-19 is yet known but the search for a suitable drug is well under way on 11 march 2020 84 trials were listed on wwwclinicaltrialsgov under the keyword covid-19 the substances under investigation range from immunomodulatory approaches with immunoglobulins interferon thalidomide and glucocorticoids to treatment with virustatics such as oseltamivir darunavir and umifenovir which was developed in russia for the treatment of influenza table 1 in view of the possibility of resistance developing it would certainly be desirable to have more than one option for treatment on the basis of experience with antiviral therapeutics to date it is to be expected that evolutionary mutations of the viral genome will endow sars-cov-2 with new properties including resistance to certain substances glucocorticoid treatment was tried two decades ago in patients with sars but turned out not to be beneficial because it delayed elimination of the virus treatment with corticosteroids is also not recommended for covid-19 9 11 the nucleoside analog ribavirin was used at the beginning of the sars epidemic in 2002 this substance can be administered to treat infections with respiratory syncytial rs viruses or chronic hepatitis c in patients with sars it was usually given in combination with glucocorticoids clinically and also radiologically confirmed successful treatment was reported but none of the studies included a control group so it remains uncertain whether the medications took effect or whether recovery was spontaneous the situation is similar for the administration of some antiretrovirals such as lopinavir and nelfinavir that were developed for the treatment of hiv infection the protease inhibitor lopinavir has been usedtogether with a small booster dose of ritonavirto treat patients with covid-19 in the current pandemic five of 18 patients with worsening clinical symptoms received this medication in a singapore hospital improvement was seen in three patients but not in the other two details of the disease course were published but yielded no clear evidence for the potential efficacy of lopinavir 12 in wuhan 41 21 of 181 patients were treated with lopinavirritonavir but no decrease in virus excretion was seen 13 a detailed report of the treatment of a 35-year-old man with covid-19 in the usa was published on 5 march 2020 14 this was the first instance of treatment with the as yet unlicensed nucleoside analog remdesivir the otherwise healthy patient first a cough and fever followed by vomiting and diarrhea four days after onset of the symptoms he was admitted to the hospital the initial treatment was unspecific with antipyretics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol chest radiography then indicated pneumonia upon which the antibiotics vancomycin and cefepime were given they were discontinued a day later however because the suspicion of bacterial pneumonia was not confirmed remdesivir was infused on the evening of day 11 the patient was no longer febrile the next day and could be discharged a few days later whether the recovery was effected by remdesivir or occurred spontaneously is unknown efficacy can be determined only in randomized controlled clinical trials large clinical studies of remdesivir were initiated in february 2020 and the first results can be expected in a few weeks no specific treatment has yet been developed for coronavirus infections despite the enormous advances in antiviral drug therapy in recent years chronic diseases such as infections with hiv or hepatitis b virus can now be treated with virustatics these substances bring about long-term suppression of viral replicationand in the case of chronic hepatitis c cure drugs are also available for acute viral infections treatment with aciclovir can save the life of a patient with herpes encephalitis nucleoside analogs may shorten the course of a herpes simplex infection but the effect tends to be minor in patients with an intact immune system the course of influenza can be slightly abbreviated by neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir but only if treatment is initiated very early as a number of placebo-controlled studies have shown no additional benefit is achievedin a patient with functioning immune defenseswhen administration of the drug is delayed to even just a few days after onset of infection no account of pharmacotherapy for viral infections would be complete without a mention of the numerous setbacks that have occurred right at the beginning of the nucleoside era in the 1970s it was recognized that cytarabine could not be used as a virustatic in disseminated herpes despite its high antiviral activity dissemination of the virus persisted for longer in the treatment group than in the placebo group 15 decades later the nucleosides fialuridine and clevudine were tested for possible use against hepatitis b in both cases the treatment had to be discontinued owing to toxicity with long-term intake and research was abandoned 16 17 trials of various combinations for hiv infection were also discontinued because the treatments were insufficiently effective or poorly tolerated some pharmacological substances are known to possess high activity against coronaviruses in vitro but their efficacy and tolerability remain to be explored since most cases of covid-19 run a mild course it has to be clarified whether administration of virustatics would be advisable in such cases and whether early initiation of treatment would be essential this requires careful consideration of the benefits versus the risks in most cases of covid-19 it first becomes clear after a few days whether the infection is spreading to the lower respiratory tract ie whether pneumonia will ensue trials are therefore necessary to determine whether efficacy can be demonstrated also when treatment is commenced later the first data on inhibition of sars-cov-2 by various substances in cell culture were published online on 4 february 2020 table 2 seven different pharmaceuticals were investigated in vero-e6 cells a renal cell line from primates the concentration that evoked a half-maximal response ec50 varied between 1 m and 100 m as shown in table 2 the nucleoside analog penciclovir had a relatively weak effect ec50 96 m favipiravir licensed for the treatment of influenza in japan exhibited moderate activity as did nafamostat a striking finding was the relatively high in vitro activity of nitazoxanide a drug that was developed mainly for the treatment of protozoal infections but also acts against some bacteria and viruses the highest activity under the experimental conditions described in this publication was displayed by remdesivir with an ec50 of 077 m and an ec90 of 176 m 1 m  06 mgl 6 remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that is intracellularly metabolized to triphosphate 18 as well as ebolaviruses remdesivir inhibits coronaviruses and a range of other viruses 19 it was developed as a substance to treat ebola infection it was effective in an experiment on non-human primates but the results of a clinical trial in patients with ebola were not convincing after a preliminary analysis revealed that monoclonal antibodies offered better protection from a fatal outcome no further patients were treated with remdesivir the reasons for remdesivirs poor efficacy against ebola in this clinical trial remain unexplained 20 in the past few weeks a number of clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the efficacy of remdesivir chloroquine and other substances against covid-19 table 1 since no specific treatment for this infection has yet been established and in the light of previous experience some of these trials are planned as placebo-controlled double-blind studies they differ with regard to their inclusion criteria eg severity of disease and time from diagnosis to randomization the first trials are expected to reach completion by the end of april 2020 details of all these studies can be found at wwwclinicaltrialsgov none of the medications mentioned in this article is yet licensed for the treatment of covid-19 any administration of drugs approved for other indications constituted off-label use in an individual attempt to achieve cure that deviates from standard medical practice it is not yet known whether any of the the substances currently undergoing clinical testing will prove to be beneficial and have no adverse effects the outbreak of infection with a novel coronavirus is the latest reminder of the dangers associated with zoonoses several drugs are known to inhibit the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 in vitro since no treatment has yet proved efficacious the strengths and weaknesses of the new substances must be established in clinical trials until an effective therapy is developed the spread of sars-cov-2 must be restricted as far as possible and patients with severe covid-19 must be treated with the means at our disposal  potential drugs for the treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 in china xiaoqi pan lan dong nian yang dayi chen cheng peng   the novel coronavirus pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection chen et al 2020a 2020b 2020c sars-cov-2 that seriously endangers human health has been found throughout china and around the world including america brazil russia india peru england and other countrieszhang et al 2020abcd as of april 14 2020 a total of 83700 confirmed cases and 3351 deaths in china and more than 185 million of covid-19 confirmed cases in other countries were reported according to the speed of sars-cov-2 infection the number of confirmed and deaths of covid-19 in the world is still increasing the prevention and treatment of covid-19 is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges in the history of human development chinese government formulated quickly strict prevention and control mechanism issued the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia the seventh trial version and encouraged the front-line clinical workers to try to use the marketed medicines for covid-19 treatment national health commission national administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 fortunately as of april 14 2020 more than 78000 of patients had been successfully cured in china a number of drugs exhibit certain inhibitory effects on sars-cov-2 in china which are expected to be specific drugs for the treatment of covid-19 meanwhile a large number of clinical and fundamental studies on these potentially effective drugs are being carried out some drugs that have been clinically tested in advance have good curative effects and some drugs also have shown certain antiviral effects in vitro experiments however most of these drugs have not yet been tested in standardized clinical studies especially large sample randomized controlled trials rcts in the face of the battle between human health and viruses chinese scholars should share these potential drugs to cooperate with other countries and regions for resisting this virus attack this review lists current clinical trial drugs and potential drugs against sars-cov-2 in china including chemical drugs traditional chinese medicines tcms and biological products which is beneficial to promote researchers around the world to discover specific drugs for covid-19 treatment as soon as possible we searched the official and preprint websites pubmed and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki databases to identify literature with the following terms sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov or covid-19 or novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp from december 2019 to april 2020 those papers with a description with drugs for covid-19 treatment were selected including full-length articles comments news correspondences editorials reviews government reports case reports and especially clinical or fundamental studies we screened out chemical drugs tcms and biological medicines that played potentially therapeutic effects on covid-19 supported by scientific data the review will be updated and revised with the increasing clinical studies on these drugs for the treatment of covid-19 sars-cov-2 is a single-stranded rna virus whose genetic characteristics are obviously different from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov national health commission national administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 li et al 2020b current research showed that sars-cov-2 had more than 85 homology with bat sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 suggesting that bat is probably the natural host of sars-cov-2xu et al 2020ab zhou et al 2020 moreover many wild animals may become the potential intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 such as swinhoe bamboo rat and badgerli et al 2020c in addition to patients with sars-cov-2 infection that are the main source of infection asymptomatic patients may also spread this virus from person to person humans are mainly infected by sars-cov-2 through respiratory droplets or close contact with patients chinese academician zhong nanshan team obtained the latest clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 infected patients by analyzing 1099 cases which is the largest sample analysis to date results pointed out that only 438 showed fever symptom in the early stage and fever accounted for 879 after hospitalization fever and cough are the most common symptoms of covid-19 a few patients are accompanied by myalgia diarrhea and vomiting the latent period of covid-19 was 0-24 days the above symptoms can rapidly develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction or multiple organ failure in severe cases huang et al 2020abc covid-19 is classified into mild common severe and critically ill based on the severity of disease symptoms kaletra consists of two kinds of protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir which both can block the division of gag-pol polyproteins and generate non-infectious virus particles to specifically inhibit retroviral infectionvan der laan et al 2018 initially this drug is mainly used to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection in adults and children over 2 years of age studies in vitro experiments showed that lopinavir and ritonavir could reduce the levels of sars-cov and mers-covchu et al 2004 based on the results of substantial clinical benefits of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with sars-cov infection scientists speculated that this drug might be effective in patients with sars-cov-2 infectionhuang et al 2020abc the team in zhongshan university constructed a structural model of two new coronavirus proteases-coronavirus endopeptidase c30 and papain-like protein through homology modeling and docked lopinavirritonavir with protease models respectively results showed that lopinavir and ritonavir more easily combined with coronavirus endopeptidase c30 compared with papain-like enzymes which expressed excellent anti-sars-cov-2 effectslin et al 2020 however after using lopinavirritonavir tablets in 40 patients diagnosed with covid-19 29 cases had adverse reactions related to lopinavirritonavir such as the elevated triglycerides nausea and diarrhealiang et al 2020 therefore larger clinical trials of this drug should focus on its safety ribavirin a broad-spectrum antiviral drug can be phosphorylated in red blood cells to produce ribavirin monophosphate diphosphate and triphosphate ribavirin monophosphate is a strong inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase which can inhibit cellular guanylate synthesis reduce cellular guanylate triphosphate and block viral nucleic acid synthesis ribavirin triphosphate inhibits influenza virus rna polymerase thereby interfering with virus replicationknowles et al 2003 oral ribavirin administration with or without intravenous immunoglobulin is a well-tolerated treatment for respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection in moderately to severely immunocompromised hostsmarcelin et al 2014 in addition ribavirin was also active against dengue virus denv with the half effective concentration ec50 of 3 moll in a549 cellschang et al 2011 when ribavirin was used in combination with ifn-2b anti-mers-cov activity of ribavirin was significantly enhanced in rhesus macaquesfalzarano et al 2013 ribavirin was shown to inhibit sars-cov replication in five different cell types derived from animals or humans at therapeutically achievable concentrationmorgenstern et al 2005 however some adverse reactions should be noted during ribavirin application for example 61 of patients developed hemolytic anemia 58 hypocalcemia and 46 hypomagnesemia in 110 sars patients treated with ribavirinknowles et al 2003 given the efficacy of ribavirin in the treatment of diseases caused by sars-cov and mers-cov it is expected to become an effective drug for covid-19 treatment however the efficacy of ribavirin for the treatment of covid-19 is still controversial which are needed to further confirm in clinical trials chloroquine is an anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory drug which is widely used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis for more than 70 years anti-malarial effect of chloroquine may interfere with the replication and transcription of the plasmodium schizont dna or hinder its endocytosis thereby leading to the parasite to die due to amino acids deficiency chloroquine also has immunomodulatory activity which can synergistically enhance antiviral effectswang et al 2020abcde chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine destroy the terminal glycosylation of angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 in vitro therefore chloroquine may be potent inhibitors of sars-cov-2 infection based on the results of previous studies chloroquine phosphate has a therapeutic effect on covid-19 in vitrowang et al 2020abcde at present several clinical trials were successively announced the results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial revealed that hydroxychloroquine was significantly associated with viral load reduction or disappearance in patients with covid-19 philippe et al 2020 similarly another randomized clinical trial also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine on covid-19 which are manifested with the shortening of the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time of patients with covid-19 chen et al 2020a 2020b 2020c preliminary evidence from a multicenter prospective observational study showed that the median time to undetectable viral rna was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine and no serious adverse reactions were observed in the chloroquine group huang et al 2020abc in contrast the results of some clinical studies showed negative for the treatment of covid-19 with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for example an open-label randomized controlled trial indicated that hydroxychloroquine did not result in a higher negative conversion probability than standard-of-care alone in mild to moderate covid-19 patients and adverse events especially diarrhea were higher after receiving hydroxychloroquinetang et al 2020 another randomized double-blinded phase b clinical trial showed that the high dosage chloroquine phosphate group total 12 g presented more qtc500 ms and higher mortality rate 17 than the low dosage group total 27 g mayla et al 2020 hence the safety and efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 still need to be testified by more and bigger clinical trials 44 arbidol
 arbidol inhibits the fusion between viral envelope and cell membrane of the target cells thereby preventing the virus from entering the target cellsteissier et al 2011 arbidol is often used to resist influenza viruses in russia and china which has not yet been approved for marketing in other countries in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that arbidol has antiviral activity against influenza virus rsv rhinovirus coxsackie virus coxsackie virus b5 and adenovirusshi et al 2007 zhong et al 2009 previous studies have shown that arbidol can inhibit rna viruses and filoviridae such as sars-cov and mers-covguan et al 2018 hulseberg et al 2019 chinese scientists found that arbidol could effectively inhibit the pathological effects of sars-cov-2 at a concentration of 1030 moll with 60 times of viral load in vitro through screening a variety of antiviral drugs at present two rcts have been initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol in the treatment of covid-19 in china favipiravir is a viral rna polymerase inhibitor which can be mediated by its metabolite ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate rtp that inhibits influenza virus rna polymerase activity favipiravir was urgently used and presented good inhibitory effects on ebola virus in 2014nagata et al 2015 despite of fairly modest antiviral activity favisiravir could completely inhibit murine norovirus mnv replication at a concentration of 100 gml with little or no side effects on cells cell survival rate 80rocha-pereira et al 2012 favipiravir is proven to protect mice from lethal infection with various influenza virusesfuruta et al 2013 however previous reports showed that favipiravir might have a prolonged qt interval during treatment which should be paid attention to monitoring during medicationkumagai et al 2015 favipiravir has been officially approved by chinese medical products administration for marketing and formally put into production in china favipiravir is the first approved drug with the potential curative effect on covid-19 in china which will play an important role in prevention and control of sars-cov-2 infection remdesivir produced by gilead sciences inc is mainly used as a test drug against ebola virus one review suggested that remdesivir might be more suitable against coronavirusesjohn 2020 remdesivir has a strong anti-filovirus effect in vitro and a certain anti-coronavirus effect through inhibiting rna-dependent rna synthetase in animal experimentswang et al 2020b zumla et al 2016 subsequent research found that remdesivir was not only effective against ebola virus but also inhibits respiratory syncytial virus coronavirus nipah virus and hendra viruswarren et al 2016 researchers reported that the first covid-19 patient in the united states recovered after receiving remdesivir treatmentholshue et al 2020 in november 2019 the results of a phase ii clinical trial showed that 175 of 681 ebola patients were treated with remdesivir following 29 serious adverse reactions only one of which was related to remdesivirmulangu et al 2019 research showed that giving remdesivir could prevent rhesus macaques from getting sick before mers-cov infection and improve their symptoms after being infectedde wit et al 2020 furthermore remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection had a clear clinical benefit in sars-cov-2-infected rhesus macaques which predicted that early remdesivir treatment initiation in covid-19 patients might prevent progression to severe pneumoniabrandi et al 2020 chinese scientists have found that ec50 of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 is 077 moll in vero e6 cells and the selection index si is greater than 129 indicating that this drug can effectively inhibit sars-cov- 2 infection in vitrowang et al 2020abcde preliminary results from a clinical trial conducted by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid in usa showed that the patients who received remdesivir had 31 faster time to recovery than those who received placebo indicating that remdesivir has a significant positive effect in reducing recovery time for patients with covid-19 in addition gilead sciences inc also announced that similar clinical improvements after the 5-day and 10-day remdesivir administration in patients with severe covid-19 were found even without a placebo control however a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial conducted by chinese scientists revealed that remdesivir did not accelerate recovery or reduce the mortality in patients with severe covid-19 compared with the placebo group the rate of early discontinuation due to adverse events including nausea vomiting and cardiopulmonary failure was higher in the group receiving remdesivir than that in the placebo group 116 versus 51 although this is the first high-quality clinical trial of remdesivir in the treatment of covid-19 so far only 237 samples are included in the clinical trialwang et al 2020abcde therefore the antiviral efficacy and safety of remdesivir still need to be supported by more high-quality and larger sample clinical studies glycyrrhizic acid ga is the principal bioactive ingredient isolated from chinese herb glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma the latest glycyrrhizic acid preparations are oral ga and pure alpha ga preparation ga has a direct antiviral effect on hepatitis b virus via affecting the hepatitis b surface antigen to extracellular secretion ga can significantly inhibit hiv proliferation through immune activationsun et al 2019 a study published by stanford university and the university of hong kong proved that ga could bind to ace2 which testified that ga preparation might have potential value in preventing sars-cov-2 infection studies have shown that ga can not only exert antiviral effects by regulating immune function but also has a clear anti-inflammatory mechanismli et al 2017 a number of experts in hubei province of china said that patients with severe covid-19 could trigger an inflammatory storm leading to multiple organ failure ga derivatives also presented the antiviral activity against sars-covhoever et al 2005 a clinical retrospectively analysis of 73 sars patients showed that compound glycyrrhizin could improve the symptoms of dry cough chest tightness shortness of breath and other symptoms which is believed that compound glycyrrhizin has a certain effect on sars-covlu et al 2003 at present the commonly used oral ga  vitamin c for the treatment of covid-19 has been approved in a clinical trial in china in addition a study revealed that several active natural products and tcms might have therapeutic effects on covid-19 through screening the self-built highly pharmaceutical compound database and medicinal plant-derived compound component database the active ingredients of tcms such as deoxyrhapontin in rhei radix et rhizoma chalcone in sophorae tonkinensis radix et rhizoma polydatin in polygoni cuspidate rhizoma et radix and shikonin in arnebiae radix have good inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 although clinical studies about these active ingredients of tcms have not been conducted this discovery provides strong evidence for clinical research and treatment of covid-19 with tcms chinese herbal compound prescription refers to a prescription consisting of two or more components for the treatment of a relatively certain disease and syndrome which has a relatively prescribed processing method and usage method each herb in chinese herbal compound prescription has

covid-19 treated with xfbd are being sorted out xfbd can significantly reduce fever cough fatigue and other symptoms of the mild and common patients and prevent mild to severe in preliminary clinical studies the important targets of xfbd are mainly enriched in the pathways related to viral infection and lung injury through network pharmacology analysis suggesting that the mechanism of xfbd for the treatment of covid-19 is mainly related to combating viral infection and repairing lung injurywang et al 2020b shuanghuanglian is composed of lonicerae japonicae flos scutellariae radix and forsythiae fructus which has been used to prevent infection for more than 2000 years in china the common formulations on the market include granule oral solution and injection shuanghuanglian has multiple pharmacological activities including antibacterial antiviral and immune-enhancing functions previous studies have shown that shuanghuanglian injection has obvious antiviral effects against influenza a virus h5n1 in vivo and in vitrotang et al 2018 a systematic review of rcts suggested that shuanghuanglian could be applied for the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infectionzhang et al 2013 preliminary studies in vitro found that shuanghuanglian oral solution inhibited sars-cov-2 but whether shuanghuanglian is effective against covid-19 requires a large number of clinical trials to confirm at present shuanghuanglian has been clinically studied in shanghai public health clinical center and tongji hospital affiliated to huazhong university of science and technology shanghai institute of materia medica has negotiated and reached a cooperation agreement with relevant companies to jointly conduct in-depth research on the antiviral efficacy of shuanghuanglian chinese

grouploutfy et al 2003 at present ifn- nebulized inhalation combined with other antiviral drugs such as ribavirin has been clinically tested for the treatment of covid-19 which achieved a good therapeutic effect however it is necessary to be alert to the microbial aerosols that may be generated during ifn- nebulized inhalation due to the possibility of aerosol transmission in sars-cov-2 infectionchen et al 2020a 2020b 2020c some medical protection and disinfection should be done to reduce the risk of infection by medical staff chinese clinical trial registry announced that clinical

or improve the severity of diseaseswang and wang 2020 previous evidence showed that various vaccines were designed and synthesized to effectively prevent sars-cov and mers-cov infectionde wit et al 2016 development of vaccines need to take a long time involving virus strain isolation and selection in vitro experiments animal experiments clinical trials and administrative approval as of april 8 2020 a total of 115 covid-19 vaccine candidates in the world are under development 78 of which have been confirmed 73 of the 78 confirmed projects are currently in the exploratory or preclinical stage five fastest-growing vaccine candidates have entered clinical development stagethanh le et al 2020 inactivated vaccines recombinant protein vaccines adenovirus vector vaccines attenuated influenza virus vector live vaccines and nucleic acid vaccines against sars-cov-2 are being developed vaccines in china inactivated vaccines are the most effective path of vaccine development for newly emerging infectious diseases the latest reports indicated that chinese medical products administration has approved two clinical trials of inactivated vaccine against sars-cov-2 developed by wuhan institute of biological products co ltd combined with wuhan institute of virology and sinovac research  development co ltd respectively during recombinant protein vaccine development the construction of virus species has been completed and cell and virus species identification and genetic stability inspection animal experiments and safety evaluation testings currently are being carried out in china the adenoviral vector vaccine developed by chinese academician chen weis team was the first vaccine to be approved for clinical research currently the vaccination of the phase  clinical trial subjects of this vaccine has been completed and volunteers of the phase  clinical trial are being recruited which is the first vaccine strain against sars-cov-2 to launch the phase  clinical trial in the world moreover china has also completed the construction of attenuated influenza virus vector vaccine strains and the establishment of quality inspection methods following the quality process research and quality identification meanwhile animal experiments and safety evaluation experiments are also carried out in nucleic acid vaccine development process animal effectiveness and safety evaluation and the preparation and quality verification of clinical samples are being carried out stem cell therapy can promote endogenous injury repair by regulating the immune system and improving the microenvironment and inhibit the progression of acute inflammation in the lungs thereby relieving symptoms of respiratory distress studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells mscs can be effectively used for the treatment of mers-covzumla et al 2015 at present stem cell therapy of covid-19 is mainly focused on mscs and nk cells of which the most used is mscs on the basis of conventional treatment a 70 years old female patient with severe covid-19 was intravenously infused with allogeneic human umbilical cord mscs results showed that the main inflammatory factors il-6 and crp levels decreased the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes continuously decreased and the absolute values of t cells nk cells and b cells continued to rise results of ct imaging revealed that inflammation in the lungs gradually subsided without any adverse reactiongu et al 2020 thus mscs were shown to be safe and effective for critically ill patients with covid-19 up to now a number of medical institutions scientific research units and enterprises have launched related clinical research projects of mscs treatment of covid-19 in chinaju 2020 although stem cell therapy presents certain advantage against covid-19 more data and results are still needed to support the safety and efficacy of covid-19 treatment cp therapy is applied for treating patients with infectious diseases through extracting the cured patients plasma serum or immunoglobulin which was widely used in infectious diseases outbreaks in recent years such as pandemic influenza sars and mersarabi et al 2015 cheng et al 2005 leider et al 2010 a systematic review showed that early treatment with cp might be more effective than late treatment with thatmair-jenkins et al 2015 in theory most of the patients with covid-19 will produce specific antibodies against sars-cov-2 after the recovery which can kill and clear the virus preliminary clinical studies also confirmed that crp and il-6 levels in 3 severe covid-19 patients after plasma exchange therapy were significantly reduced lymphocytes and prothrombin time were improved but inflammatory factors in patients treated with tocilizumab did not decreaseluo et al 2020the clinical symptoms improved significantly oxygen saturation and oxygenation index tended to improve and inflammation indicators also improved within 72 hours after cp infusion for a severe covid-19 patientli et al 2020b severe illness is the leading cause of covid-19-induced death therefore cp therapy may be an effective method to reduce mortality of severe covid-19 patients with serious inflammatory response in the absence of specific treatments in china cp therapy has been added to the diagnosis and treatment plan for the novel coronavirus infected pneumonia trial edition 7 which is applicable to the treatment of cases with rapid progression severe or critically ill however cp must be collected at an appropriate time and has a higher neutralizing antibody titerbai et al 2020 at present a worldwide outbreak of covid-19 seriously affects peoples health and economic development sars-cov-2 infection has been widely caused in the general population and medical staff development of specific medicines or vaccines for the treatment of covid-19 is quite urgent chinese scientists tried various marketed drugs especially chemical drugs and tcms for the treatment of covid-19 a number of drugs with good effects against sars-cov-2 in vitro or preliminary clinical trials have emerged however there is still insufficient evidence to support the efficacy and safety of these drugs against sars-cov-2 some shortcomings exist in previous studies such as unreliable in vitro results non-standard clinical trials small sample size hence it is necessary to summarize these potential therapeutic drugs to ensure clinical medication safety and guide further standardized clinical research chemical drugs have the advantages of clear composition rapid onset of action and strong antiviral ability due to the urgency of covid-19 treatment kaletra ribavirin chloroquine remdesivir arbidol and favipiravir were clinically used to antagonize sars-cov-2 in chinanational health commission national administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 most of the above drugs show good antiviral effects during the treatment of sars-cov and mers-cov ribavirin favipiravir and remdesivir directly inhibit the viral rna polymerase leading to the premature termination of rna transcription arbidol inhibits the fusion between viral envelopeand cell membrane of the target cell preventing the virus from entering the target cell kaletra consists of two protease inhibitors that prevent the cleavage of gag-pol polyproteins resulting in the production of non-infectious virions chloroquine can interfere with the replication and transcription of pathogen dna although these chemical drugs have significant antiviral effects drug safety is an important factor to be considered in clinical application the latest clinical studies showed that lopinavir ritonavir and arbidol had no significant improvement on symptoms such as elevated body temperature or the shortening of the negative time of respiratory virus nucleic acid effect compared with the absence of any antiviral drugs in contrast the incidence of adverse reactions in the lopinavir and ritonavir groups was higher than that in the control group without antiviral drugs chloroquine and remdesivir are regarded as the promising chemical drugs against sars-cov-2 however the dosage and cycle of chloroquine need further clinical trials to confirm the clinical pharmacokinetic reports indicated that the oral half-life of chloroquine was as long as 5-60 days the median half-life is 21-30 days and the clinical lethal dose is 3-5 g therefore the clinical dosage of chloroquine needs to be adjusted according to individual differences of body weight and age the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for covid-19 treatment still lack more high-quality evidence therefore the application of these chemicals in the treatment of covid-19 should pay special attention to the latest clinical trials and drug safety studies tcm has been practiced clinically in china for thousands of years to relieve the symptoms of diseases and regulate immunity tcm is of great value in prevention and treatment of covid-19 the therapeutic effects of tcms including active ingredients of tcms chinese herbal compound prescriptions and chinese medicine injection preparations on covid-19 have been extensively studied currently active ingredients of tcms against sars-cov-2 are only studied in vitro or by computer simulation some studies have pointed out that ga can bind to ace2 by the molecular docking methods suggesting that ga preparations have potential application value for preventing sars-cov-2 infection there was a study that screened several tcms ingredients with anti-sars-cov-2 activity through virtual screening and enzymatic testing including emodin polydatin chalcone and shikonin however these active ingredients of tcms need to pass clinical trials to further confirm their efficacy against covid-19 hxzq jhqg lhqw sfjd ffts tjqw and qfpd suggested by chinese health authorities have all been tried in clinical trials all of which have shown good curative effects such as shorten the time for the patient to heal and relieve the development from mild to severexue et al 2020 hxzq can alleviate fatigue and gastrointestinal discomfort in patients with covid-19 jhqg lhqw and sfjd have similar effects which can improve the symptoms of fatigue and fever in covid-19 patients jhqg has a definite effect on the treatment of mild and common patients with covid-19 which can shorten the time of fever improve the normalization rate of lymphocytes and leukocytes and promote immunological function lhqw also shows good curative effect on mild and common patients with covid-19 which is manifested with relieving fever cough fatigue and other symptoms and effectively reducing the conversion rate of mildcommon to severe qfpd has a total effective rate of more than 90 in the early clinical treatment of covid-19 which is suitable for mild common and severe patientshe et al 2020 qfpd showed an important role in blocking the development of mild common to severe and critically ill and rescuing severe and critical illness hsbd and xfbd both are effective prescriptions summarized by chinese medical teams in the front-line clinical treatment of covid-19 based on clinical observations in wuhan which have good effects in blocking the progression of disease and improving symptoms especially in shortening the course of covid-19 in a clinical study of 50 mild covid-19 patients with tjqw oral adminstration the temperature of all patients returned to normal cough symptoms disappeared in 50 of patients symptoms of sore throat disappeared in 524 and symptoms of fatigue in 696 disappeared chinese medicine injections have also been clinically tested for severe and critically ill patients with covid-19 xiyanping reduning and tanreqing injections that all have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects can be used to treat patients with viral infection and mild bacterial infection xingnaojing injection has the effects of reducing fever resuscitating and refreshing the brain which is mainly aimed at patients with high fever following unconsciousness xuebijing injection can improve the cure rate and discharge rate of patients with covid-19 reduce the chance of conversion from severe to critically ill and promote the elimination of inflammatory factors shenmai injection can provide the immunity of patients which is mainly used to treat the immunosuppressed patients shenfu injection has the effect of resurrecting for patients with shock arachidonic acid metabolism pathway is involved in cytokine productionxiao et al 2005 the latest research showed that serum levels of inflammatory factors in patients with sars-cov-2 infection significantly increased suggesting that sars-cov-2 infection may involve cytokine stormalimuddin et al 2020 studies have screened 338 active ingredients of tcms that have potential inhibitory effects on the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway through the pharmacophore technologyren et al 2020 interestingly the above active ingredients existed in hxzq jhqg lhqw qfpd xuebijing injection reduning injection and tanreqing injection which suggested that the above tcms may resist sars-cov-2 infection by inhibiting the cytokine storm although tcms are effective and relatively safe for prevention and treatment of covid-19 clinical medication needs to be administered under the guidance of an experienced physician thereby avoiding adverse reactions due to overdose or misuse of tcms moreover clinical medication based on different symptoms and the severity of the disease is an important principle during the treatment of covid-19 with tcms for example preliminary clinical studies showed that lhqw was effective for the treatment of mild or common patients with sars-cov-2 infection which is manifested with the improvement of fever cough and diarrhea xuebijing had a wonderful effect on the treatment of severe and critically ill patients with covid-19 both tcms and chemical drugs can complement each other rather than replacing each other which has been fully demonstrated in prevention and control of this outbreak of covid-19 tcm with a relatively wide range of treatment can improve the immunity and relieve symptoms in mild cases with covid-19 such as fever cough fatigue and sore throat in terms of severe covid-19 tcm can also reduce the progression from severe to critical illness thereby reducing the mortality rate chemical drugs have clear chemical composition and significant antiviral effect which can quickly inhibit sars-cov-2 infection the latest clinical evidence showed that the integrated traditional and western medicine for the treatment of covid-19 could significantly reduce the clinical symptoms of patients shorten the course of disease and improve the clinical cure ratexia et al 2020 a retrospective analysis of 71 discharged patients with covid-19 showed that the combination therapy of ifn- arbidol high-dose of vitamin c and tcms was effective against sars-cov-2huang et al 2020abc a systematic review showed that lhqw combined with western medicines significantly improved fever symptoms with good clinical safetyqi et al 2020 zhang bolis team observed the clinical effect of integrated traditional chinese and western medicine in the treatment of covid-19 the results showed that compared with the pure western medicine group 13 cases of commonl type 4 cases of severe and 1 case of critically ill the average days of treatment in the integrated traditional chinese and western medicine treatment group 27 cases of common type 6 cases of severe and 1 case of critically ill was shortened from 715 days to 515 days the average recovery time of body temperature was shortened from 438 days to 264 days the average time of hospital stay was shortened from 959 days to 738 days the improvement rate of ct imaging was increased from 688 to 882 clinical cure rate was increased from 611 to 941 the conversion rate of common to severe and critically ill was reduced from 353 to 59xia et al 2020 biological products are currently an important means for treating severe covid-19 which can effectively relieve patients symptoms to reduce mortality development of biological products mainly includes ifn- vaccines stem cells and cp although the theoretical incidence of adverse events induced by ifn- nebulized inhalation may be lower than that of traditional administration routes the relevant medication monitoring should still be donewu et al 2020 ifn- is often used clinically in combination with other antiviral drugs to treat covid-19 such as ribavirin and favipiravir the dosage drug stability adverse reactions and the risk of secondary infection should be fully considered during ifn aerosol inhalation vaccine treatment is an effective method to prevent and treat covid-19 but the development of vaccines needs to take a long time the safety and effectiveness of drugs in vaccine development process require sufficient clinical data to verify fortunately the adenoviral vector vaccine that is independently developed by chinas team has entered the phase  clinical trials stem cell therapy also shows certain potential for covid-19 treatment the application of mscs will give new clinical plan for covid-19 treatment preliminary clinical studies have shown that cp therapy has good efficacy for severe covid-19 treatment but cp with high-quality antibody titers is difficult to obtain in the absence of specific drugs cp therapy can become a first-aid method for covid-19 patients with severe or critically ill china has accumulated a bit of experience during the prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 infection with the above drugs including chemical drugs tcms and biological products although these drugs are expected to be specific drugs for the treatment of covid-19 the adoption of these drugs without adequate evidence of efficacy and safety must be careful nowadays these potential drugs have been used to treat covid-19 by many countries and regions due to the outbreak of covid-19 the basic characteristics of these drugs including pharmacological effects indications and adverse reactions and especially advance on the treatment of covid-19 should be understood to promote reasonable medication and guide further basic research and clinical trials the authors have no conflict of interest  remdesivir in adults with severe covid-19 a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial background no specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 remdesivir gs-5734 a nucleoside analogue prodrug has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in vitro and inhibits middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 replication in animal models methods we did a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial at ten hospitals in hubei china eligible patients were adults aged 880518 years admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less oxygen saturation of 94 or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm hg or less and radiologically confirmed pneumonia patients were randomly assigned in a 21 ratio to intravenous remdesivir 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir interferons and corticosteroids the primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to

the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a rapidly spreading viral disease patients with covid-19 are at significantly increased risk for mortality and morbidity since the first report of sars-cov-2 infection it has spread to more than 210 countries around the world 2726776 active cases and 191087 death till april 24 2020 to date india has recorded 23502 active cases and 722 death till april 24 2020 there is currently no specific treatment of covid-19 current management remains supportive care ranging from symptomatic outpatient management to full intensive care support including intravenous fluids invasive and noninvasive oxygen supplementation and antibiotics
1
the objective of this paper is to briefly review the literature and update the concept of prevention and treatment of covid-19 we have highlighted here the potential therapeutic role of remdesivir chloroquinehydroxychloroquine hcq lopinavirritonavir and convalescent plasma in patients with sars-cov-2 infection
 in the absence of a proven therapy for sars-cov 2 the cornerstone of therapy for patients with covid-19 remains supportive care the standard of care management of covid-19 are as follows 
remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases it has broad-spectrum activity against rna viruses such as coronaviridae eg sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers- cov and filoviruses eg ebola it has shown prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in nonclinical models of these coronaviruses however there are currently only very limited data on the use of remdesivir in patients with covid-19 in a recent multicentric study patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection 
n
 53 who had an oxygen saturation of 94 or less with or without receiving oxygen support were enrolled besides supportive care patients received remdesivir consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily up to 10 days during a median follow-up of 18 days 68 had an improvement in oxygen-support class including 57 patients receiving mechanical ventilation however interpretation of the result of this study is limited by the lack of a randomized control group small sample size exclusion of serious cases creatinine clearance 30 mlmin and five-time elevation of serum aminotransferase variable duration of remdesivir administration noncollection of viral load data adverse effects and short-term follow-up
4
a total of 60 patients reported adverse events during follow-up the result of a study simple trial unpublished demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day course of remdesivir achieved similar clinical improvement compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course on day 14 the european medicines agency ema has published recommendations on compassionate use of remdesivir for covid-19
5
data from several ongoing randomized controlled trials will provide further evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for covid-19
 
the antimalarial and anti-inflammatory agents chloroquine and hcq appear to block viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors proteolytic processing and endosomal acidification these agents also have immunomodulatory effects through attenuation of cytokine production and inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal activity in host cells
6
7
both drugs have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 with hcq having relatively higher potency
 
early results obtained from more than 100 patients enrolled in studies conducted in the china showed the superiority of chloroquine compared with the controls in terms of reduction of exacerbation of pneumonia duration of symptoms and delay of viral clearance all in the absence of severe side effects
8
a recent open-label study of 36 patients reported improved virologic clearance with hcq 
n
 36 compared with the controls 
n
 20 addition of azithromycin to hcq in six patients resulted in superior viral clearance 100 compared with hcq monotherapy 57
9
an uncontrolled observational study in a cohort of covid-19 inpatients 
n
 80 treated with a combination of hcq and azithromycin showed a rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load 93 at day 8
2
in a randomized parallel-group trial covid-19 patients 
n
 31 were assigned to receive an additional 5-day hcq 400 mgd treatment clinical recovery time was significantly shortened in the hcq treatment group improvement in pneumonia was more in the hcq treatment group 806 compared with the controls 548 however the patients had mild disease
10
 
in a prospective study 
n
 30 patients were randomized to hcq 400 mgday for 5 days plus standard of care and standard care alone groups virologic clearance was similar in both the groups
11
a study of 11 patients with covid-19 reported persistence of sars-cov-2 in the nasopharyngeal swab in 8 of 10 patients receiving hcq in a randomized double-blinded phase-iib clinical trial clorocovid-19 study preliminary findings suggest that the higher chloroquine dosage is associated with higher rate of qtc prolongation and mortality studies of chloroquine prophylaxis in health care workers nct04303507 and hcq for postexposure prophylaxis after high-risk exposures nct04308668 are planned or enrolling
12
 
some studies show no benefit at all while others show a benefit of taking hcqchloroquine some of the aforementioned clinical studies showed hcqchloroquine as promising agents for the treatment of mild-to-severe covid-19 however these trials have been criticized for their limitations including small sample size nonuniform study design absence of control arm and enrolment of less severe cases
2
9
10
13
results from other clinical studies could not replicate these positive findings
11
12
14
therefore there is currently no strong evidence of efficacy of hcq or chloroquine in the treatment or prevention of covid-19 chinese and italian guidelines recommend early use of hcq or chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 on case-to-case basis however this is based on weak evidence the food and drug administration fda and ema has granted an emergency-use authorization for chloroquine and hcq to treat patients when a clinical trial is not available or participation is not feasible
5
15
indian council of medical research icmr recommends the use of hcq for prophylaxis of sars cov-2 infection in high-risk cases qt-prolongation and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia is major concern in patients receiving hcq with or without azithromycin especially in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease
 
lopinavirritonavir demonstrated in vitro activity against other corona viruses via inhibition of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease results of a few small case series showed clinical benefit of using with lopinavirritonavir in patients with covid-19 however an open-label randomized trial at a single hospital concluded that lopinavirritonavir recipients and those receiving standard care did not differ significantly in time to clinical improvement median 16 days duration of intensive care unit stay and duration of mechanical ventilationoxygen supplementation
16
at present there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of lopinavirritonavir for treatment of covid-19
 
convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections has been used as a treatment in previous virus outbreaks including sars and ebola virus convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins were used in patients with sars whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with intravenous corticosteroids a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis from 32 studies of sars coronavirus infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment with convalescent plasma compared with placebo odds ratio  025 95 confidence interval ci014045 i2  0 study showed consistent evidence for a reduction in mortality especially when convalescent plasma is administered early after symptom onset no serious adverse events were seen however studies were commonly of low or very low quality lacked control groups and at moderate or high risk of bias
17
luke et al identified eight studies involving 1703 patients with spanish influenza pneumonia treated with influenza-convalescent human blood products infusion which showed a pooled absolute reduction of 21 
p
 0001 in the overall crude case-fatality rate mortality rate was lower in patients who received early treatment after 4 days of complications compared with late treatment group after 4 days of complications 26 vs 50 pooled risk difference  41 ci 2954
18
 
convalescent plasma has also been tried in treatment of covid-19 a few small preliminary case series showed clinical improvement after treatment with convalescent plasma however these studies had many limitations
19
20
limited evidence shows that convalescent plasma can be used as a treatment of covid-19 without the occurrence of severe adverse events
19
convalescent plasma that contains antibodies to sars-cov-2 might suppress viremia the patient usually develops a primary immune response by days 10 to 14 which is followed by virus clearance therefore logically it should be more effective to transfuse the convalescent plasma at the early course of disease studies showed lower mortality rate in whom convalescent plasma is administered early after symptom onset
17
18
the fda has issued guidance for use of covid-19 convalescent plasma in patients with serious covid-19 about 3 to 4 weeks after a person recovers blood can be drawn to look for the antibodies the approach involves giving covid-19 patients an infusion of antibody-rich plasma single dose of 200 ml from people who have recovered from an infection with sars-cov-2
 
the rapidly expanding knowledge regarding sars-cov-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets potential mechanisms of action of antiviral agents are 1 virus-based therapy like monoclonal antibodies or antiviral peptides targeting the various steps of viral machinery-like spike glycoprotein viral enzyme inhibitors and viral nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors and 2 host-based therapies to potentiate the interferon response affect host signalling pathways or host factors utilized by sars-cov-2 for replication
21
the world health organization who has started an international multicentric clinical trial solidarity this trial comprises of four treatment groups remdesivir chloroquinehydroxychloroquine lopinavir with ritonavir and lopinavir with ritonavir plus interferon -1a against standard of care to assess their relative effectiveness against covid-19
1
several therapies are currently being investigated globally including nitazoxanide stem cell therapy intravenous immunoglobulin interleukin-6 receptor antagonist eg tocilizumab sarilumab and siltuximab bacille calmetteguerin bcg vaccine angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists and other antivirals eg oseltamivir danoprevir darunavir ganciclovir favipiravir baloxavir marboxil umifenovir sofosbuvir ribavirin and interferon alfa
 
the most effective long-term strategy for prevention of future outbreaks of this virus would be the development of a vaccine providing protective active immunity as of april 8 2020 the global covid-19 vaccine research and development landscape included 115 vaccine candidates out of 78 confirmed active projects 73 are currently at preclinical stages
22
a few vaccine candidates have moved into clinical trial phase including mrna-1273 moderna ad5-ncov cansino biologicals ino-4800 inovio lv-smenp-dc and pathogen-specific a apc shenzhen geno-immune medical institute unfortunately a vaccine is unlikely to be ready for use before the end of 2020 or 2021 at the earliest
 who and centers for disease control and prevention guidance emphasizes the role of supportive care based on severity of illness ranging from symptomatic treatment for mild disease to evidence-based ventilator management for ards and early recognition and treatment of bacterial infections and sepsis in critically ill patients use of routine systematic corticosteroids should be avoided for the treatment of covid-19 there is currently no strong evidence of efficacy of hcqchloroquine and remdesivir or other antivirals in the treatment or prevention of covid-19 the fda and ema has granted an emergency-use authorization for chloroquinehcq to treat patients when a clinical trial is not available or participation is not feasible the icmr recommends the use of hcq for prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection in high-risk cases the ema recommends use of remdesivir for covid-19 on a compassionate basis guidelines are issued for use of convalescent plasma in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening covid-19 data from several ongoing randomized controlled trials will provide further evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of these drugs for covid-19  lianhuaqingwen exerts anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity against novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 li runfeng hou yunlong huang jicheng pan weiqi ma qinhai shi yongxia li chufang zhao jin jia zhenhua jiang haiming zheng kui huang shuxiang dai jun li xiaobo hou xiaotao wang lin zhong nanshan yang zifeng   coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses named for their coronary appearance with positive single-stranded rna genomes 2 in addition to six known strains of coronaviruses that are infectious to humans a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was detected recently in wuhan china 34 like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 also caused severe respiratory illness and even death moreover the populations susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events highlighting the necessity to prepare for future reemergence or the novel emerging viruses 5 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is initiated by zoonotic transmission likely from bats and spreads rapidly among humans 6 the basic reproduction number r0 of person-to-person spread is about at 26 which means that the sars-cov-2 infected cases grow at an exponential rate as of february 07 2020 57620 cases of the sars-cov-2 have been reported in china including 26359 suspected cases and a sustained increase is predictable the initial patient cluster with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection was reported wuhan pneumonia with unknown aetiology which bore some resemblance to sars-cov and mers-cov infections and was associated with icu admission and high mortality moreover high concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of patients requiring icu admission such as gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 7 a retrospective clinical study indicated the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases at 43  in single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients 8 and the infection fatality risk could be below 1 or even below 01  in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections 9 however it is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences with the information available so far since no specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 is currently available supportive cares including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most critical therapeutic regimens especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome 10 although the control of sars-cov-2 still presents multiple challenges in the short term more potent antiviral drugs are urgent to be developed 4 at present some drugs are effective in eliminating sars-cov-2 and improving symptoms the most promising antiviral drug for sars-cov-2 is remdesivir that is currently under clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus infection 11 however the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials in addition in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 tranditonal chinese medicines have received broad adoption especially in treating cases of mild symptoms 12 lianhuaqingwen lh a chinese patent medicine composed of 13 herbs has played a positive role in the treatment of sars-cov-2 a retrospective analysis of clinical records was conducted in the sars-cov-2 infected patients at wuhan ninth hospital and cr  wisco general hospital lh combination could significantly relieve cardinal symptoms and reduce the course of the covid-19 13 making it successively included in the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov pneumonia on trials the fourthfifthsixthseventh edition issued by national health commission of the peoples republic of china and also recommended by 20 provincial health commissions including hubei beijing and shanghai as well as national administration of traditional chinese medicine for the treatment of covid-19 moreover lh exerted broad-spectrum effects on a series of influenza viruses by inhibiting viral propagation and regulating immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with oseltamivir in reducing the course of h1n1 virus infection 11415 notably the anti-influenza activity of lh in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines such as ip-10 mcp-1 mip1a and tnf- 1 in the present study we evaluated the antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficiency of lh against a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 from guangzhou in vitro the african green monkey kidney epithelial vero e6 cells and the human hepatocellular carcinoma huh-7 cells were cultured in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem gibco usa supplemented with 10  fetal bovine serum fbs at 37 c a clinical isolated sars-cov-2 virus genebank accession no mt1232901 was propagated in vero e6 cells and viral titer was determined by 50  tissue culture infective dose tcid50 according to the cytopathic effect by use of reed-muench method 17 all the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-3 bls-3 laboratory lh capsule lot nob2001019 was obtained from yiling pharmaceutical co ltd shijiazhuang china uplc fingerprints of lh consist of 32 common peaks 9 of 32 common peaks are identified the similarities in 10 batches of lh capsules samples were all above 096 supplementary fig 1 the black powder of raw material of lh was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso to 240 mgml after shaking for 30 min at room temperature the lh solution was diluted with serum-free dmem to 24 mgml as a stock solution and stored at 20 c before using remdesivir was kindly provided by prof jiancun zhang from guangzhou institutes of biomedicine and health chinese academy of sciences and was dissolved in dmso to 100 mm and stored at 20 c before using dmem with 2 fbs was used as the dilution buffer in the follow-up experiments the cytotoxic effects of the lh on vero e6 and huh-7 cells were evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium mtt assay briefly monolayers of vero e6 cells and huh-7 cells in 96-well plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline pbs followed by incubation with indicated concentrations of lh after 72 h the cells were stained with mtt solution at 05 mgml for 4 h the supernatants were then removed and the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in 200 l dmso the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using multiskan spectrum reader thermo fisher usa the 50  cytotoxic concentration cc50 was calculated by the graphpad prism 70 software the vero e6 cell monolayers were grown in 96-well plates and inoculated with 100 tcid50 of coronavirus strains at 37 c for 2 h the inoculum was removed and the cells were subsequently incubated with indicated concentrations of lh or the positive control remdesivir following the 72 h of incubation the infected cells shown 100  cpe under the microscope the percentage of cpe in lh-treated cells were recorded the 50  inhibition concentration ic50 of the virus-induced cpe by lh was calculated by the reed-muench method 17 the vero e6 cell monolayers in 6-well plates were infected with 50 plaque-forming units pfu of sars-cov-2 for 2 h at 37 c after incubation the cell monolayers were covered with agar overlay final concentration 06  agar 2 fbs indicated concentrations of lh or remdesivir the plates were then incubated for 48 h at 37 c with 5 co2 subsequently the agar overlays were removed and the cell monolayer was fixed with 10  formalin stained with 1 crystal violet and then the plaques were counted and photographed the huh-7 cell monolayers in 12-well plate were rinsed with pbs and then exposed to coronavirus at a multiplicity of infection moi of 1 for 2 h at 37 c the inoculum was removed and replaced with the indicated concentrations of lh or mock-treated with dmem supplemented with 2 fbs for subsequent 48 h incubation at 37 c with 5 co2 the cells were then harvested for rna isolation and qpcr as described previously 16 the primer and probe sequences used for analysis are listed in supplementary table 1 the relative mrna expression was calculated using the 2ct method with gapdh as an internal reference gene monolayers of vero e6 cells in 6-well plates were incubated with sars-cov-2 at a moi of 0001 for 2 h at 37 c the virus inoculum was then removed and replaced with dmem medium supplemented with 2 fbs containing lh 600 gml or remdesivir 5 m at 48 h pi the cells were fixed dehydrated and embedded as described previously 18 ultrathin sections 70 nm of embedded cells were prepared deposited onto formvar-coated copper grids 200 mesh stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then observed under jem-1400 plus transmission electron microscopy japan electron optics laboratory co ltd jem-1400 plus statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism 70 software the differences in mrna expression levels of cytokines were compared using a one-way analysis of variance anova values of p  005 was considered to be statistically significant the cell viability after lh or remdesivir treatment was determined by mtt assay in both vero e6 and huh-7 cells lh showed unapparent cytotoxicity for both cell lines at concentrations up to 600 gml fig 1
a c the positive control remdesivir showed no cytotoxicity to cells at a concentration of 50m fig 1b d to investigate the antiviral effect of lh against sars-cov-2 virus the vero e6 cells were infected with 100 tcid50 of virus and incubated with lh at various concentrations for 72 h as shown in fig 2
a lh inhibited the replication of sars-cov-2 virus with an ic50 value of 4112 gml by cpe assay fig 2a meanwhile treatment with lh following infection also had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on plaque formation of the sars-cov-2 virus fig 2c we selected remdesivir as the positive control in our study and the results showed that remdesivir potently inhibited virus-induced cpe with an ic50 of 0651 m and a total plaque formation inhibition at 5 m fig 2b c to further confirm the efficacy of lh in inhibiting sars-cov-2 virus replication in cells we detected the viral particles in ultrathin sections of infected cells under electron microscopy at 48 h pi viral particles were found in cytoplasm intracellular vesicles endoplasmic reticulum and cell membrane and presented spherical crown-like appearance which was typical coronavirus morphology fig 3
b g lh 600 gml and positive control remdesivir 5 m treatment resulted in a reduction of the number of virions compared with mock-treated infected cells fig 3gj it was interesting to note that some virions in the surface of lh-treated cells presented spindle sharp which was in contrast to the typical spherical particles in the mock-treated cells fig 3i to determine the effect of lh on the expression of cytokines and chemokines induced by sar2-cov-2 the mrna expression levels of tnf- il-6 ccl-2mcp-1 and cxcl-10ip-10 were detected and compared between the lh-treated and mock-treated huh-7 cells the results showed that the elevated expressions of these four cytokines were significantly inhibited by lh treatment in a concentration-dependent manner fig 4
 starting from december 2019 a pandemic of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus named sars-cov-2 is sweeping the mainland of china this virus has spread to several foreign countries threatening to trigger a global outbreak several antiviral agents can be envisaged to control or prevent viral infections by antiviral assay in vitro 1417 however the efficacy and safety of novel candidates need validations in vivo even for those clinically approved medicines which means that it will take months to years for clinical practices at present symptomatic and supportive treatments remain key to clinical practices thus traditional chinese medicines tcm carried both the antiviral effect and the symptomatic relief might bring more clinical benefits 12 as a classical tcm prescription for respiratory diseases lh is the only approved medicine in the treatment of sars and influenza after the outbreak of sars-cov-2 lh as a representative tcm prescription was recommended again in the latest guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov pneumonia issued by national health commission of the peoples republic of china the purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether the therapeutic effects of lh on the covid-19 targeting virus replication and immunological regulation as it did on the infection caused by influenza viruses our previous study showed that lh exhibited in vitro anti-influenza activity with ic50 ranging from 200 to 2000 gml 1 here we demonstrated that lh also has a comparable antiviral potency against the sars-cov-2 virus with an ic50 value of 4112 gml fig 2 transmission electron microscopy tem has been a potent tool to observe virus entry virus particle assembly viral ultrastructure and budding from the plasma membrane 17 to understand the antiviral details of lh em pictures were taken from each group abundant virus particles assembled at the surface of membrane cytoplasm and plasma vesicles in the sars-cov-2 infected cells decreased in the treatment of lh at 600ugml notably slight deformation of virus particles was seen in the lh treatment which required us to make further studies highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov cause fatal pneumonia which is mainly associated with rapid virus replication massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokinechemokine responses although the pathophysiology of fatal pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses has not been completely understood accumulating evidence suggests that the cytokine storm plays a crucial role in causing fatal pneumonia 18 excessive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines were reported eg il-1 il-6 il-12 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 in the serum of sars patients 18 similar in the serum of mers patients 19 chaolin huang et al confirmed the occurrence of the cytokine storm in the covid-19 patients in icu rather than those in non-icu patients 7 based on the excessive cytokines responses suxin wan et al claimed that il-6 and il-10 levels could be used as one of the bases for predicting the outcome and prognosis of the covid-2019 20 in this study host cells infected with hcov-229e and sars-cov-2 increased the cytokine release such as tnf- il-6 ccl-2mcp-1 and cxcl-10ip-10 which was suppressed by lh in a dose-dependent manner the change of cytokine profiles suggested that lh might have a potential effect on the inhibition of cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 which also needed to be validated in vivo since the launch of lh it has been widely used as a broad spectrum of antiviral agent in the clinical practice especially for various respiratory virus infections previous studies have shown that lh a broad spectrum of effects on a series of influenza viruses by interfering with both viral and host reactions although lh significantly relieved the clinical symptoms of the covid-19 the underlying mechanism of antiviral effects on coronavirus especially in the sars-cov-2 was still elusive in this study we demonstrated that lh exerted its anti-coronavirus activity by inhibiting virus replication and reducing the cytokine release from host cells which supported the clinical application of lh in combination with existing therapies to treat covid-2019 the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  according to the world health organization who on yan gao liming yan yucen huang fengjiang liu yao zhao

luke guddat w quan wang   zhiyong lou zihe rao  affiliations  a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp also named nsp12 which catalyzes the synthesis of viral rna is a key 5 component of coronaviral replicationtranscription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug remdesivir here we report the cryo-em structure of 2019-ncov full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at a resolution of 29- additional to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus rdrp-associated nucleotidyltransferase niran domain featured in coronaviral rdrp nsp12 10 possesses a newly identified -hairpin domain at its n-terminal key residues for viral replication and transcription are observed a comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this polymerase is also provided this structure provides insight into the central component of coronaviral replicationtranscription machinery and sheds light on the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral rdrp one sentence summary structure of 2019-ncov rna polymerase infections and 4291 fatalities have been confirmed globally 2019-ncov is reported to be a new member of the betacoronavirus genus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and to several bat coronaviruses 4 compared to sars-cov and 5 mers-cov 2019-ncov appears to exhibit faster human-to-human transmission thus leading to the who declaration of a public health emergency of international concern pheic1 3 covs employ a multi-subunit replicationtranscription machinery being assembled by a set of non-structural proteins nsp produced as cleavage products of the orf1a and orf1ab viral polyproteins 5 to facilitate virus replication and transcription a key component the rna-10 dependent rna polymerase nsp12 catalyzes the synthesis of viral rna and thus plays a central role in the replication and transcription cycle of 2019-ncov possibly with the assistance of nsp7 and nsp8 as co-factors 5 6 therefore nsp12 is a primary target for the nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors eg remdesivir which shows potential to treat 2019-ncov infections 7 8 to inform drug design we have determined the structure of nsp12 in complex with its cofactors nsp7 15 and nsp8 by cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em using two different protocols one in the absence of dtt dataset-1 and the other in the presence of dtt dataset-2 the bacterially expressed full-length 2019-ncov nsp12 residues s1-q932 was incubated with nsp7 residues s1-q83 and nsp8 residues a1-q198 and the complex was then purified fig s1 cryo-em grids were prepared using this complex and preliminary screening revealed 20 excellent particle density with good dispersity after collecting and processing 7994 micrograph movies we obtained a 29- resolution 3d reconstruction of one nsp12 monomer in complex with one nsp7-nsp8 pair and one nsp8 like that observed in sars-cov nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 6 we observed classes corresponding to an nsp12 monomer in complex one nsp8 as well as individual nsp12s but these do not give atomic resolution reconstructions  fig s2  however the nsp12-25 nsp7-nsp8 complex provides all the structural information for complete and comprehensive analysis the structure of the 2019-ncov nsp12 contains a right hand polymerase domain residues s367-f920 and a nidovirus-unique n-terminal extension domain

of 2019-ncov nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex is generally similar to that of sars-cov with an rmsd value of 082 for 1078 c atoms there are key features that 40 distinguish them first the cryo-em map allows us to build the structure of 2019-ncov nsp12 covering almost all residues presenting the first insight into the complete architecture of coronaviral rdrp in sars-cov nsp12 there are seven helices with a

45 4 form a -strand in 2019-ncov nsp12 we reasoned that the contact of this region with the strand residues v96-a100 helps to stabilize it as a result these four strands form a compact semi barrel architecture therefore we identify residues y69-r249 as the complete coronaviral niran domain second the cryo-em map helps us to identify a unique n-terminal -hairpin figs 1a and 2a this -hairpin inserts in the groove clamped by the niran domain and the palm 5 subdomain in the rdrp domain and forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure  fig 2b and fig s5  another point to note is that we have observed c301-c306 and c487-c645 form disulfide bonds in the absence of dtt dataset-1 however in the presence of dtt dataset-2 chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in sars-cov  fig s3b  we reasoned the different purification buffer has led to this variation the polymerase domain adopts the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase

fig 1  the catalytic cations which are usually observed in viral polymerase structure for rna synthesis 12 13 are not observed possibly because manganese 15 was not included in the buffer for purification or in the cryo-em sampling buffer the active site chamber of 2019-ncov rdrp domain is formed by the conserved polymerase motifs a-g in the palm domain and configured like other rna polymerases figs 1a and 3a fig s6 motif a covers residues 611-tphlmgwdypkcdram-626 with a potential divalentcation-binding residue d618 which is conserved in hcv ns5b residue d220 and poliovirus pv 20

template-directed rna synthesis fig 3d  the configurations of the templateprimer entry paths the nucleoside triphosphate ntp entry channel and the nascent strand exit path are similar to those described for hcv and pv polymerase 14 figs 3 b and c the ntp entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues including k545 r553 and r555 in motif f the rna template is expected to enter the active site composed of motifs a and 35 c through a groove clamped by motif f and g motif e and the thumb subdomain support the primer strand the product-template hybrid exits the active site through the rna exit tunnel at the front side of the polymerase remdesivir the single sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl l-alaninate phosphoramidate prodrug 15  fig s7  has been reported to inhibit 2019-ncov proliferation and have potential to treat patients 40 in the clinic 7 8 the efficacy of chain-terminating nucleotide analogs requires viral rdrps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active form of the inhibitors into the growing rna strand because of the structural conservation on the polymerase catalytic chamber between 2019-ncov and hcv ns5b polymerase as well as the likely similar mechanisms of action of remdesivir and sofosbuvir 12 16 2-f-2-c-methyluridine monophosphate prodrug which targets hcv 45 5 ns5b and has been approved for the treatment of chronic hcv infection  fig s7  a model of 2019-ncov nsp12 with remdesivir diphosphate is proposed fig 4  in 2019-ncov nsp12 the 2 hydroxyl of the incoming ntp is likely to form hydrogen bonds with t680 and n691 in motif b figs 4 a and b in addition d623 in motif a is positioned to interrogate the 3 hydroxyl through hydrogen bonding moreover the hydrophobic side chain of v557 in motif f is likely to stack with 5 and stabilize the 1 template rna uridine base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir ppp-remdesivir in the structures of hcv ns5b elongation complex or its complex with pp-sofosbuvir a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir disrupts the hydrogen bonding network between s282 and d225 figs 4 c and d which is necessary to stabilize the incoming natural nucleotide 12 however key contacts formed by s282 with the incoming 10 nucleotide and the surrounding environment can result in an st resistance mutation that is already observed in the clinic 17 in the structure of apo 2019-ncov nsp12 the orientation of s682 and d623 which are strictly conserved with s282 and d225 in hcv ns5b is similar to that observed in the hcv ns5b-pp-sofosbuvir complex indicating a different recognition mechanism with that inhibitor nevertheless the close distance of s682 with the incoming ppp-remdesivir and 15 the environment surrounding the inhibitor alters the appearance of a drug-resistant mutation associated with remdesivir treatments the rapid global spread of 2019-ncov has emphasized the need for the development of new coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics the viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent target for new therapeutics especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form of compounds such 20 as remdesivir this target in addition to other promising drug targets such as the main protease whose structure was recently determined by our group 18 in complex with an inhibitor 19 20 will support the development of a cocktail of anti-coronavirus treatments that potentially can be used for the discovery of broad-spectrum antivirals 25  a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp also named nsp12 which catalyzes the synthesis of viral rna is a key 5 component of coronaviral replicationtranscription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug remdesivir here we report the cryo-em structure of 2019-ncov full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at a resolution of 29- additional to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus rdrp-associated nucleotidyltransferase niran domain featured in coronaviral rdrp nsp12 10 possesses a newly identified -hairpin domain at its n-terminal key residues for viral replication and transcription are observed a comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this polymerase is also provided this structure provides insight into the central component of coronaviral replicationtranscription machinery and sheds light on the design of

in complex with its cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 by cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em using two
different protocols one in the absence of dtt dataset-1 and the other in the presence of
dtt dataset-2 the bacterially expressed full-length covid-19 virus nsp12 residues s1-q932 was incubated

fig s1 cryo-em grids were prepared using this complex and preliminary screening revealed
excellent particle density with good dispersion after the collection and processing of 7994
micrograph movies we obtained a 29- resolution 3d reconstruction of an nsp12 monomer
in complex with one nsp7-nsp8 pair and an nsp8 monomer as was previously observed for
sars-cov 9 in addition to the
nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex we also observed single particle classes corresponding to the
nsp12-nsp8 dimer as well as individual nsp12 monomers but these do not give atomic
resolution reconstructions fig s2 however the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex reconstruction
provides the structural information for complete structural analysis the structure of the covid-19 virus nsp12 contains a right hand rdrp domain
residues s367-f920 and a nidovirus-unique n-terminal extension domain residues d60-r249
that adopts a nidovirus rdrp-associated nucleotidyltransferase niran 10 architecture the polymerase domain and niran domain
are connected by an interface domain residues a250-r365 fig

guidance of an unambiguous cryo-em map fig s3a inserts into the groove clamped by the
niran domain and the palm subdomain in the rdrp domain fig
2 the nsp7-nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the sars-cov nsp7-nsp8
pair 9 11 the orientation of the n-terminal helix of the
separate nsp8 monomer bound to nsp12 is shifted compared with that in the nsp7-nsp8 pair fig
s4a the 13 additional amino acid residues resolved at the n-terminal of nsp8 show that the
long shaft of its well-known golf club shape is bent fig
s4b the overall architecture of the covid-19 virus nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex is similar to that of
sars-cov with an rmsd value of 082 for 1078 c atoms fig s4c however there are
key features that distinguish the two the cryo-em map allowed us to build the complete
structure of covid-19 virus nsp12 including all residues except s1-d3 and g897-d901 in
contrast the first 116 residues were not resolved in sars-cov nsp12 9 the portion of the niran domain resolved in sars-cov-12
residues 4 to 28 and 51 to 249 comprises eight helices with a five-stranded -sheet
at the n terminus 9 fig 2a in the covid-19 virus structure we additionally
resolved residues a4-r118 these constitute a structural block with five anti-parallel
-strands and two helices residues n215-d218 form a -strand in covid-19 virus
nsp12 whereas these residues are less ordered in sars-cov nsp12 this region make contact with
the strand that includes residues v96-a100 thus contributing to the stabilization of its
conformation as a result these four strands form a compact semi -barrel
architecture therefore we identify residues a4-t28 and y69-r249 as the complete coronaviral
niran domain with the resolution of n-terminal residues we are also able to identify an
n-terminal -hairpin d29 to k50 figs 1a and
2a this -hairpin inserts in the groove
clamped by the niran domain and the palm subdomain in the rdrp domain and forms a set of close
contacts to stabilize the overall structure fig 2b and
fig s5 another point to note is that we have observed c301-c306 and c487-c645 form
disulfide bonds in the absence of dtt dataset-1 however in the presence of dtt
dataset-2 chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in

residues are also conserved in most viral rdrps eg 317-gdd-319 in hcv ns5b
and 327-gdd-329 pv 3dpol with the first residue being either serine or
glycine in this structure as in other rna polymerases the templateprimer entry nucleoside
triphosphate ntp entry and nascent strand exit paths are positively charged and
solvent-accessible and converge in a central cavity where the rdrp motifs mediate
template-directed rna synthesis fig 3d the
configurations of the templateprimer entry paths the nucleoside triphosphate ntp entry
channel and the nascent strand exit path are similar to those described for sars-cov and for
other rna polymerases such as hcv and pv polymerase 14 fig 3 b and c the
ntp entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues including k545 r553 and r555 in
motif f the rna template is expected to enter the active site composed of motifs a and c
through a groove clamped by motif f and g motif e and the thumb subdomain support the primer
strand the product-template hybrid exits the active site through the rna exit tunnel at the
front side of the polymerase remdesivir the single sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl l-alaninate
phosphoramidate prodrug 15 fig
s7 has been reported to inhibit covid-19 virus proliferation and therefore have clinical
potential 7 8 we will briefly discuss its possible binding and
inhibition mechanism based on the results of this study the efficacy of chain-terminating
nucleotide analogs requires viral rdrps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active
form of the inhibitors into the growing rna strand sofosbuvir
2-f-2-c-methyluridine monophosphate is a prodrug which targets hcv ns5b and
has been approved for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 16 it acts by binding to the catalytic site of hcv ns5b
polymerase 1216 given that remdesivir and sofosbuvir are both nucleotide analogs and the
structural conservation of the catalytic site between covid-19 virus nsp12 and hcv ns5b
polymerase 13 16 fig s7 we modeled remdesivir diphosphate binding
to covid-19 virus nsp12 based on superposition with sofosbuvir bound to hcv ns5b fig 4a and fig s4d overall we found that the nsp12 of
covid-19 virus has the highest similarity with the apo state of ns5b given the conformational
changes of ns5b in apoelongationinhibited states it appears catalytic residues d760 d761
and the classic d618 will undergo a conformational change to coordinate the divalent cations
fig 4b the latter will anchor the phosphate group
of the incoming nucleotide or inhibitors together with the allosteric r555 in motif f fig 4c in the structures of hcv ns5b elongation complex or
its complex with pp-sofosbuvir a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir interacts
with n291 equivalent to n691 in covid-19 virus but due to a fluorine substitution on its
sugar moiety is not capable to joint into the hydrogen bonding network with s282 and d225
fig 4d which is necessary to stabilize the incoming
natural nucleotide 13 however
remdesivir keeps an intact ribose group so it may be able to utilize this hydrogen bonds
network like a native substrate in addition t680 in covid-19 virus nsp12 is also likely to
form hydrogen bonds with the 2 hydroxyl of remdesivir and of course with incoming
natural ntp fig 4d moreover the hydrophobic side
chain of v557 in motif f is likely to stack with and stabilize the 1 template rna uridine
base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir ppp-remdesivir fig 4e the rapid global spread of covid-19 virus has emphasized the need for the development of new
coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics the viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent target
for new therapeutics especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form of
compounds such as remdesivir considering the structural similarity of nucleoside analogs the
binding mode and inhibition mechanism discussed here may also be applicable to other such kind
drugs or drug candidates include favipiravir which proves effective in clinical trials 17 this target in addition to other
promising drug targets such as the main protease could support the development of a cocktail
of anti-coronavirus treatments that potentially can be used for the discovery of
broad-spectrum antivirals  candidate drugs against sars-cov-2 and covid-19 dwight mckee l ariane sternberg ulrike stange stefan laufer cord naujokat   the outbreak of coronavirus sars-cov-2 in wuhan china in december 2019 the cause of corona virus disease of 2019 covid-19 represents a pandemic threat to global health 12 the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11th 2020 the outbreak has spread to more than 185 countries with more than 2500000 confirmed cases more than 170000 confirmed deaths and more than 650000 total recoveries worldwide as of april 20th 2020 3 hundreds of millions of lives have been affected as a result of mandatory isolationsquarantines this pandemic has the potential to overwhelm national healthcare systems and have major consequences on global economy if sars-cov-2 spread and virulence is not contained or effective treatments are not developedcoronaviruses are grouped into alpha beta gamma and delta classes coronaviruses can infect both humans and animals the source of the beta coronavirus sars-cov-2 is believed to be bats which carry the virus with no signs of disease 4 beta coronaviruses caused earlier outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndromes sars including sars-cov 20022003 in guangdong china and middle east respiratory syndrome virus mers-cov 2012 in saudi arabia 5 beta coronaviruses are pathogenic for humans and have a single stranded rna genome encapsulated by a membrane envelope 6 the coronavirus crown-like corona morphology is created by transmembrane spike glycoproteins s proteins that form homotrimers protruding from the viral surface 7 the s proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 display structural homology and conserved ectodomains so earlier strategies employed to prevent binding of sars-cov to its host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 may be relevant since sars-cov-2 also employs ace2 for cell entry 89 ace2 an exopeptidase expressed on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract may constitute a pharmacological target to limit cell entry of sars-cov-2 the established antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to inhibit terminal phosphorylation of ace2 and to elevate the ph in endosomes respectively chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine constitute candidate drugs against sars-cov infection and covid-19 disease and are now investigated for their therapeutic efficacy in international clinical trials with covid-19 patients i e solidarity trial the glycosylated s protein of sars-cov is highly immunogenic to the host immune system and murine polyclonal antibodies against sars-co-v s protein potently inhibit sars-cov-2 s-mediated cell entry indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved s epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination 9 similar to the earlier sars and mers beta coronaviruses sars-cov-2 primarily infects alveolar epithelial cell of the lung leading to a severe bilateral peripheral pneumonia with ground glass opacity in ct images covid-19 disease with a mortality rate of 2  to 5  10 sars-cov-2 also can contribute to multiple organ failure affecting heart liver kidney central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract 11 epidemiology thus far suggests that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov or mers-cov 12 multiple mechanisms now identified in the infective and replication processes of sars-cov-2 offer targets for pharmacological interventions infection of pneumocytes macrophages and pulmonary mast cells requires viral s protein this invasion process which involves attachment of s protein to the ace2 receptor is facilitated by host cell derived serine protease tmprss211 8 agents that inhibit tmprss211 such as camostat mesilate may be useful in blocking viral host cell entry after host cell entry the viral single-stranded positive rna is released for replication of virus rna and translation of virus polyproteins that are finally cleaved into mature effector proteins by virus proteases 13 the s protein interaction with ace2 on host cell cytoplasmic membrane initiates viral infection strategies capable of disrupting s protein interaction with ace2 could be of significant therapeutic value because the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 s protein to ace2 is 10-20-fold higher than for the s protein of sars-cov which may contribute to the higher contagiousness of sars-cov-2 as compared to sars-cov 12 although sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have only 79 genomic sequence similarity they share a highly conserved receptor binding domain for their s proteins 1 there is also potential for targeting other highly conserved proteins associated with sars-cov and sars-co-v-2 including rdrp and 3clpro also termed mpro which share over 95 similarity between the two viruses despite only 79 genomic sequence sharing rdrp is an rna-dependent rna polymerase required for replicating the viral genome within the host cell 3clpro and plpro are both viral proteases which break down viral polyprotein into functional units within host cells that are finally assembled into new viruses the 3clpro sequences between the two viruses are 96 similar the plpro sequence identity is 83 and their active sites show a high degree of conservation 14 drugs that have recently been shown to target mers-cov in mice 15 and to inhibit ebola virus rdrp and sars-cov-2 proteases in humans such as remdesivir and ritonavirlopinavir also constitute candidate drugs against sars-cov-2 and are now investigated for their therapeutic efficacy in covid-19 patients in 2 international clinical trials solidarity trial and discovery trial finally certain phytochemicals and natural products with high antiviral activity should be considered for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 disease camostat foy-305 nn-dimethylcarbamoylmethyl 4-4-guanidinobenzoyloxy-phenylacetate methanesulfate and camostat mesilate foipantm alternatively termed camostat mesylate ni-03 cas number 59721-28-7 constitute synthetic serine protease inhibitors that were developed decades ago for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma 2324 dystrophic epidermolysis 25 exocrine pancreatic enzyme inhibition 2627 and chronic pancreatitis 28 29 30 31 camostat mesilate ni-03 is manufactured as an oral drug by nichi-iko pharmaceutical co ltd and ono pharmaceutical japan with a three times daily dose recommendation of 100 mg to 300 mg 3031 in a clinical trial investigating camostat mesilate against dyspepsia associated with non-alcoholic mild pancreatic disease 95 patients received 200 mg camostat mesilate three times daily for 2 weeks and showed only mild but no severe adverse effects 28 indicating that camostat mesilate is a well-tolerated drug nafamostat mesilate buipeltm 6-amidino-2-naphthyl-4-guanidino benzoate-dimethanesulfonate fut-175 cas number 81525-10-2 is a clinical proven and synthetic serine protease inhibitor approved in japan for the treatment of acute pancreatitis disseminated intravascular coagulation and for anticoagulation in extracorporeal circulation 32 33 34 in a screening approach of about 1100 drugs approved by the fda nafamostat mesilate has been identified to inhibit mers-cov s protein-mediated viral membrane fusion with tmprss2-expressing lung calu-3 host cells by inhibiting tmprss2 protease activity 35 since the s proteins of mers-cov and sars-cov-2 share considerable amino acid sequence homology 19 nafamostat mesilate may also inhibit cell entry of sars-cov-2 in cell culture experiments with simian vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 nafamostat mesilate was shown to be inhibitive against sars-cov-2 infection at ec50 of 2250 m 36 suggesting that nafamostat mesilate is able to prevent sars-cov-2 infection in a multicenter randomized open-label phase 2 trial in 19 patients with severe acute pancreatitis nafamostat mesilate was administered intravenously at a daily dose of 240 mg for 5 days without severe adverse effects 34 chloroquine phosphate resochintm and its derivative hydroxychloroquine quensyltm plaqueniltm hydroquintm dolquinetm quinorictm have been used for decades for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria and for the treatment of chronic q fever and various autoimmune diseases 41 and have recently been demonstrated as potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs 4243 chloroquine phosphate inhibits terminal phosphorylation of ace2 and hydroxychloroquine elevates the ph in endosomes which are involved in virus cell entry 4445 both mechanisms constitute relevant antiviral mechanisms of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in vivo hydroxychloroquine is metabolized into chloroquine chloroquine phosphate has previously been shown to inhibit sars-cov infection and spread in vitro 4446 and results from very recent studies reveal that chloroquine phosphate and more effectively hydroxychloroquine also inhibit replication of sars-cov-2 in simian vero cells 4647 by using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine in human lung fluid it was demonstrated that the concentrations of hydroxychloroquine recommended for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection comprise an oral loading dose of 400 mg twice daily at day 1 followed by an oral maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days 47 these results were deduced from in vitro data obtained from sars-cov-2-infected vero cells treated with hydroxychloroquine 47 a recent pilot trial conducted in more than 10 hospitals in wuhan jingzhou guangzhou bejing shanghai chongqing and ningbo china with more than 100 patients with covid-19 disease demonstrated that treatment with chloroquine phosphate is superior to control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting laboratory virus-negative conversion and shortening the course of covid-19 disease 48 chloroquine phosphate should be administered as an oral daily dose of 250 mg until clinical convalescence 49 thus in view of these results and the urgent clinical demand regarding sars-cov-2covid-19 pandemia chloroquine phosphate should be recommended to treat covid-19 associated pneumonia in larger populations 48 a recent open-label non-randomized clinical trial conducted in march 2020 in france with 20 covid-19 patients treated with daily 600 mg hydroxychloroquine for 6 days demonstrated at day 6 a negative viral load negative nasopharyngeal pcr in 57 of the hydroxychloroquine-treated patients as compared to negative viral load in 125 of untreated covid-19 patients control group n  16 50 in a randomized clinical trial conducted in february 2020 in wuhan china sixty two covid-19 patients were randomized to receive either daily 400 mg hydroxychloroquine for 5 days n  31 or no pharmacological treatment n  31 51 improvement and absorption of pneumonia as analyzed in chest ct at day 6 was observed in 806 of the hydroxychloroquine-treated patients vs 548 in the untreated patients 51 the results from these small studies therefore strongly suggest that hydroxychloroquine has therapeutic efficacy in covid-19 disease thus a considerable number of clinical trials investigating therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine in patients with sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 disease have been initiated in china great britain spain and thailand 52 53 54 55 56 shortly after the identification of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a metallocarboxypeptidase that mediates various cardiovascular and renal functions peptide inhibitors of the enzyme were developed by selection of constrained peptide libraries displayed on phage 61 the most potent inhibitor termed dx600 with the amino acid sequence of ac-gdyshcsplryypwwkctypdpeggg-nh2 had a ki of 28 nm and an ic50 of 101 m 61 subsequent experimental studies in mice and in human cell lines revealed that dx600 is a potent ace2 inhibitor specific for only human ace2 6263 other small-peptide and tripeptide inhibitors have been developed for potent and selective inhibition of human ace2 and inhibition of sars-cov cell entry in vitro 64 65 66 more recently synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of human ace2 including mln-4760 cas number 305335-31-3 6367 n-2-aminoethyl-1 aziridine-ethanamine 68 and the tnf- converting enzyme tace small-molecule inhibitor tapi-2 that blocks sars-cov s protein-induced shedding of ace2 6970 have been developed for experimental inhibition of sars-cov cell entry moreover the phytochemical nicotianamine cas number 34441-14-0 a metal chelator ubiquitously present in higher plants 71 was identified in high concentrations in soybean and was shown as a potent inhibitor of human ace2 with an ic50 of 84 nm 72 because dietary phytochemicals as naturally occurring compounds display a wide safety profile and less pharmacological side effects 73 nicotianamine constitutes a candidate drug for ace2 inhibition and thus blockade of sars-cov-2 cell entry finally a recent study demonstrates that a clinical-grade soluble recombinant human ace2 protein hrsace2 inhibits attachment of sars-cov-2 to simian vero-e 6 cells and inhibits infection of engineered human capillary organoids and kidney organoids by sars-cov-2 isolated from a nasopharyngeal sample of a patient with confirmed covid-19 disease 74 suggesting that hrsace2 can block host cell entry of sars-cov-2 and early stages of sars-cov-2 infections remdesivir gs-5734 cas number 1809249-37-3 is a novel small-molecule adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against ebola virus in rhesus monkeys once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg-1 remdesivir for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of ebola virus replication and protected 100 of ebola virus-infected animals against lethal disease 75 remdesivir displays antiviral activity against other single stranded rna viruses including filoviruses pneumoviruses paramyxoviruses and the coronaviruses mers-cov and sars-cov 76 77 78 remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized into its active form gs-441524 an adenine nucleotide analogue that interferes with the activity of viral rna polymerase and that promotes evasion of proofreading by viral exoribonuclease leading to inhibition of viral rna synthesis 78 remdesivir acts early in infection and decreases viral rna levels in a dose-dependent manner that parallels impairment of viral load in vitro 78 these and related mechanisms of action of remdesivir have been demonstrated in vitro for sars-cov 78 ebola virus 79 and mers-cov 80 a recent study demonstrates in cell culture experiments with simian vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 that remdesivir is inhibitive against sars-cov-2 infection at ec90 of 176 m a concentration achieved in vivo in nonhuman primate models 36 it was further shown that remdesivir efficiently inhibited sars-cov-2 infection of human liver cancer huh-7 cells which are sensitive to sars-cov-2 infection 36 the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir have been shown recently in a nonhuman primate model rhesus monkeys of mers-cov infection 81 prophylactic treatment of rhesus monkeys with remdesivir initiated 24 h prior to inoculation of mers-cov completely prevented virus-induced disease inhibited virus replication in respiratory tissues and prevented the occurrence of lung lesions 81 remdesivir treatment of rhesus monkeys 12 h after inoculation of mers-cov also provided a significant clinical benefit with reduction in clinical signs reduced virus replication in respiratory tissues and decreased occurrence and severity of lung lesions 81 from a randomized controlled trial of ebola virus therapeutics that was conducted in response to the ebola virus outbreak in the democratic republic of congo in august 2018 there are human safety data available for remdesivir in a subgroup of 175 patients treated with remdesivir loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg for 9-13 days 9 patients experienced serious adverse events 82 indicating that remdesivir is a relatively safe drug a recent clinical trial with remdesivir on a compassionate use to 53 covid-19 patients receiving oxygen support or mechanical ventilation due to an oxygen saturation of 94  or less demonstrated that intravenous treatment with 200 mg remdesivir at day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 9 days resulted in clinical improvement in 36 of the 53 patients 68 83 however the mortality rate was 18 among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5 among patients not receiving invasive ventilation 83 suggesting that remdesivir constitutes a therapeutic option for covid-19 patients not receiving invasive ventilation based on the experimental and clinical results described above clinical trials with remdesivir in covid-19 patients have been initiated recently in china 8485 the usa republic of korea and singapore 86 in the usa hong kong republic of korea singapore and taiwan 8788 in the usa 89 and in france 9091 lopinavir abt-378 is a highly potent inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease essential for intracellular hiv assembly that was developed in 1998 to circumvent hiv resistance towards the protease inhibitor ritonavir abt-538 caused by mutation of valine at position 82 val 82 in the active site of hiv protease in response to ritonavir therapy 92 because the metabolism of lopinavir is strongly inhibited by ritonavir concomitant oral administration of lopinavir and ritonavir exceeded the in vitro antiviral ec50 of lopinavir by 50-fold after 8 h in rat dog and monkey plasma 92 coadministration of 400 mg lopinavir with 50 mg ritonavir enhanced in healthy human volunteers the area under the concentration curve of lopinavir in plasma by 77-fold over that observed after dosing with lopinavir alone and mean concentrations of lopinavir exceeded the ec50 for 24 h 92 therefore the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir kaletratm has been established as an effective oral drug for the treatment of hiv-infected individuals when used in combination with other antiretroviral agents 9394an initial study in 2003 demonstrated that lopinavir at 4 gml inhibited the cytopathic effect in a plaque reduction assay with fetal rhesus kidney-4-cells infected with sars-cov hku-39849 isolate 95 in this study newly diagnosed sars patients infected with sars-cov were treated with the combination of lopinavir 400 mgritonavir 100 mg orally every 12 hours for 14 days at day 21 sars patients treated with lopinavirritonavir had a milder disease course in terms of diarrhea recurrence of fever worsening of chest radiographs and reduction of viral load compared to a historical control group 95 in a nonhuman primate model of common marmosets infected with mers-cov lopinavirritonavir-treated animals displayed an improved clinical outcome compared to untreated animals with improved weight loss lung imaging and pathological findings and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung and extrapulmonary tissues 96 in response to these findings an ongoing randomized control trial miracle trial was initiated to determine the therapeutic efficacy of lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon -1b in patients infected with mers-cov 97 in a recent randomized controlled open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients in wuhanchina with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 pneumonia oral administration of twice daily 400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir for 14 days revealed rather disappointing results compared to the control group 100 patients receiving standard-care treatment 98 treatment with lopinavirritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement and mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavirritonavir group and the standard-care group 98 moreover treatment with lopinavirritonavir treatment did not reduce viral rna loads or duration of viral rna detectability as compared with standard supportive care sars-cov-2 rna was still detected in 407 of the patients in the lopinavirritonavir group at the end of the trial at day 28 98 however the numbers of lopinavirritonavir recipients who had serious complications acute kidney injury and secondary infections or requiring noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure were fewer than in those not receiving lopinavirritonavir treatment 98 these results and observations require additional studies to determine whether treatment with lopinavirritonavir given at a certain disease stage can reduce some complications in covid-19 patients 98 finally clinical trials with lopinavirritonavir in covid-19 patients have been initiated recently in china 99 100 101 102 hong kong 103 republic of korea 104 and in europe discovery trial investigating remdesivir lopinavirritonavir and lopinavirritonavir plus interferon -1a 91 umifenovir arbidoltm ethyl-6-bromo-4-dimethylaminomethyl-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2 phenylthiomethyl-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate cas number 131707-25-0 is a small indole-derivate molecule manufactured by jsc pharmstandard russia 105 umifenovir prevents viral host cell entry by inhibition of membrane fusion of viral envelope and host cell cytoplasmic membrane via inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis thereby preventing virus infection 106 107 108 umifnovir is licensed in russia and china for oral prophylaxis and treatment of infections with influenza a and b viruses and other respiratory viruses 105 and has been demonstrated to inhibit in vitro infection with globally prevalent pathogenic viruses including hepatitis c virus hepatitis b virus ebola virus lassa virus human herpesvirus 8 poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus 109110 ultimately defining umifenovir as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in a clinical pilot trial conducted in january 2020 in wuhan china 36 patients with covid-19 disease received 400 mg umifenovir three times a day for 9 days 31 untreated covid-19 patients served as a control group 111 in this trial treatment with umifenovir showed a tendency to reduce viral load determined by rt-pcr and decreased mortality 0  vs 16  as compared to the control group 111 in a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted in february 2020 in guangdong china 16 patients with covid-19 disease received orally 200 mg umifenovir every 8 h plus lopinavir 400 mgritonavir 100 mg every 12 h for 5-21 days seventeen covid-19 patients received lopinavir 400 mgritonavir 100 mg every 12 h and served as a control group 112 after 14 days of treatment detection of sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr was negative in 94  of the umifenovir-treated patients vs 53  in the control group and the chest computed tomography scans were improving for 69  of the umifenovir-treated patients vs 29  in the control group 112 in view of these promising clinical results clinical trials with umifenovir alone or in combination with lopinavirritonavir chloroquine phosphate or carrimycin have been recently initiated in china 113 114 115 116 favipiravir avigantm t-705 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide cas number 259793-96-9 is an oral pyrazinecarboxamide derivative and guanine analogue developed by toyama chemical japan that selectively and potently inhibits the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of rna viruses and induces lethal rna transversion mutations thereby producing a nonviable virus phenotype 117 118 119 favipiravir inhibits replication of a large number of rna viruses including influenza a virus flavi- alpha- filo- bunya- arena- and noroviruses as well as west nile virus yellow fever virus foot-and-mouth-disease virus ebola virus and lassa virus 120121 in a historically controlled single-arm proof-of-concept trial conducted in response to the ebola virus outbreak in september 2014 in guinea ninety nine adults with confirmed positive semi-quantitative ebola virus rt-pcr results expressed in cycle threshold ct were treated with 6000 mg favipiravir at day 1 followed by 2400 mg favipiravir at days 2-10 122 patients were randomized by their ct 20-value and ct 20 was adjusted to a rna viral load of 77 log10 viral genome copiesml mortality at day 14 of patients in the ct  20-group n  55 was 20  whereas mortality in the ct  20-group n  44 was 91  122 suggesting that favipiravir is active in ebola patients with high viral load in response to this trial in ebola patients clinical trials with favipiravir combined with a monoclonal antibody against the human interleukin-6 receptor tocilizumab 123 or favipiravir in combination with chloroquine phosphate and the viral neuramidase inhibitor oseltamivir 124 have been initiated recently in china 3clpro also termed mpro constitutes the main protease of beta coronaviruses that is essential for processing of polyproteins translated from the viral rna 125 recently the x-ray structures of the unligated sars-cov-2 3clpro and its complex with -ketoamides designed as specific inhibitors of 3clpro were reported 126 two pyridine-containing -ketoamides designated 13a and 13b displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and were detected at sufficient concentrations in lung tissue and broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid within 4 hours to 24 hours after subcutaneous administration demonstrating lung tropism of the compounds 126 besides subcutaneous administration inhalation of nebulized 13b by mice resulted in high and long-lasting 24 hours concentrations in lung tissue without any adverse effects 126 pointing out a role of pyridine-containing -ketoamides in covid-19 therapy in a recent study that employed combined structure-assisted drug design virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening a mechanism-based inhibitor of mpro termed n3 was identified by computer-aided drug design 127 n3 a michael acceptor inhibitor that can inhibit the mpros of sars-cov and mers-cov was shown to form a covalent bond with and to be an irreversible inhibitor of sars-cov-2 mpro 127 further in a high-throughput screening approach for identifying inhibitors of sars-cov-2 mpro ebselen an organoselenium compound with anti- inflammatory anti-oxidant and cytoprotective properties was identified 127 in a plaque-reduction assay with simian vero cells infected with sars-cov-2 n3 and ebselen displayed antiviral and cell protection efficacy at ec50 values of 1677 m and 467 m respectively 127 ultimately demonstrating their antiviral potential against sars-cov-2 natural products can inhibit various steps in viral infection and replication and many of them have broad-spectrum antiviral effects the mechanisms of which have not been fully characterized they also can function as immunomodulators suppressing inflammatory reaction responsible for the major morbidity and mortality of sars-cov-2 infection phytochemicals especially flavonoids which are widely distributed in food plants and botanicals have been shown to interfere with nlrp3 inflammasome signaling 128 the respiratory distress syndrome associated with sars coronaviruses develops in part due to viral activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome within activated macrophages and t helper-1 lymphocytes which causes increased production of inflammatory cytokines 129 several flavonoids that interfere with activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome may modulate inflammatory response to sars beta coronaviruses luteolin 130 myricetin 131 apigenin 132 quercetin 133 kaempferol 134 baicalin 135 and wogonoside 136 these flavonoids have been shown to be active against a wide variety of viruses via multiple mechanisms 137138 and are available as nutraceutical supplements at a daily dose ranging from 100 mg to 500 mg emodin 6-methyl-138-trihydroxyanthraquinone cas number 518-82-1 is an anthraquinone compound found in various chinese herbs and is also produced by many species of fungi including members of the genera aspergillus pyrenochaeta and pestalotiopsis emodin has been shown to inhibit the interaction of sars-cov s protein with its receptor ace2 in a dose-dependent manner 139 resveratrol trans-354-trihydroxystilbene cas number 501-36-0 is a stilbenoid and a natural polyphenol that is found in high concentrations in the skins of red wine grapes vitis vinifera in red wine and in sprouted peanuts arachis hypogaea resveratrol has been demonstrated in vitro to inhibit mers-cov infection and to prolong cellular survival after virus infection further expression of mers-cov nucleocapsid protein essential for virus replication as well as mers-cov-induced host cell apoptosis are inhibited by resveratrol 140 suggesting that resveratrol may also be effective against sars-cov-2 infection the emergence of the novel beta coronavirus sars-cov-2 from wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 rapidly led to a pandemic involving more than 2500000 infected persons and more than 170000 deaths in 185 countries as of april 16th 2020 sars-cov-2 infection can cause a severe bilateral pneumonia that may progress to multi-organ failure and death covid-19 disease with a mortality rate of 2  to 5  10 though this may be inflated due to inadequate knowledge of the true number of cases from countries which only test individuals with strong symptoms many cases appear to be mild or even asymptomatic so the true number of cases remains unknown since no vaccine will be available for large populations until the end of 2020 it is mandatory to identify approved off-label and experimental drugs against sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 disease such drugs may constitute inhibitors of tmprss2 and ace2 established antimalarial drugs antiviral drugs inhibiting viral rna polymerase proteases and virushost cell membrane fusion as well as phytochemicals with antiviral activity as reviewed herein besides preventive strategies against sars-cov-2 infection practiced in

development and rapid provision of a vaccine the who and the european union recently and urgently initiated clinical trials to test remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir and lopinavirritonavir plus interferon -1a in covid-19 patients worldwide in the solidarity trial 141 and in the discovery trial 91 based on the experiences with infections by other viruses such as hiv and influenza virus post-exposure prophylaxis with candidate drugs against sars-cov-2 infection may be effective in preventing disease after potential exposure to the virus or positive test results and in reducing the risk of secondary virus spread and covid-19 disease candidate drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection could be clinically proven drugs such as camostat mesilate which prevents virus host cell entry by inhibiting tmprss2 8 and chloroquine phosphate which inhibits terminal phosphorylation of ace2 or hydroxychloroquine which is metabolized in vivo to chloroquine 44 for the treatment of ordinary and severe covid-19 pneumonia and to lower the mortality rate of covid-19 disease the antiviral drugs remdesivir favipiravir umifenovir and lopinavirritonavir plus interferon -1a should be administered in particular after the consideration of preliminary results from the recent ongoing clinical trials solidarity and discovery 14191 that can be expected soon moreover administration of the antiviral candidate drugs shortly after symptom onset may reduce infectiousness to other individuals by diminishing viral shedding in the respiratory secretions of sars-cov-2 infected patients that usually peaks at 5-6 days after symptom onset and lasts up to 14 days 142 albeit shorter time courses of nasopharyngeal viral shedding peak day 4 end day 7 have been reported in mild cases of covid-19 143 and prophylactic treatment of contacts could reduce their risk of becoming infected further due to their wide safety profile less pharmacological side effects and easy availability phytochemicals such as flavonoids emodin and resveratrol with postulated therapeutic efficacy against sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 disease may be used by large populations for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection and in covid-19 disease interestingly a broad-spectrum antiviral drug the ribonucleoside analog -d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 with antiviral activity against sars-cov and mers-cov in mice and against sars-cov-2 in primary human airway epithelial cells has been recently developed for the treatment of newly emerging coronavirus infections of the future 144finally in the urgent case of the accelerating covid-19 pandemic implementation of pharmacological antiviral prophylaxis and treatment of large populations has several

 zhi-wei yang yi-zhen zhao yong-jian zang he wang xun zhu ling-jie meng xiao-hui yuan lei zhang sheng-li zhang   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory infection that is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 which has spread rapidly across china and has become a global health challenge confronting the entire international community1 however the agents that are available to treat covid-19 cannot be used for prevention and they have serious side-effects such as diarrhea emesis and hyperlipidemia24 furthermore their mechanisms of action are unclear and this has hindered the individualized strategies of prevention and treatment therefore there is an urgent need to sort and develop novel agents and efforts at improving the optimistic outcome have been directed more recently at clinical therapies of covid-1957 the complete viral genome analysis has revealed that sars-cov-2 belongs to the -coronavirus genus and its gene sequence is most closely related 891 nucleotide similarity to that of coronavirus derived from rhinolophus sinicus in contrast the homology of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov mers-cov is 70408 9 in addition the open reading frame orf1a which encodes the replicase complex accounts for about 23 of the total length of sars-cov-2 genome the other 13 encodes spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins9 the sequence homologies of the five proteins between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov or mers-cov are relatively low especially the considerable genetics distance of the spike s protein9 10 during the preparation of this paper cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em and biolayer interferometry experiments evidenced that the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 spike protein and human ace2 is 20 times higher than the case of sars-cov with ace2 and antibodies that work against sars-cov may not work against sars-cov-210 thus numerous efforts have been made to explore specific therapeutic agents of covid-19 including their explicit mechanisms1012 nowadays standard structure-based virtual screening has been routinely implemented in drug discovery to quickly prioritize potential compounds for in vitro activity tests however a significant practical problem is encountered when we account for intrinsic receptor flexibility which leads to considerable computational costs in our previous works we applied an ensemble-based screening method to determine the binding profiles of ligands with flexible receptors with advantages in the discovery of novel efficacious agents and cost-effectiveness13 14 with this in mind a rapid structure-based virtual screening strategy was used to identify compounds as therapeutic agents of covid-19 by utilizing crystal structures of human ace2 accession code 1r4215 and sars-cov-2 main protease 3clpro accession code 6lu7 and homology modeling structures of viral spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins the coordinates of viral spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins were constructed by the modeler module16 with the templates of 5x586nb6 2mm4 1buc and 1ssk each homology modeling structure is partially in accordance with the respective templates with the amino acid sequence similarities of 911 707 311 and 310 respectively fig s1 in supplemental material note that the constructed spike s structure is in a manner consistent with the latest x-ray and cryo-em results with the rmsd values being 17 and 18  fig s2 virtual screening was performed using the cdocker algorithm17 and charmm force field18 which has shown to have many advantages in the development of novel antiviral drugs13 19 during the screening processes each binding site sphere was assigned with a sphere of 100  the optimal orientations of ligands within proteins were probed on the basis of interactions with binding residues and geometrical matching qualities14 2022 and then the selected docked complexes were energy-minimized using the conjugate gradient cg method and further refined by 1000-ns explicit solvent molecular dynamics md simulations using the amber16 package23 all values of binding free energies documentclass12ptminimal

enddocumentgbind which is consistent with previous simulation results of antiviral drugs13 19 in contrast to reported agents remdesivir arbidol and chloroquine the seven agents seem to induce more favorable bindings and possible inhibition of 3clpro fig 4 and fig s6 for instance the seven sorted agents generally have the h-bonding interactions with residues met49 cys145 his164 and gln189 of 3clpro fig 4 and all the docked complexes represent relatively good thermodynamic stabilities fig s6 what is more interesting is that some of them are known to be used for the antiviral applications mitoguazone mgbg which is a guanidino-containing compound with the similar structure of spermidine inhibits the key enzymes of s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase pathway or polyamine biosynthesis pathway mgbg has been widely used in the treatment of aids metformin and biguanide hydrochloride are hydrophilic and metabolically stable drugs with minimal passive membrane permeability metformin is now used as an oral hypoglycemic agent26 gallic acid has many potential therapeutic properties including anticancer and antimicrobial properties27 caffeic acid is an anti-inflammatory antioxidant and has shown significant efficacy as an inhibitor of the jak2stat3 pathway in the cancer cell lines28 sulfaguanidine is a very useful antibacterial drug that is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in addition it does not enter the bloodstream and even very young children may be given in fairly large doses29 acetylcysteine is an antioxidant with thiol group and could improve the experimental or clinical toxicity of ischemia-reperfusion syndrome in the heart kidney lung and liver moreover acetylcysteine could inhibit inflammatory stimulation and hiv replication30 on basis of the steric and hydrophobicityhydrophilicity characteristics of 3clpro the charged groups eg guanidinocarboxylate group might contribute considerably to the ligand bindings and benefit the inhibition of protease activities in summary we have performed a rapid structure-based virtual screening of the available information of protein structures and approved drug library molecular modeling docking and molecular dynamic simulations are used to reveal the inhibiting mechanisms of reported drugs eg arbidol chloroquine and remdesivir these drugs may hinder the entry and release of virions through the bindings with human ace2 and viral spike and envelope proteins in addition nhc and triazavirin present the potential of clinical application main protease 3clpro is a kind of protease related to the virus replication and should be a feasible target for rational drug design based on the mechanism of action mitoguazone metformin biguanide hydrochloride gallic acid caffeic acid sulfaguanidine and acetylcysteine should be potential inhibitors of 3clpro and their guanidinocarboxylate groups are helpful for the binding processes in terms of low toxicity and druggability they also seem to be drugs that can be used in clinical studies the authors wish to thank professor zihe rao for supplying the crystal structure of main protease  successful recovery from covid-19 pneumonia after

since late december 2019 there has been an outbreak of a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 whose spread has become an ongoing pandemic the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronaviridae family known to infect humans 1 the estimated mortality rate of covid- 19 so far is lower than that of sars or middle east respiratory syndrome covid19 2 however the ongoing covid- 19 pandemic is a significant health threat worldwide 3 the clinical symptoms of covid-19 pneumonia are the same as the common upper respiratory tract infection but the chest ct has a certain specificity 45 unfortunately there are no vaccines or medicines approved for the novel coronavirus infection 6 but more than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatments including some drug repurposing or repositioning for covid-19 7 a 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with ongoing fever chills cough fatigue and shortness of breath for more than 20 days in 2018 he had a history of follicular non-hodgkin lymphoma previously treated with chemotherapy at the time of the last hospitalization he was in hematological remission the initial physical examination revealed a bt of 394 c blood pressure of 9353 mm hg pulse of 87 bpm respiratory rate of 20 breathmin and spo2 of 96 room air the laboratory results reflected wbc 166  103 lymphopenia 035  103 aspartate aminotransferase 38 ul alanine aminotransferase 22 ul in the normal range c-reactive protein 937 mgdl range 000-049 mgdl and lactate dehydrogenase 350 ul range 0247ul blood gas analysis showed ph7510 pco2300 mmhg po21090 mmhg high-resolution computed tomography hrct scan showed an alveolar interstitial thickness defined by ground-glass opacities with bilateral perihelia and peripheral distribution in combination with thickened interlobular and intralobular lines resembling an interstitial infection fig 1
 the nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swabs was negative on two occasions a diagnosis of severe covid-19 pneumonia and moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome ards was made by bronchoscopy and by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage balf and the patient was placed in isolation he was tested negative for influenza ab virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv mycoplasma pneumoniae cryptococcus haemolyticus antigen aspergillus antigen epstein-barr virus capsid antigen igm and epstein- barr virus on the other hand the balf sample tested positive for sars-cov-2 ribonucleic acid this suggests that the lung is possibly the main target of the sars cov-19 virus 8 he was immediately admitted to the isolation ward initial management consisted of hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and large spectrum antibiotics for sars-cov19 pneumonia and possible concomitant bacterial infection in order to reduce viral infectivity viral replication and the aberrant host inflammatory response baricitinib tablets 4 mgday was started baricitinib is an inhibitor of janus kinase jak 1 and jak 2 and therefore it might help in managing the inflammation 9 however his cough dyspnea fatigue and fever did not improve when the patients respiratory symptoms worsened in the setting of persistently elevated inflammatory markers interleukin 6 il6 was 191 pgml treatment with steroids 1mgkg and the anti-interleukin il 6 receptor blocker tocilizumab with 8 mgkg body weight intravenously was started after tocilizumab administration the il-6 level decreased gradually from 196 pgml to 73 pgml with gradual improvement of the respiratory symptoms and lung function and his fever disappeared hrct after 4 days from tocilizumab infusion showed an increase of ground-glass pattern with a widespread bilateral posterior predominance involving 80 inferior lobes the alterations described are highly suggestive for interstitial pneumonia which is highly concerning for changes secondary to viral pneumonia fig 2
 the patients clinical condition worsened with dyspnea and spo2 to 91- under ambient air given the radiographic findings and laboratory results il6 was increased to 580 pgml and ferritin was 31600 ngm the idea of persistent or active 2019-ncov rna viral replication was considered clinicians pursued use of an investigational antiviral therapy a request for the use of remdesivir was submitted remdesivir arrived and a 200 mg iv loading dose was administered to the patient this was followed by orders for remdesivir 100 mg iv maintenance dose every 24 hours for the next 9 days supportive measures in addition to hydroxychloroquine and steroids were maintained during the following 24 hours the patients clinical conditions improved including dry cough and shortness of breath and his spo2 improved to 92100 under ambient air hrct fig 3
 confirmed the improvement reduction of ground-glass pattern appearance of parenchymal consolidation with inferior lobar prevalence and perilobular and peribronchovascular distribution the patient continues to be in stable condition on room air his walking test is absolute negative and he is progressing toward discharge several host factors regulate the replication of coronaviruses and they simultaneously induce dramatic changes in the host cellular structure and function t cell exhaustion is a state of t cell dysfunction that arises during many chronic infections and cancer it is defined by poor effector function sustained expression of inhibitory receptors and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory t cells 10 persistent stimulation by the virus may induce t cell exhaustion leading to loss of cytokine production and reduced function 1112 the number of total t cells and cd4 and cd8 t cells were dramatically reduced in covid-19 patients especially in patients requiring intensive care this case report describes that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high and balf analysis for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but showing residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis treatment and prognosis we speculate that the virus migrates from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract as the infection progresses which may explain the negative test results of nasopharyngeal swabs the application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to t cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery we have read with great interest the successful application of remdesivir to cure a covid-19 patient and clinical trials indicate that this drug may have significant potential as an antiviral 1314 there are some limitations to this report that must be considered our context comes from a single patient treated with remdesivir in the course of the disease this patient also received hydroxychloroquine large spectrum antibiotic janus kinase inhibitor anti-jak and tocilizumab it is possible that these medications may have impacted his clinical course he is also a 50-year-old patient with few comorbidities and his most significant risk factor for mortality is a history of follicular non-hodgkin lymphoma previously treated with chemotherapy in 2018 with additional recurrent pneumonia infection this case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat sars-cov-2 infected patients and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using balf samples our observation confirms that the radiologist plays a crucial role in the rapid identification and early diagnosis of new cases which can be of great benefit not only to the patient but also to the larger public health surveillance and response system the unconventional aspect of this case is that the analysis of the patients upper respiratory tract specimen was repeatedly sars-cov-2 negative while that of balf sample was positive for sars-cov-2 virus our report strongly suggests that tocilizumab can block the downstream signal transduction by binding mil-6r and sil-6r and it plays a role in the treatment of cytokine storm caused by covid-19 previous literature has shown significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease following remdesivir administration 16 and highlights that early initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating sars-cov-2 15  novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 steven douedi jeffrey miskoff maya saranathan   the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 also

middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov covid-19 has become the focus of the medical world and the pandemic of 202014 we present a case of elderly female presenting with fever cough and shortness of breath found to be positive for covid-19 and started on high-dose iv ascorbic acid anti-interleukin-6 hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir requiring high ventilator settings and eventually requiring vasopressors and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis cvvhd a 77-year-old middle-eastern female with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department ed from a day care facility apartment where 2 people at the facility have tested positive for covid-19 but she did not have any direct contact with these individuals about 5 days before admission the patient developed a fever with a temperature of 102f at home and went to her primary medical doctor who sent her to the ed in the ed she was found to have bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and had continued intermittent fevers with generalized weakness cough lethargy and dyspnea and was sent for testing for covid-19 then transferred to our facility for further management in our facility her temperature was 1017f blood pressure 14876 mm hg heart rate of 99 beats per minute respiratory rate of 18 per minute and oxygen saturation of 93 on room air physical exam was significant for a dry cough and bilateral rales on auscultation of the lung fields bilaterally but was unremarkable otherwise a chest x-ray fig 1 was performed showing bilateral opacities throughout the lung fields with predominance of the lower lung lobes she was admitted for possible pneumonia with isolation precautions for suspected covid-19 and was started on oxygen via nasal cannula and on 1-gram ceftazidime intravenously every 8 hours and 500 mg azithromycin orally daily ct scan of the chest fig 2 was performed showing bilateral ground glass appearance throughout the lung with predominance in the peripheral lower lobes respiratory viral panel was sent including a repeat covid-19 test table 1 all results came back negative however the patients condition deteriorated 2 days after admission to our facility and she became hypoxic to 85 oxygen saturation while on nasal cannula and remained spiking fevers up to 1034f she was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit icu for further management and was switched to ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously daily and azithromycin 500 mg via orogastric tube daily and was started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg twice daily for a 7-day course she required 100 fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 and a positive end-expiratory pressure peep of 12 to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90 12 hours later the covid-19 test from the initial facility returned positive results on day 3 of hospitalization she was started on 6 g of iv ascorbic acid twice daily and given one dose of 8 mg per kg 567 mg of tocilizumab an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody due to a shortage of vitamin c in the hospital her dose was decreased to 1 g iv daily on the 6th day of hospitalization and she was given another dose of tocilizumab on day 7 her peep increased from 12 to 16 due to worsening oxygen saturation and increased requirement despite 100 fio2 due to severe ards the decision was made to prone the patient for 18 hours a day she completed her course of antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine but remained on vitamin c and zinc approval for remdesivir was obtained from gilead sciences inc and she was given a loading dose of 200 mg on day 10 and due to worsening oxygen saturation her peep was again increased to 18 on day 11 the patient was unable to tolerate being prone due to significant desaturation to 65 on pulse oximetry and remained supine she eventually required levophed for maintenance of hemodynamic stability and her creatinine increased from her baseline of 05-06 since admission until day 10 to 265 on day 12 for this reason remdesivir was discontinued and nephrology was consulted and recommended cvvhd on day 13 on day 14 her peep requirement again increased to 20 while on 100 fio2 to maintain an oxygen saturation 90 her condition remained critical while being aggressively managed in the icu and ultimately the patients family decision was to pursue comfort measures and the patient passed away covid-19 is the cause of severe viral pneumonia rapidly leading to ards in a case series of 135 patients wan et al reported 889 of patients presented with a fever and 765 had a cough5 fatigue and myalgias 325 headache 177 and dyspnea 133 were less commonly reported5 these symptoms were also found on presentation with our patient while the covid-19 tests were pending the ct scan of the chest provided valuable information as it met the trend of findings in infected patients wan et al obtained ct scans on all patients in their study and found bilateral involvement and multiple patchy or ground glass appearance to be the primary finding5 huang et al found similar findings where 98 of ct scans obtained had bilateral involvement and multilobular consolidations6 these findings on ct scans are not unusual for a viral pneumonia influenza a h1n1 was first found to cause a pandemic in 2009 a retrospective review of 92 patients by rtk et al found 696 of patients with h1n1 had bilateral patchy pneumonic infiltrates and 413 had bilateral ground glass opacities7 while the lack of rapid testing for covid-19 has caused a delay in diagnosis perhaps the use of ct scans could provide an increased suspicion of covid-19 infection leading to earlier treatment and management our patient presented in this case received treatment with vitamin c and zinc both of which are known to improve the human immune system and aid in shortening the duration of and improving outcomes in respiratory infections including pneumonia89 in addition to vitamin and mineral supplements hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have obtained a large amount of attention for the treatment of covid-19 hydroxychloroquine a well-known anti-malarial and auto-immune medication is relatively inexpensive and has been extensively studied in the treatment for covid-19 studies have suggested hydroxychloroquine can interfere with glycosylation of the coronavirus receptors and increase endosomal ph thus inhibiting viral fusion and decreasing viral load1011 gautret et al reported a synergistic effect using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in viral elimination and decreasing viral load12 despite this evidence the use of hydroxychloroquine for viral infections has been questioned roques et al reported a study using chloroquine in chikungunya virus reporting cytokines were reduced causing the adaptive immune response to be delayed exacerbating fever and unchanged suppression of viral load13 while further studies are in need to provide concrete evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine clinical trials from china have already shown promising results for covid-19 and several countries around the world have begun using these medications tocilizumab a recombinant humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody has been extensively used in auto-immune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis14 with this monoclonal antibody interleukin-6 function is blocked and hence the differentiation of t helper cells and b cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells are inhibited14 the cytokine storm observed in patients with covid-19 has been difficult to control and manage leading to increased mortality tocilizumab therefore helps decrease the immune response and the resulting damage caused by cytokines615 while still not approved in the united states tocilizumab has thus far shown promising results in clinical trials15 other treatments for covid-19 have also emerged and have thus far shown promising results in ongoing clinical trials of these remdesivir gs-5734 and favipiravir t-705 have become the center of attention remdesivir is an adenosine analog that incorporates into viral rna causing premature termination1014 it has been found effective at inhibiting viral replication in ebola sars-cov and mers-cov infections101617 favipiravir an rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor has already obtained approval for the treatment of covid-19 in china on february 15th 202018 studies have shown favipiravir inhibited rna polymerase activity and thus prevented replication of rna viruses like covid-19 with minimal side effects18 remdesivir gs-5734 gilead sciences inc is currently under several clinical trials and all of its side effects have not yet been defined in our patient within 2 days of starting remdesivir our patient had worsening renal function eventually requiring cvvhd and vasopressors thus preventing further treatment with the medication while our patient was critically ill in the icu it is not known if this medication was the cause for further decompensation due to kidney injury further studies and clinical trials are required to fully understand the role of remdesivir and other medications in covid-19 infected patients covid-19 is a serious infection that has led to thousands of cases of severe pneumonia ards and even deaths across the globe as of now there are no approved treatments for this viral pandemic while several medications have shown to be effective in clinical trials further studies are needed to establish dosing treatment course and side effects of these medications as the number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the world the race to develop faster testing modalities to rapidly diagnose and manage these patients earlier continues to be the focus of the global

inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in vitro manli wang ruiyuan cao leike zhang xinglou yang jia liu mingyue xu zhengli shi zhihong hu wu zhong gengfu xiao   in december 2019 a novel pneumonia caused by a previously unknown pathogen emerged in wuhan a city of 11 million people in central china the initial cases were linked to exposures in a seafood market in wuhan1 as of january 27 2020 the chinese authorities reported 2835 confirmed cases in mainland china including 81 deaths additionally 19 confirmed cases were identified in hong kong macao and taiwan and 39 imported cases were identified in thailand japan south korea united states vietnam singapore nepal france australia and canada the pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which is closely related to sever acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov2 currently there is no specific treatment against the new virus therefore identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed an efficient approach to drug discovery is to test whether the existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating related viral infections the 2019-ncov belongs to betacoronavirus which also contains sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov several drugs such as ribavirin interferon lopinavir-ritonavir corticosteroids have been used in patients with sars or mers although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial3 in this study we evaluated the antiviral efficiency of five fad-approved drugs including ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir gs-5734 and favipiravir t-705 against a clinical isolate of 2019-ncov in vitro standard assays were carried out to measure the effects of these compounds on the cytotoxicity virus yield and infection rates of 2019-ncovs firstly the cytotoxicity of the candidate compounds in vero e6 cells atcc-1586 was determined by the cck8 assay then vero e6 cells were infected with ncov-2019betacovwuhanwiv0420192 at a multiplicity of infection moi of 005 in the presence of varying concentrations of the test drugs dmso was

to be 100 effective in protecting mice against ebola virus challenge although its ec50 value in vero e6 cells was as high as 67 m4 suggesting further in vivo studies are recommended to evaluate this

of rna viruses including sarsmers-cov5 infection in cultured cells mice and nonhuman primate nhp models it is currently under clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus infection6 remdesivir is an adenosine analogue which incorporates into nascent viral rna chains and results in pre-mature termination7 our time-of-addition assay showed remdesivir functioned at a stage post virus entry fig 1c d which is in agreement with its putative anti-viral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue warren et al showed that in nhp model intravenous administration of 10 mgkg dose of remdesivir resulted in concomitant persistent levels of its active form in the blood 10 m and conferred 100 protection against ebola virus infection7 our data showed that ec90 value of remdesivir against 2019-ncov in vero e6 cells was 176 m suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in nhp our preliminary data supplementary information fig s2 showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line human liver cancer huh-7 cells which is sensitive to 2019-ncov2 chloroquine a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug89 chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov10 our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and at post-entry stages of the 2019-ncov infection in vero e6 cells fig 1c d besides its antiviral activity chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body including lung after oral administration the ec90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-ncov in vero e6 cells was 690 m which can be clinically achievable as demonstrated in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg administration11 chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and therefore it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-ncov our findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-ncov infection in vitro since these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments we suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease  news feature to counter the pandemic clinicians bank on repurposed drugs jyoti madhusoodanan   there are more than 3 million confirmed covid-19 cases around the world although the virus was first reported in late 2019 the first randomized controlled trials to test drugs for effectiveness against the infection were only announced in march to date gileads remdesivir an antiviral originally developed to combat ebola is among the most widely used under the fdas compassionate use guidelines the first person in the united states to be diagnosed with covid-19 was treated with intravenous remdesivir and improved shortly after 3 on april 4 the company announced an expanded access program so hospitals can apply for the drug to treat multiple patients remdesivir mimics adenosine nucleosides which constitute one of the building blocks of genetic material its a very logical target gotte explains the most compelling argument in its favor is that most currently approved antivirals for hiv hepatitis c and even dna viruses are such nucleotide analogs suggesting that they are key to targeting viruses as the viral rna polymerase enzyme builds a new copy of its rna remdesivir competes with the nucleotide atp inserts itself into the viral genome and halts the virus from replicating its genetic material this inhibition is only effective if the enzyme frequently substitutes its natural substrate with the pharmaceutical analog but these are analogs so the logic is that all these viral enzymes always prefer the natural substrate gotte says in a recent study gotte and his colleagues tested how remdesivir might work on middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus a pathogen related to sars-cov-2 4 the team expressed the mers polymerase enzyme in insect cells and found that remdesivir was incorporated three times more often than its natural counterpart suggesting that the drug might prove to be a potent viral inhibitor once remdesivir was inserted into a growing rna chain the mers enzyme halted after adding just three more nucleotides whereas the ebola polymerase in contrast did not accept the drug as efficiently and allowed the rna chain to grow longer before it stopped viral replication this might be an early hint that the drug is more effective against mers than ebola the nuances of inhibition are different gotte explains on april 13 gottes team published results testing remdesivir with the sars-cov-2 polymerase 5 we obtained almost identical results as previously reported with the mers enzyme gotte says sars-cov sars-cov-2 and mers use remdesivir with the same high efficiency apart from preliminary clinical evidence this work is the first direct mechanistic evidence that remdesivir can act against the new pathogen right now precisely what a doctor will prescribe to someone with symptoms of covid-19 depends on several factors including the patients symptoms age or other illnesses explains neera ahuja division chief of hospital medicine at stanford university in palo alto ca those with milder symptoms quarantined at home may receive oral medications such as chloroquine whereas remdesivir which must be given intravenously is usually used in more severe cases but researchers are frantically hunting for more evidence of what will work to treat the greatest number of patients ahuja is leading one of several randomized trials to test remdesivir in covid-19 patients around the world at 65 clinics global collaborators aim to evaluate the drug in patients with varied symptoms the trial is an adaptive one so the team can alter strategies such as patient eligibility or measures of drug effectiveness as data roll in each day in preclinical studies with ebola infections in monkeys remdesivir didnt appear to have serious side effects and seemed most effective at treating disease when used within the first few days of infection animal models often set the stage to understand how these drugs will work in humans says kari nadeau professor of medicine and pediatrics at stanford university and co-investigator on the trial but its not as if this drug has ever been tested in monkeys that were experiencing severe respiratory distress or a cytokine storm nadeau adds alluding to the deadly out-of-control immune system reaction thats killed some patients several other remdesivir trials are underway including some by drug manufacturer gilead two weeks ago the companys phase iii trial criteria were expanded to include thousands more participants and to include patients who are on mechanical ventilation the company also reported preliminary results from 53 patients who received the drug via the compassionate use program 36 of the 53 showed signs of clinical improvement 6 but the data were not from a randomized clinical trial and hence lacked a control to gauge how patients would have done without the drug on april 16 media outlet stat news reported that according to a leaked video from one study site at the university of chicago several patients treated with remdesivir in the companys phase iii trials showed significant improvements the leaked video contained no information about a placebo-controlled group a statement from the university of chicago quoted by stat news said drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound an april 10 statement from gilead stated that investigations into remdesivir must not only elucidate safety and efficacy but also demonstrate in which patients it shows activity how long should they receive treatment and at what stage of their disease would treatment be most beneficial then on april 29 two further reports were published a gilead-sponsored trial in china of 237 patients found that remdesivir offered no clinically significant benefits compared to a placebo 7 but early results from the nih-sponsored trial where ahuja and nadeau are co-investigators reported that compared to a placebo remdesivir shortened the time to recovery from 15 days to 11 and also appeared to decrease mortality rates from 116 to 8 because remdesivir aims at viral enzymes its unlikely to be toxic the drug shouldnt in theory interfere with human versions of rna polymerases but many of these small molecule drugs can also be processed by the kidney or liver so we do have to watch out for side effects nadeau says concerns about side effects are greater with another group of medications those that target host proteins that the virus needs to enter cells and cause disease one such drug the antimalarial chloroquine was found to block sars-1 from entering primate cells by modifying the host cell receptors that the virus needs to bind 8 to understand how similar sars-cov-2 is to sars-1 stefan pohlmann of the university of gttingen in germany and his colleagues studied how the new virus binds to host cells and initiates infections they found that the two viruses used the same surface receptor called ace2 to enter cells and the same protein-cutting enzyme known as a protease to become infectious coronaviruses need to be activated by having their surface proteins cleaved by a host cell enzyme pohlmann says earlier it was believed that viruses used several different proteases for their activation recent studies have found that many clinically relevant viruses including mers sars influenza a and the new sars-cov-2 all rely on one particular enzyme known as tmprss2 9 if this enzyme is hit these viruses have a problem pohlmann says identifying broadly applicable targets such as tmprss2 says pohlmann is exactly whats needed to prevent pandemics like this his team found that camostat mesylate a molecule that inhibits tmprss2 could prevent sars-cov-2 from infecting cultured human lung cells the drug is currently approved to treat chronic pancreatitis in japan and might prove useful in patients who display clear symptoms but arent in critical condition pohlmann says krogan and his collaborators are also moving several of the drugs identified in their screen into clinical tests for covid-19 twenty-four of these drugs are approved for other indications such as the common diabetes drug metformin as well as others used to treat cancer parkinsons disease and hypertension as is often the case with infectious diseases the influence of the novel coronavirus on the human immune system is at times more deadly than the pathogen itself covid-19 patients particularly those with severe infections often experience a runaway immune response inflammatory molecules cause a dangerous cytokine storm some drugs currently being tested such as interferon- or an interleukin-6 inhibitor named tocilizumab are immune regulatory molecules that may work to dial down this immune response other trials are looking to recruit the help of the immune system recent trials have turned to antibodies generated by people who have successfully recovered from covid-19 infections some hospitals have begun using plasma donated by such survivors to treat patients and researchers at several hospitals have initiated trials to evaluate convalescent plasma as a treatment its not a new idea this treatment was first attempted during the 1918 flu pandemic and doctors have turned to it as a last-ditch means to counter measles pneumonia and other infections the treatment relies on antibodies that target the pathogen in question although its not a cureor a sustainable way to combat infectionsit can serve as a stopgap measure to help critically ill patients early results suggest that the method may prove effective against covid-19 10 at least two startups chinese-us firm brii biosciences and south san francisco-based centivax are isolating and developing antibody-based treatments these immune-targeting medicines may prove more effective in severe cases because by the time patients develop serious respiratory distress an antiviral alone may be insufficient says paul goepfert infectious diseases researcher at the university of alabama in birmingham but these immunosuppressants can also increase the risk of infection from other pathogensa possibility that will need further tests he adds thus far evidence to supportor undermineclinicians use of remdesivir lopinavir and other drugs has only emerged from preclinical studies or very small studies of human patients only data from randomized trials will reveal whether and how any of these medications should be recommended to covid-19 patients in the future researchers may also be able to look back to examine clinical records and identify drug combinations or patients responses to different treatment regimens one reason for the lack of data on these medications is that drugs developed for sars never reached clinical trials goepfert notes when the sars epidemic died down ideally we should have kept going with drug development he says but nobody was willing to fund it so the research died down too now gilead has also rushed to scale-up remdesivir production to match global needs the process usually requires a sequence of sensitive chemical reactions many needing novel substrates because the drug is given intravenously production has to occur in specialized sterile conditions on april 4 the company announced that they had increased available amounts and reduced production time by months eventually clinicians will likely use both drugs that block the virus from multiplying as well as medications that inhibit host proteins that viruses hijack although virus-directed therapeutics are less likely to interfere with human metabolic pathwaysand thus have fewer side effectsviruses can develop evasive mutations this is less of a problem with therapies targeting host proteins however host-directed drugs such as chloroquine must minimize toxic side effects that can arise from inhibiting cellular enzymes these issues commonly occur when drugs that target human metabolism are used to treat chronic conditions such as autoimmune diseases but these drugs may be less problematic if someone just needs a few days of treatment to help fight off an acute infection krogan explains in the short term these drugs may help individuals who are in the most desperate need he adds while we develop prophylactics and longer-term solutions such as vaccines therapeutics aimed at host enzymes offer another perk their targets appear to be used by many viruses and because theyre essential human proteins dont mutate quickly so they dont just offer a path out of the current crisisthey might be the solution to avoiding the next one as weve looked at maps of how these different viruses interact with human proteins we see similar host machinery coming up again and again krogan says its a promising sign if we had a nontoxic treatment that targeted the human protein krogan adds this could be a treatment not just for covid-19 but for something else that comes up down the line including other viruses that we dont even know yet  an update on current therapeutic drugs treating covid-19 renyi wu lujing wang hsiao-chen kuo dina ahmad shannar rebecca peter pochung chou jordan shanyi li rasika hudlikar xia liu zhigang liu george poiani j louis amorosa luigi brunetti ah-ng kong   the horrific pandemic outbreak of covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 around the world caught the health care systems in every country by storm most if not all were caught off guard without proper defense mechanisms to cope with and to control such a pandemic covid-19 caused by a new and novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has recently been identified and characterized 1 coronaviruses are named for their crown-like spikes on their surface and there are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses known as alpha beta gamma and delta 1 2 sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta sub-grouping and is one of the seventh coronavirus to date infecting humans 1 some coronaviruses such as 229e alpha coronavirus 3 oc43 beta coronavirus 4 nl63 alpha coronavirus 5 and hku1 beta coronavirus 6 were associated with mild clinical symptoms whereas sars-cov beta coronavirus 7 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov beta coronavirus 8 and sars-cov-2 caused severe diseases 2 sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus with 29891 bases 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus and shares 796 sequence identity to sars-cov 1 sars-cov-2 encodes spike s protein containing receptor binding domain rbd that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and promotes membrane fusion and uptakes of the virus into human cells such as the lung by endocytosis 1 911 upon entering the human cells sars-cov-2 like other coronaviruses will takeover or hijack the human cells protein synthesis machinery to synthesize the viral proteins and assemble the proteins and subsequent viral replication 12 once inside the human body viruses in general will trigger a series of good versus bad host responses including autophagy apoptosis stress response and innate immunity 13 fortunately majority more than 80 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms most likely due to the activation of the good response these good responders would likely activate the bodys innate immune system by activating the bodys antiviral defense mechanisms including natural killer cells and antiviral t cells and induction of interferon ifn 1316 unfortunately in about 20 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals including the immune compromised elderly patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary problems diabetics hypertension obesity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd such as emphysema pulmonary fibrosis asthma and interstitial lung disease 17 18 would encounter more severe disease characterized by significant respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and even death an important consideration to note is that ards occurs later in disease progression and is preceded by acute lung injury ali 19 this distinction may inform treatment strategy in terms of drugs directed towards cytokine storm and thrombosis which is described in this manuscript a study on sars-cov and mers-cov has found that these two coronaviruses appear to have evolved mechanisms to attenuate or delay ifn production resulting in enhanced inflammatory host responses and severe lung injury 12 13 2022 this aberrant host immune response with the production of powerful inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm found in sars-cov- and mers-cov-infected patients would correlate with disease severity and poor prognosis 13 16 2023 severe covid-19 patients exhibit profound inflammatory response 24 25 transcriptomic rna-seq analysis of covid-19 patients has revealed that several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines cxcl ccl2 cxcl2 ccl8 il33 and ccl3l1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and tnfsf10 cxcl10 il10 timp1 c5 il18 areg and nrg1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc were induced by sars-cov-2 infection suggesting a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm 26 importantly sars-cov-2 infectioninduced excessive cytokine release correlates with lung tissue injury and covid-19 pathogenesis 26 this estimated 20 of patients developing more severe disease with sars-cov-2 infection are most likely due to genetics epigenetics and or other factors with dampened innate immune response to fight the virus coupled with enhanced viral load leading to cytokine storm severe inflammatoryoxidative stress response and severe lung injury secondary to ards while there is clear understanding that the respiratory system is dramatically impacted in covid-19 patients evidence suggests that other organ systems are also affected emerging data show that sars-cov-2 may lead to damage to other organs including the heart and brain nearly 20 of hospitalized patients with covid-19 have indication of cardiac damage 17 furthermore neurologic symptoms have been reported in patients and infection of sars-cov-2 has been found in the brainstem of both humans and experimental animals 18 19 currently there is no vaccine andor specific therapeutic drugs targeting the sars-cov-2 hence it remains a major challenge to decide what potential therapeutic regimens to prevent and treat the severely sick covid-19 patients effective vaccines are essential to combat against the extremely contagious sars-cov-2 at present a lot of research efforts have been invested to develop vaccines around the world until we have specific vaccines or therapeutic drugs targeting sars-cov-2 repurposed drugs that have been approved by the fda in the usa for other indications have been used to treat covid-19 patients this review will summarize the most current pharmacotherapeutics prescribed in the treatment of severe cases of covid-19 patients these include antiviral therapy antibiotics systemic corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs including anti-arthritis drugs neuraminidase inhibitors rna synthesis inhibitors convalescent plasma and traditional herbal medicines remdesivir is a potential drug for treatment of covid-19 it is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine c-nucleoside and a broad-spectrum antiviral agent synthesized and developed by gilead sciences in 2017 as a treatment for ebola virus infection 28 remdesivir is metabolized into its active form gs-441524 that obscures viral rna polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exonuclease causing a decrease in viral rna production the antiviral mechanism of remdesivir is a delayed chain cessation of nascent viral rna animal experiments indicate that remdesivir can effectively reduce the viral load in lung tissue of mice infected with mers-cov improve lung function and alleviate pathological damage to lung tissue 29 wang et al found that remdesivir potently blocks sars-cov-2 infection at low range of micromolar concentrations and has a high selectivity index half-maximal effective concentration ec50 077 m half-cytotoxic concentration cc50  100 m si  12987 30 holshue et al reported that iv administration of remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 recovering from pneumonia in the usa 31 in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in patients with covid-19 a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multicenter phase iii clinical trial was launched on february 5 2020 in china patients in the experimental group received an initial dose of 200 mg of remdesivir and a subsequent dose of 100 mg for 9 consecutive days via intravenous infusion in addition to routine treatment patients in the control group received same dose of placebo treatment the trial is expected to conclude by the end of april 2020 the number of cases planned to be enrolled is 308 and 452 respectively 32 33 current recommendation for remdesivir includes a 10-day regimen of remdesivir treatment 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg once-daily maintenance doses for 9 days in both studies this regimen of remdesivir therapy is similar to that of former randomized clinical trial against the ebola virus 32 33 in a summary of subjects receiving remdesivir via compassionate use in the usa nearly 70 of patients had improvement in terms of oxygen requirements and many patients that were mechanically ventilated were extubated this report did not include a control group therefore extrapolating these results is difficult it is too early to conclude the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir on the enhanced clearing of viral loads in the respiratory tract but it indeed suggests a promising therapeutic effect of remdesivir 34 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs with a long history of clinical use with similar chemical structures often used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and malaria 35 compared with chloroquine hydroxychloroquine has a hydroxyl group which makes it less toxic while maintaining similar activity one mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is targeting lysosome which may be useful to control graft-versus-host disease in humans 36 with the accumulation of chloroquine in lysosomes the ph of lysosomes is significantly changed and the activity of proteases in lysosomes is directly affected thus affecting the degradation of proteins and glycosaminoglycan 36 37 chloroquine can inhibit the entry of sars-cov-2 and prevent virus-cell fusion by interfering with glycosylation of ace2 receptor and its binding with spike protein suggesting that chloroquine treatment might be more effective in the early stage of infection before covid-19 reduces ace2 expression and activity 30 38 39 hydroxychloroquine possesses anti-inflammatory effect on th17-related cytokines il-6 il-17 and il-22 in healthy individuals and systemic lupus erythematosus sle and rheumatoid arthritis ra patients 40 there is some evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce cytokine storm according to one analysis the main cause of death of covid-19 patients is related to the triggering of the cytokine storm which contributed to acute respiratory distress 41 it has been reported that hydroxychloroquine is effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 1 39 42 zinc inhibits sars-cov and retrovirus rna polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture 43 there is also evidence that zinc enhances chloroquine intracellular uptake 44 as such combining zinc with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is intriguing and is currently under investigation overall more clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic and treatment for covid-19 the us fda has issued emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 a recent study by tang et al reported that hydroxychloroquine did not lead to higher negative conversion rates but had reduced clinical symptoms through the anti-inflammatory properties and recovery of lymphopenia 45 it has also been reported that high doses of chloroquine 600 mg twice daily for 10 days or total dose of 12 g may be associated with significant cardiac risks and should not be recommended for treating covid-19 46 there is still a lack of evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents in treating covid-19 in this regard clinicians and patients should be made aware of the risk versus benefit profile of these medications 47 lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with high specificity for hiv-1 protease lopinavir is marketed and administered exclusively in combination with ritonavir this combination was first marketed by abbott under the brand name kaletra in 2000 48 due to lopinavirs poor oral bioavailability and extensive biotransformation it is co-formulated with ritonavir to enhance its exposure ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the enzymes that are responsible for lopinavir metabolism and its co-administration boosts lopinavir exposure and improves antiviral activity 48 lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule containing a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the hiv-1 protease enzyme but which by itself cannot be cleaved thus preventing the activity of the hiv-1 protease 49 lopinavir-ritonavir was investigated in an open-label individually randomized controlled trial where patients with covid-19 received either lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg100 mg orally twice daily plus standard of care or standard of care alone no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care diarrhea nausea and asthenia were the most frequently reported adverse effects in patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir-based regimen 50 interestingly in a report from korea lopinavir-ritonavir administration significantly decreased coronavirus titers with no or little coronavirus titers were observed in the follow-up study however the analysis included a single patient in the initial phase of outbreak in korea 51 umifenovir branded as arbidol a derivative of indole carboxylic acids was first developed in 1988 in russia and has since been approved in russia and china for treating prophylaxis and infections associated with influenza a and b and other arbovirus 52 later on umifenovir demonstrated in vitro antiviral efficacy in widely spreading virus strains such as the ebola virus human herpesvirus 8 hhv-8 hepatitis c virus hcv and tacaribe arenavirus 53 its major mechanism of action is to block the virus-cell membrane fusion as well as virus-endosome fusion through incorporation into cell membranes and interference with the hydrogen bonding network of phospholipids 54 in influenza virus it has been shown to directly interact with virus particles to stabilize hemagglutinin ha reducing the likelihood of reaching the low ph threshold required for conformational transition into functional fusogenic ha 55 blaising et al reported the in vitro activity of umifenovir against sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 56 57 a retrospective cohort study has reported that compared with lopinavir-ritonavir lpv-rtv only group combination of umifenovir and lpv-rtv has shown increased negative conversion rate of sars-cov-2 and improved chest ct scan results 58 however another prospective study chictr200030254 has shown that compared with favipiravir umifenovir has inferior outcome in clinical recovery rate and relief of fever and cough 59 there are two randomized and open-label trials ongoing in china investigating the efficacy and safety of umifenovir against covid-19 the effect of umifenovir plus standard treatment versus lpv-rtv plus standard treatment will be evaluated in nct04252885 and the effect of umifenovir plus standard treatment versus standard treatment will be tested in nct04260594 favipiravir branded as avigan has been developed by fujifilm toyama chemical in 2014 in japan for the treatment of avian influenza or novel influenza resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors it is a guanine analogue with pyrazinecarboxamide structure and its antiviral activity is decreased at the presence of purine nucleosides due to the competition 60 the prodrug favipiravir first enters the infected cells through endocytosis and is then transformed into active favipiravir ribofuranosyl phosphates through phosphoribosylation and phosphorylation 60 61 the antiviral activity is exhibited through selectively targeting conservative catalytic domain of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp interrupting the nucleotide incorporation process during viral rna replication 60 the dysregulation in viral rna replication results in increased number and frequency of transition mutations including replacement of guanine g by adenine a and cytosine c by thymine t or c by uracil u which induces destructive mutagenesis in rna viruses 60 favipiravir has been used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by rna viruses such as influenza ebola and norovirus 62 recent in vitro and human studies have repurposed favipiravir as an experimental agent against enveloped positive-sense single-strand rna virus sars-cov-2 an in vitro research has investigated seven potential anti-sars-cov-2 medicines including ribavirin penciclovir favipiravir nafamostat nitazoxanide remdesivir and chloroquine showing that remdesivir and chloroquine have favorable selectivity index 30 in addition the study showed favipiravir has exerted efficacy in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 with half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 6188  m and half-cytotoxic concentration cc50 at over 400 m implying the high concentration is needed for safe and effective treatment 30 clinical trials testing favipiravir against covid-19 have been carried out vigorously in various countries including china and japan a randomized control trial chictr200030254 has shown that covid-19 patients treated with favipiravir have superior recovery rate 7143 than that treated with umifenovir 5586 and the duration of fever and cough relief time are significantly shorter in favipiravir group than in umifenovir group 59 up to mid-april 2020 there are eight undergoing clinical trials in china and two in japan examining the anti-sars-cov-2 potential of favipiravir these trials include non-randomized and randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of favipiravir alone

on the surface of the influenza virus to inhibit the spread of the influenza virus in the human body 63 64 a study in wuhan reported that no positive outcomes were observed after receiving antiviral treatment with oseltamivir 65 several clinical trials are still evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating sars-cov-2 infection oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials in several combinations such as with chloroquine and favipiravir 66 azithromycin is an antibiotic that can be used to fight many different types of infections caused by susceptible bacteria such as respiratory infections skin infections and sexually transmitted diseases 68 moreover it has been proven to be active in vitro against zika and ebola viruses and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when treated to patients suffering viral infection 6971 for the mechanism of action azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis it binds to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome thus inhibiting translation of mrna 72 previously azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections eg influenza 73 74 currently many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin conjunction with hydroxychloroquine on the course of disease in people with sars-cov-2 for example pfizer has announced positive data for the use of its azithromycin zithromax drug along with hydroxychloroquine in a covid-19 clinical trial that was performed in france in brief the clinical trial was conducted to assess hydroxychloroquine in 20 patients 6 of which were co-administered with azithromycin compared with 16 controls and 14 hydroxychloroquine alone group the 6 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin presented with highest virologic cure rate following 6-day treatment 73 three other clinical studies used azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily on days 25 co-treated with 10-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily in an open-label non-randomized study in france 6 pts 73 open-label uncontrolled study in france 11 pts 75 and uncontrolled observational study in france 80 pts 76 specifically gautret et al reported a 100 viral clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs in their 6 patients after co-treated of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 73 but the findings reported by molina et al stand in contrast with those reported by gautret molina et al repeated the experiments thought the rapid and full viral clearance was quite unexpected and found 8 of 11 patients had significant comorbidities 75 based on those results data presented to date are insufficient to evaluate possible clinical benefits of azithromycin in patients with covid-19 76 furthermore one must consider the additive cardiac toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin both agents are known to prolong the qt interval and may potentiate the risk for cardiac events in a population known to have cardiac-related comorbidities vitamin c is an essential nutrient and plays significant roles within the human body it can neutralize free radicals and assist to prevent or reverse cellular damage as a potent antioxidant agent it is also involved in some biological processes many of which are associated with immune health 77 moreover vitamin c appears to be effective as an antiviral agent especially against influenza viruses 78 many studies showed that vitamin c positively affects the development and maturation of t lymphocytes and nk natural killer cells involved in the immune response to viral agents it also contributes to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species ros production and to the remodulation of the cytokine network typical of systemic inflammatory syndrome 79 given this background a phase ii clinical trial nct04264533 is initiated in china to evaluate high-dose iv vitamin c in icu patients with severe covid-19-associated pneumonia 80 some hospitals have reported giving infected patients 1500 mg of vitamin c as supportive treatment high-dose iv vitamin c has been given in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe covid-19 patients in china 81 the doses varied between 2 and 10 g per day given over a period of 8-10-h iv infusion the oxygenation index was improved in real time and all the patients eventually recovered and were discharged 81 moreover high-dose 15 mgkg body weight vitamin c has been used for several decades clinically and an nih panel also documented clearly that this dose regimen is safe and has no major side effects 81 82 as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug low doses of methylprednisolone depo-medrol or solu-medrol have the potential to prevent an extended cytokine response and may accelerate resolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in pneumonia 83 84 recently many medical researchers believe that corticosteroids especially methylprednisolone may improve dysregulated immune response caused by sepsis possible complication of infection with covid-19 and increase blood pressure when it is low 85 specifically in a retrospective cohort study 201 patients with confirmed covid-19 who developed ards were treated with methylprednisolone 12 mgkg daily iv for 57 days and the results showed that treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ards in the reduction of the risk of death briefly of those patients with ards who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 46 patients died while those who did not receive methylprednisolone 21 of 34 618 died 86 in another study 46 patients with severe covid-19 that progressed to acute respiratory failure use of methylprednisolone was associated with improvement in clinical symptoms ie fever hypoxia and a shortened disease course in patients who received the drug compared with those who did not 87 moreover according to expert consensus statement from chinese thoracic society dosage regimen of methylprednisolone should be low to moderate ie  05 to 1 mgkg daily or equivalent 88 and the most common regimens of methylprednisolone applied in china were typically 4080 mg iv daily for a course of 36 days 89 the appropriate dosage low dose versus high dose place in therapy early versus late and role for corticosteroids cytokine storm or comorbidity management require additional clarity there is concern that the use of corticosteroids may have deleterious effects ie inhibition of immune response and pathogen clearance in patients with covid-19 83 one study reported no effect on mortality and decreased viral clearance with the use of corticosteroids 24 furthermore the infectious diseases society of american recommends against the routine use of corticosteroids in covid-19 however they do recommend the use of corticosteroids in the setting of ards in the context of a clinical trial 90 similarly the surviving sepsis campaign recommends against corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury in the absence of ards 91 however they provide a recommendation for the use of corticosteroids in patients with ards acknowledging the weak level of evidence dexamethasone has demonstrated utility on ards by decreasing ventilator days and mortality on severe ards in patients without covid-19 92 whether the use of corticosteroids provides similar benefit in patients with covid-19 and ards remains to be seen ultimately the clinical utilization of corticosteroids still needs to be established and should be considered on a case by case basis since patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions are at higher risk of covid-19 and should be closely monitored and cared pulmonary vasodilator agents have been used in some patients for hypoxemia refractory to conventional treatments but no study has been performed specifically on covid-19 patients the surviving sepsis campaign suggested a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator method as rescue therapy in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 severe ards and hypoxemia despite optimized ventilation and other rescue strategies inhaled nitric oxide ino and inhaled epoprostenol iepo a naturally occurring prostaglandin are two common pulmonary vasodilators that have been widely studied 9395 experience in patients with ards indicates that ino can substantially reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve oxygenation in such patients furthermore in vitro evidence of direct antiviral activity against sars-cov was studied and the genetic similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggests their potential effectiveness against sars-cov-2 96 for iepo dosages up to 50 ngkg per minute have been used 93 94 97 98 previous studies reported that to provide a clinically important increase in pao2 and reduction in pulmonary artery pressure the most effective and safe dosage appears to be 2030 ngkg per minute in adults and 30 ngkg per minute in pediatric patients 98 for ino therapy was given for  3 days 30 ppm on day 1 followed by 20 and 10 ppm on days 2 and 3 respectively then weaned on day 4 in a pilot study on sars-cov 99 additionally clinical trials evaluating ino for treatment or prevention of covid-19 are planned or underway nct04305457 nct04306393 nct04312243 100 101 and on march 20 2020 fda granted emergency expanded access allowing its ino delivery system inopulse to be immediately used for the treatment of covid-19 finally additional studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of iepo and ino in the treatment of covid-19 patients sirolimus also known as rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that is used to prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis lam by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin mtor kinase it was originally isolated from the bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus found on easter island rapa nui 102 and is commercially available as rapamune pfizer mtor and more specifically a protein complex mtorc1 formed by mtor plays a key role in viral replication in an in vitro experiment sirolimus has been shown to affect pi3kaktmtor pathway which inhibited mers-cov activity 103 a new randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial scope by university of cincinnati is planned to be conducted between april and september 2020 to test the effect of sirolimus on progression of patients hospitalized with covid-19 to advanced respiratory support 104 studies of patients hospitalized with influenza can further shed light on the antiviral effect of sirolimus in a randomized clinical trial conducted on 38 patients with confirmed h1n1 pneumonia and on mechanical ventilator support a group treated with corticosteroids and 2 mgday of sirolimus for 14 days n  19 showed significantly better clinical outcomes compared with the group treated with corticosteroids only including shorter median duration of ventilator used 105 delayed oseltamivir plus sirolimus treatment in ph1n1-infected mouse model further suggested a significant association between the sirolimus treatment and improved outcomes 106 additionally a new trial by the chinese university of hong kong is planned to begin in august 2020 to investigate the effect of sirolimus and oseltamivir on normalization of respiratory status and changes in biomarkers viral rna concentration 10 cytokineschemokines and pro-inflammatory mediators and several other clinical endpoints in influenza patients 107 at least one in silico study identified sirolimus as one of the 16 potential candidates for treating covid-19 patients based on data from other human coronavirus infections using network-based drug repurposing model 108 tocilizumab branded as actemra is a humanized mab developed by roche and chugai pharmaceutical for treating ra and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients at the time of publishing this article clinicaltrialsgov listed 20 planned studies that included tocilizumab treatment arm all of them at the recruiting stage or earlier a study published in april 2020 reported that 21 severe or critical covid-19 patients in china were treated with the compound with 20 of them recovered at the time of publication and 1 on the way to recovery but still in icu encouraged by these results a larger multicenter clinical trial was launched chictr2000029765 and had about 500 patients treated with tocilizumab already enrolled 109 110 sarilumab branded as kefraza a humanized mab was developed by regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra a phase 23 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was planned by regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi and in partnership with northwell healths feinstein institutes for medical research for march 2020 targeting to enroll 400 covid-19 patients measuring percent change in c-protein phase 2 only and time to improvement on a 7-point scale based on death and type of hospitalization in patients with serum il-6 level above a threshold as primary endpoints as of the time of this publication the results of this study have not been made public 111 anakinra branded as kineret by swedish orphan biovitrum is a modified human il-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra approved in 2001 in the usa and in 2002 in europe for use in ra patients il-1 family of receptors triggers innate immune response and was associated with damaging inflammation 112 out of 5 approved clinical trials involving anakinra treatment 2 also have tocilizumab as a comparison one multicenter open-label non-randomized trial in greece with estimated enrollment of 20 patients 113 and another multicenter randomized open-label trial in belgium with estimated 342 patients has been enrolled to date 114 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor is regarded as an important target in the pathogenesis of covid-19 studies reveal that frequently observed comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes in patients infected with sars-cov-2 are under medication with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker arb 115118 that result in overexpression of ace2 it is speculated that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to human cells via interaction with ace2 receptors 118 119 the opposing physiological actions of ace and ace2 in the renin-angiotensin system are reviewed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of ace2 inhibitors or arbs 120 121 in hypertensive patients chronic treatment with angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r antagonists like losartan lisinopril or olmesartan facilitates cardiac and renal ace2 overexpression according to some in vivo studies 120 122 in contrast sar viral rna following entry into respiratory epithelial cells downregulates the activity of ace2 thereby increasing the levels of angiotensin 2 this may potentially cause severe lung damage 121 123 continued treatment with these drugs may be essential for the survival to attenuate the cardiac stress of advancing covid-19 infection and limit the vasoconstriction and profibrotic effects of angiotensin 2 in alveolar capillaries some of the anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid are activators of ace2 receptors same as ace inhibitors or arbs their usage can lead to increased risk of contracting covid-19 118 since fatal lung failure induced by sars-cov infections may be controlled by blocking renin-angiotensin pathway 123 ibuprofen may not be harmful however there is no strong evidence suggesting a link between intake of an nsaid and worsening symptoms due to infection caused by sars-cov-2 the fda considers ibuprofen and the likes as a potentially promising therapeutic agent against covid-19 124 studies have demonstrated that thiazolidinedione and its derivatives which are type 2 diabetes mellitus drugs show efficacious effect against pulmonary disease induced by respiratory syncytial virus rsv or h1n1 influenza infection 125 126 but their role as a therapeutic drug against coronavirus is not yet explored interestingly it is known that thiazolidinediones may have the potential to upregulate ace2 receptor which is identified as a binding target for sars-cov-2 in host cells 118 however lack of clinical evidence makes it uncertain to determine its therapeutic efficacy against coronavirus infections amici et al have demonstrated that indomethacin a well-known nsaid and a potential cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor exhibits antiviral activity against sars-cov and canine coronavirus ccov in vitro studies suggest that indomethacin exhibits dose-dependent response in canine a72 cell monolayers infected with ccov with an ic50 of 5 um after 24 h of exposure also remarkable inhibition against sars-cov-infected vero cells by more than 99 at concentrations that were non-toxic for uninfected cells is also observed in addition indomethacin significantly blocks viral rna synthesis in dogs infected with ccov following oral administration of the drug 1 mgkg 127 this suggests probable efficacy of indomethacin against sars-cov-2 127 colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for gout management and a variety of other conditions sharing similar pathophysiology its mechanisms of action are related to interfering with migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation and blocking the inflammasome complex in both neutrophils and monocytes thus reducing il-1beta activation 128 colchicine also has inhibitory effects on macrophages via the inhibition of the nacht-lrrpyd-containing protein 3 nalp3 inflammasome and pore formation activated by purinergic receptors p2x7 and p2x2 there may also be beneficial effects on endothelial function due to colchicines anti-fibrotic activities some patients with covid-19 present with myopathies and colchicine has been shown to reduce inflammation in the cardiac myocytes 129 there are several ongoing studies investigating colchicine for cytokine storm nct04326790 nct04322682 nct04322565 niclosamide an anthelmintic drug has been shown to be an effective sars-cov virus replication inhibitor at dose concentration of 156 um or higher in vero e6 cells without interfering with binding of corona virus onto the cells 130 another study reveals the efficacy of niclosamide in inhibiting mers-cov replication in verob4 cells via reduction of skp2 regulated becn1 ubiquitination and enhancement of autophagic flux and its ic50 value is determined to be 03 um 131 thus the possibility of niclosamide to inhibit sars-cov-2 cannot be neglected ivermectin a potent anthelmintic drug was first discovered to inhibit interaction between integrase in molecule of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 and its nuclear transport receptor importin  132 further studies exhibit its potential to prevent viral replication of a broad spectrum of viruses including dengue virus flavivirus and influenza 133135 very recently ivermectin has shown inhibition against sars-cov-2 up to 5000-fold at 48 h in vitro inhibition of imp1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins is suggested as the probable cause of its antiviral activity 136 it will be interesting to know its inhibition effect against sars-cov-2 in vivo both nitazoxanide and its metabolite and tizoxanide have shown inhibitory effects against mers-cov in llc-mk2 cells besides inhibition of other corona virus strains including murine corona virus mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 mhv-a59 bovine corona virus strain l9 bcov-l9 and human enteric corona virus 4408 hecov-4408 by nitazoxanide is reported via suppression of viral n protein 137 nitazoxanide is found to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and il-6 in vivo however the relevance of this information is currently unknown 138 this treatment option refers to transfusion of plasma loaded with antibodies from individuals after resolution from a specific pathogen this technique has been used for decades 139 transfusion can offer a short-term immediate immunity for individuals convalescent plasma can be used prophylactically and for already infected patients to attenuate clinical severity 140 141 mechanism of action is through binding of the transfused antibodies to the pathogen resulting in cellular cytotoxicity phagocytosis or direct neutralization of the pathogen 142 143 previously convalescent plasma was used for two coronaviruses sars-cov and mers 144 one large study in hong kong involving 80 patients with sars-cov supported early administration of antibodies for optimal clinical effect compared to later administration 145 limited data from taiwan and south korea showed clinical benefits in severe cases of sars-cov and mers 146 147 reported dosage varied widely in terms of the amount of plasma transfused and antibody titer 148 limited data on covid-19 patients from china illustrated clinical benefits 149 150 pilot study reported clinical improvement in terms of fever cough tightness of breath and chest pain while no serious side effects were reported 150 there has been considerable attention placed on the role of hypercoagulable state leading to micro- and macro-vascular thrombosis in covid-19 disseminated intravascular coagulation and elevated d-dimer level were identified as predictors of worse outcomes in a cohort study of patients with covid-19 151 patients receiving anticoagulants had a decreased mortality 152 heparin has anti-inflammatory properties and may also inhibit viral attachment via conformational changes to the sars-cov-2 surface receptor spike s1 153 low molecular weight heparin in patients hospitalized with covid-19 was associated with lower serum il-6 concentrations suggesting that there may be an added mechanism besides preventiontreatment of thrombosis 154 based on available evidence it is reasonable to administer venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with either a low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin in hospitalized patients in patients with rapidly progressing respiratory deterioration or where clinical judgment suggests thrombosis treatment doses of anticoagulants may be considered the covid-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis in the past 100 years hopefully vaccines and or specific therapeutic drugs targeting sars-cov-2 will be made available in the next few months or years with the speed and volume of basic and clinical covid-19sars-cov-2 research to develop potential drugs and therapies for this disease our hope will be on the horizon  pharmacotherapics advice in guidelines for

of china 2020i to date there is still no approved specific antiviral drug for covid-19 and providing supportive care to help relieve symptoms is the most vital strategy for covid-19 treatment in this article we summarize the pharmacotherapy guidelines for covid-19 highlight the updates to the pharmacotherapy guidelines and reviewed the efficacy and safety of the anti-covid-19 drugs recommended remdesivir a nucleoside analog inhibits rna replicase polyprotein 1ab agostini et al 2018 it was originally developed for the treatment of the ebola virus warren et al 2016 remdesivir has a superior anti-mers activity compared to lopinavir and ritonavir in vitro and in vivo sheahan et al 2020 and displayed anti-sars-cov-2 ability in vitro wang m et al 2020 the first covid-19 case in the usa used remdesivir and clinical condition improved from the 2nd day of remdesivir medication holshue et al 2020 it has been assessed in rcts in both china and the usa nih 2020 however it showed different results in china and the usa remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits or adverse events for 237 adult patients admitted to hospital for severe covid-19 in the rct enrolled in china wang y et al 2020 in the usa compassionate use of remdesivir displayed clinical improvement in 36 of 53 hospitalized severe covid-19 patients grein et al 2020 and 14 of 17 patients in the infectious disease ward antinori et al 2020 in an rct with 1063 patients enrolled in the usa remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection also an ethnic difference was observed remdesivir is effective among white patients and is not significantly effective among black and asian patients beigel et al 2020 the guideline from italy recommended remdesivir italian society of infectious and tropical diseases section 2020 and the fda approved emergency use authorization eua of remdesivir for the treatment of covid-19 fda 2020 in short remdesivir is helpful but not a wonder drug for covid-19 patients mahase 2020 favipiravir is a modified pyrazine analog and was initially approved for therapeutic use in resistant cases of influenza it targets rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp enzymes and inhibits the transcription and replication of viral genomes furuta et al 2017 cai et al found that favipiravir showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with lopinavirritonavir for the treatment of covid-19 35 vs 45 patients chen et al found the favipiravir did not significantly improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7 compared to arbidol but significantly improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough in a 120 vs 120 patient trial chen et al 2020 however lou et al did not observe clinical improvement with favipiravir treatment for covid-19 patients lou et al 2020 there is still a lack of sufficient evidence to support the clinical anti-covid-19 effects of favipiravir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are canonical quinoline antiparasitic drugs indicated to treat infections of malaria and also used off-label for the treatment of rheumatic diseases and lupus erythematosus besides andrea savarino et al demonstrated the potential therapeutic benefits of chloroquine in viral diseases te et al 2007 including sars savarino et al 2003 thus it has been re-purposed for the prophylaxis and treatment of zika virus infection li et al 2017 wang et al reported that chloroquine effectively inhibits sars-cov-2 infection by increasing endosomal ph and interfering with the glycosylation of cellular ace2 receptors wang m et al 2020 the blood concentration of chloroquine can reach the ec90 value of anti-sars-cov-2 with regular dosing for rheumatoid arthritis wang m et al 2020 in several clinical trials chloroquine has been proved to inhibit the sars-cov-2 virus in vivo gao et al 2020 therefore it was included in the chinese guidelines for the first time in the 6th edition concerning the toxicity of chloroquine the dose recommended by the chinese guidelines was updated in the 7th edition riou et al 1988 also an expert consensus statement from shanghai recommended hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine cutler et al 1988 shanghai clinical treatment expert group for corona virus disease 2019 2020 the italian guidelines recommended chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when chloroquine is not available italian society of infectious and tropical diseases section 2020 the fda approved the eua of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 fda 2020 however there is still controversy about the effect and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine mehra and colleagues have not found a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or with a macrolide for in-hospital outcomes for covid-19n96 032 mehra et al 2020 in an observational study with 1446 hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite endpoint of intubation or death tang et al 2020 the american college of physicians suggested that clinicians should not use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin as a treatment of patients with covid-19 due to the known harms and there being no available evidence of benefits in patients with covid-19 qaseem et al 2020 abidol also called umifenovir is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by a russian pharmaceutical company and approved for marketing in russia and china brooks et al 2012 it was licensed for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections brooks et al 2012 its mechanisms of antiviral action including interactions with certain amino acid residues to form a hydrophobic aromatic stacking structure and interactions with aromatic residues of the viral glycoproteins involved in fusion and cellular recognitionkadam and wilson 2017 zeng et al 2017 its antiviral ability in the treatment of various virus infections including sars khamitov et al 2008 and ebola virus hulseberg et al 2019 has been studied and proved some studies have observed anti-covid-19 potential in vitro and in clinic wang z et al 2020 chinese guidelines recommended abidol for anti-covid-19

covid-19 moreover covid-19 is still a pandemic as of may 2020 and it will probably become a periodic epidemic the development of anti-covid-19 drugs is one of the most important tasks to be done however the duration of new drug discovery and development usually last years or even decades the re-purposed use and re-discovery of marketed drugs has become an expressway for anti-covid-19 drug development when covid-19 broke out in china clinicians and researchers lacked knowledge of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 at that time saving lives was the most important thing to be considered many un-approved treatments were therefore tested in the clinic based on the experience of sars and in vitro studies as the evidence grew many drugs were not proved to be effective treatments for covid-19 also chloroquine lopinavirritonavir and other drugs have been reported to have toxic effects this is why there have been seven editions of the chinese guidelines when covid-19 broke out in europe and american in the second wave clinicians had already gained more knowledge and could avoid unnecessary tests through evidence-based medicine european and americans have also developed corresponding guidelines for covid-19 there is much to be learned from the self-renewal and self-improvement practices of medical staff under the covid-19 pandemic the process of updating guidelines is not only

elfiky 2020b is to interact with the host cells such as the pulmonary and parabronchial epithelial cell and assists the coronavirus to enter through the epithelial cell membrane boopathi et al 2020 xia et al 2020 moreover the alveolar epithelial cells have ample expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is an aim by the virus the detection of ace2 by the s protein of the virus permits the invasion of the coronavirus into the human circulation system belouzard et al 2009 single-strand rna 2226 kilobases viruses such as the coronavirus family reproduce the virus genomes by capitalizing on host cells for instance after coronavirus comes near the ribosome of the epithelial cells or other host cells it utilizes the ribosome of the host cell to replicate polyproteins the replication and ensuing procedures of precursor polyproteins can arise in the epithelial cells hoffmann et al 2020 wahedi et al 2020 after the coronavirus polyproteins are exhibited two enzymes coronavirus main proteinase 3clpro and the papain-like protease plpro are believed to be involved in cleaving the polyproteins into smaller products used for replicating new viruses in order to produce the daughter rna genome the coronavirus exhibits an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp which is an important replicase that catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary rna strand using the virus

mechanism of action figure 2 agostini et al 2018 jordan et al 2018 siegel et al2017 tchesnokov et al 2019 recently gordon tchesnokov woolner et al 2020 proved that rdrp effectively incorporates the active triphosphate form of rdv rdv-tp into rna causing termination of rna synthesis the investigators obtained almost identical results with sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 rdrps and concluded that the distinguished property of rdv-tp is its high discernment over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart atp rdv formerly known as gs-5734 is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog that was developed in response to the ebola outbreak in west africa from 2014 rdv binds to rdrp and acts as rna chain terminator it exhibits effective in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 with

suppressor of sars-cov-2 viral replication that synergizes remdesivir the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus is a global threat to human health by in vitro screening and biochemical characterization we identified the hepatitis c virus hcv protease inhibitor simeprevir as an especially promising repurposable drug for treating covid-19 we also revealed that simeprevir synergizes with the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor remdesivir to suppress the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro our results provide preclinical rationale for the combination treatment of simeprevir and remdesivir for the pharmacological management of covid-19 patients  the recent outbreak of infection by the novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread to almost all countries and claimed more than 260000 lives worldwide who situation report 107 may 6 2020  alarming features of covid-19 include a high risk of clustered outbreak both in community and nosocomial settings and up to one-fifth severecritically ill proportion of symptomatic inpatients reported 1-4 furthermore a significant proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic substantially delaying their diagnoses hence facilitating the widespread dissemination of covid-19 5  with a dire need for effective therapeutics that can reduce both clinical severity and viral shedding numerous antiviral candidates have been under clinical trials or in compassionate use for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 6  several antivirals under study are hypothesized or proven to target the key mediator of a specific step in the sars-cov-2 viral replication cycle for instance lopinavirritonavir lpvr and danoprevir have been proposed to inhibit the sars-cov-2 main protease m pro  also called 3cl pro  needed for the maturation of multiple viral proteins chloroquine cq  hydroxychloroquine hcq alone or combined with azithromycin az may abrogate viral replication by inhibiting endosomal acidification crucial for viral entry 7 8  nucleoside analogues such as remdesivir ribavirin favipiravir and eidd-2801 likely inhibit the sars-cov-2 nsp12 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp andor induce lethal mutations during viral rna replication 9 10 11  unfortunately on the clinical aspect lpvr failed to demonstrate clinical benefits in well-powered randomized controlled trials rcts while hcq andor az also failed to demonstrate benefits in observational studies 12 13 14  meanwhile lpvr cqhcq and az may even increase the incidence of adverse events 14 15 16  although remdesivir is widely considered one of the most promising candidates latest rcts only revealed marginal shortening of disease duration in patients treated 17  therefore further efforts are required to search for more potent readily repurposable therapeutic agents for sars-cov-2 infection either as sole therapy or im combination with other drugs to enhance their efficacy ideally the candidate drugs need to be readily available as intravenous andor oral formulations possess favourable pharmacokinetics properties as anti-infectives and do not cause adverse events during the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection eg non-specific immunosuppression arrhythmia or respiratory side effects two complementary approaches have been adopted to identify novel drugs or compounds that can suppress sars-cov-2 replication one approach relies on in vitro profiling of the antiviral efficacy of up to thousands of compounds in early clinical development or drugs already approved by the us food and drug administration fda 18 19 20 21 22  on the other hand as the crystal structure of the m pro 23 24  papain-like protease pl pro  25 and the cryo-em structure of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 rdrp complex 11 26 of the sars-cov-2 virus became available the structurebased development of their specific inhibitors becomes feasible structure-aided screening will enable the discovery of novel compounds as highly potent inhibitors 27 as well as the repurposing of readily available drugs as anti-cov agents for fast-track clinical trials here we report our results regarding the discovery of fda-approved drugs potentially active against the sars-cov-2 in vitro and cellular results led to the identification of simeprevir a hepatitis c virus hcv ns3a4 protease inhibitor 28  as a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 replication in a cellular model of infection importantly simeprevir acts synergistically with remdesivir whereby the effective dose of remdesivr could be lowered by multiple-fold by simeprevir at physiologically feasible concentrations interestingly biochemical and molecular characterizations revealed that simeprevir only weakly inhibits m pro  while no inhibition of either the pl pro or the rdrp polymerase activity was found the anti-sars-cov-2 mechanism of simeprevir thus awaits further investigations and may provide hints on novel antiviral strategies given our goal of identifying immediately usable and practical drugs against sars-cov-2 we prioritized a list of repurposing drug candidates for in vitro testing based on joint considerations on safety pharmacokinetics drug formulation availability and feasibility of rapidly conducting trials table  s1  we focused on fda-approved antivirals including simeprevir saquinavir daclatasvir ribavirin sofosbuvir and zidovudine and drugs whose primary indication was not antiviral but had reported antiviral activity including bromocriptine and atovaquone remdesivir was also tested for comparison of efficacy and as a positive control in the vero e6 cellular infection model we found simeprevir as the only drug among our prioritized candidates that showed potent suppression of sars-cov-2 replication in the  10 m range fig 1a  more detailed dose-response characterization found simeprevir has a potency comparable to remdesivir in our experiment fig 1b  the half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of simeprevir was determined to be 408 m while the 50 cytotoxicity concentration cc50 was 1933 m which the latter is consistent with previously reported values in other human cell lines 29 fig 1b  these data suggest that a desirable therapeutic window exists for the suppression of sars-cov-2 replication with simeprevir  while simeprevir is a potential candidate for clinical use alone we hypothesized that it may be used to create a synergistic effect with remdesivir thereby mitigating its reported adverse effects 17 improving its efficacy and broadening its applicability indeed combining simeprevir and remdesivir at various concentrations apparently provided much greater suppression of sars-cov-2 replication than remdesivir alone while they did not synergize to increase cytotoxicity  fig 2a  importantly such effects were not merely additive as the excess over bliss score suggested synergism at 33 m simeprevir and 11 -10 m remdesivir in suppressing sars-cov-2 replication fig 2b   the desirable anti-sars-cov-2 effect of simeprevir prompted us to determine its mechanism of action given that simeprevir is an hcv ns34a protease inhibitor we first investigated its inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 m pro and pl pro using established in vitro assays 30 31 fig 3a c e  we found inhibition of m pro by simeprevir with half-maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of 96  23 m fig 3b  two times higher than the ec50 determined from our cell-based assay the substrate cleavage was further verified with sds-page supplementary fig 2  docking simeprevir against the apo protein crystal structure of sars-cov-2 m pro pdb id 6yb7 resolution 125  suggested a putative binding mode with a score of -99 kcal mol -1 supplementary fig 3  this binding mode is consistent with a recent docking study using a homology model of sars-cov-2 m pro 32  on the other hand no inhibition of pl pro activity was observed even at above 20 m of simeprevir fig 3d  we speculated that the weak inhibition of m pro protease activity by simeprevir could not fully account for its antiviral effect towards sars-cov-2 to search for further mechanistic explanations we next docked simeprevir alongside several other drug candidates and nucleoside analogues remdesivir ribavirin and favipiravir against the motif f active site of the cryo-em structure of the sars-cov-2 nsp12 rdrp supplementary fig 4a  interestingly the docking results revealed that simeprevir had a higher score than the nucleoside analogues supplementary fig 4b  to test this experimentally we adopted previously reported protocols and constructed an rdrp primer extension assay using recombinant sars-cov-2 nsp12 nsp7 and nsp8 intriguingly simeprevir showed no inhibition of rdrp polymerase activity at concentrations as high as 500 m fig 3f  since simeprevir only weakly inhibits m pro and does not inhibit the enzyme activities of sars-cov-2 rdrp or pl pro in vitro it may function by targeting other host or viral proteins  the sars-cov-2 has gone from an emerging infection to a global pandemic as a novel pathogen with high transmissibility it is essential to reduce the casualties by effective pharmacological management our study has successfully identified the readily repurposable clinically practical antiviral simeprevir that could target sars-cov-2 specifically we found a fourth-order suppression of viral genome copies by simeprevir at  10 m in a cell-based viral replication assay -a concentration that is expected to be attainable in human lung tissues with  150mg daily dosing based on available pharmacokinetic data 33 34  in addition we discovered that simeprevir can synergize with remdesivir in inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication in a cellular model potentially allowing lower doses of both drugs to be used to treat covid-19 in a global pandemic with patients having diverse clinical characteristics providing an additional option to remdesivir and the flexibility of combined simeprevir-remdesivir use will be exceptionally important to treat those who are intolerant or not responding to the drug 17  which can easily amount to tens of thousands of patients given the widespread disease as there is only one confirmed and approved therapy for covid-19 a potentially repurposable drug can be rapidly tested in animal models before clinical trials to prepare for supply shortages or when remdesivir-resistant mutations arise we note however there are also several disadvantages of simeprevir and the proposed simeprevir-remdesivir combination simeprevir requires dose adjustments in patients with child-pugh class b or c cirrhosis as well as in patients with east asian ancestry 33  in addition simeprevir has been taken off the market since 2018 due to the appearance of next-generation hcv protease inhibitors hence its supply may not be ramped up easily as simeprevir is only available in an oral capsule formulation it cannot be easily administered in the most severe patients who may be intubated finally simeprevir is metabolized by the cyp3a4 enzyme with saturable kinetics 33 while remdesivir itself is not only a substrate of cyp3a4 and esterases but also a cyp3a4 inhibitor whether such theoretical pharmacokinetic interaction will exacerbate liver toxicity or provide additional pharmacokinetic synergy in addition to pharmacodynamic synergy in vivo remains to be tested mechanistically we found unexpected complexity in the inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication by simeprevir -it does not inhibit the sars-cov-2 viral proteins pl pro or rdrp at physiologically feasible concentrations simeprevir is a weak inhibitor of m pro at 10 m in keeping with the ic50 at 137 m as determined in a parallel study 31  this potency of m pro inhibition unlikely accounts for the strong suppression of sars-cov-2 viral replication observed therefore further investigation of the mechanism of action of simeprevir can uncover new druggable targets for inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication  sars-cov-2 virus betacovhong kongvm200010612020 scov2 was isolated from the nasopharynx aspirate and throat swab of

fsx bmg labtech  rational design of the remdesivir binding site in the rna-dependent rna polymerase of sars-cov-2 implications for potential resistance aditya padhi k shukla rohit timir 2  tripathi  sars-cov-2 is rapidly evolving with the continuous emergence of new mutations there is no specific antiviral therapy for covid-19 and the use of remdesivir for treating covid-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of remdesivir resistance we used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the remdesivir-binding site in nsp12 after designing 56 residues in the remdesivir binding site of nsp12 the designs retained 96-98 sequence identity which suggests that sars-cov-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12 we also identified affinity-attenuating remdesivir binding designs of nsp12 several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with remdesivir which suggested drug resistance these hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop remdesivir and related drug-based resistance a comparison of 21 nsp12 remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 eidd-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that eidd-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape combined with the availability of more genomic data our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis  the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 is a highly infectious acute respiratory disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses covs such as sars-cov bat and pangolin covs however evolutionary genomics indicates that the affinity of the spike protein s-protein of sars-cov-2 for its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is much higher than the s-protein of other covs which results in a higher infectivity rate of sars-cov-2 1 of covs nsp12 forms a complex with two additional proteins nsp7 and nsp8 and participates in the rna template-dependent synthesis of viral rna in the presence of divalent metal ions 5 6 7  the binding of nsp12 to nsp7 and nsp8 enhances the template binding and processivity of nsp12 5 8  the structure of sars-cov-2 nsp12 shares a high homology with nsp12 of sars-cov which indicates that they have similar functions and mechanisms of action 9  the structures of the rdrp nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 in the apo-form 8 10 and complex form with the template primer rna remdesivir and mg 2 ions were determined recently 11  the n-terminus of the nsp12 polymerase has a -hairpin structure residues 31-50 and an extended nidovirus rdrp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain niran residues 115-250 that consists of seven -helices and three -strands 8 10 12  the niran domain binds at the backside of the cupped right-handed c-terminal rdrp via an interface domain residues 251 to 365 that links the niran domain to the finger subdomain of the c-terminal rdrp the c-terminal rdrp residues 366-920 is divided into three subdomains finger residues 398-581 and 621-679 palm residues 582-627 and 688-815 and thumb subdomain residues 816-919 which is a conserved architecture of all viral rdrps the long finger extension of cov rdrp intersects with the thumb subdomain to form a closed ring structure this conformation is in contrast to the smaller loop in the rdrp of other rna viruses such as influenza virus that has a relatively open conformation two zinc ions also bind in the conserved metal-binding motif in all cov rdrps and play a crucial role in maintaining rdrp stability and structural integrity 8  the overall structural architecture of the apo-rdrp without remdesivir and complex-rdrp with remdesivir is similar except nsp12 is in the closed conformation in apo-rdrp the binding of nsp7 and nsp8 stabilizes the closed conformation remdesivir in its monophosphate form rmp forms a covalent bond with the 3 end of the rna primer strand at the 1 position via base-stacking interactions and with the uridine base from the template strand via two hydrogen bonds rmp also interacts with side chains from lys545 and arg555 two mg 2 ions and one pyrophosphate are present near the bound rmp the mg 2 ions interact with the phosphodiester backbone and form part of the active site the catalytic site of rdrp consists of seven conserved motifs a-g with crucial residues that are required for the activity of rdrp the residues constituting the catalytic site and the residues involved in rna binding are highly conserved in covs most rdrp inhibitors interact with the residues of these conserved motifs remdesivir is a nucleotide analog antiviral prodrug upon diffusion into a cell it is converted to gs-441524 monophosphate which is phosphorylated to the active nucleotide triphosphate form of remdesivir rtp binding of rtp leads to the inhibition of rdrp activity via nonobligate rna chain termination 13 14  rtp covalently binds to the 1 position and delays chain termination between positions 3 and 5 rtp inhibits the rdrp of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with similar efficiency and mechanism of action 14  another recent nucleoside analog inhibitor eidd-2801 was effective against remdesivir-resistant sars-cov-2 eidd-2801 reduced the replication and pathogenesis of covs in a manner similar to remdesivir 15  viruses tend to adapt under drug pressure and increase the mutation rate to increase the chance per mutation of creating a beneficial mutation this strategy ultimately leads to the development of variations for natural selection to act and create an evolving virus that is resistant to drug effects recent data revealed that several residues in nsp12 had mutated in sars-cov-2 mutations in the remdesivir-binding site in nsp12 may induce resistance against the drug the present work used high-throughput computational approaches to design remdesivir-binding sites in nsp12 and identify novel affinity-attenuating mutations the data provide crucial insights into the residues that showed a very high tendency to undergo positive selection leading to remdesivir resistance the work is important to understand and manage remdesivir resistance and may guide scientists for rational structure-based drug discovery the interacting residues between nsp12 and remdesivir were obtained from the cryo-em structure of the sars cov-2 rdrp a total of 56 residues from nsp12 interacted with remdesivir fig 1a  notably certain nsp12 residues such as ala558 gly559 ser682 gly683 asp684 ser759 asp760 asp761 cys813 and ser814 interacted with remdesivir and template-primer rna a ligand-interaction diagram further revealed that the crucial residues of nsp12 were located within a 6- distance of remdesivir and highlighted the metal coordination with mg 2  the hydrogen bond with asn691 and u10 of rna and a pi-pi stacking interaction with u20 of the template-primer rna  fig 1b and 1c  ligand-based interface design of the remdesivir-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-rna complex and associated physicochemical features of the complex we performed a ligand-based interface design of the remdesivir binding site residues of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-rna complex remdesivir formed key contacts and interactions with 56 residues of nsp12 notably 10 of these 56 residues also interacted with template-primer rna therefore the 56 interface residues of remdesivir that bound nsp12 were designed to allow the backbone flexibility of nsp12 and the residues of nsp12 other than the interface residues were repacked a total of 50000 designs from the interface design were computed for rosettas total scores rmsd interface delta and sequence identity and analyzed in detail first the 50000 designs of remdesivir-bound nsp12 were sampled by computing the total scores versus the rmsd and all of the designs exhibited rmsd 15   fig 2a  notably more than half of the top-scored designs showed deviations in their rmsds below 1  which suggests that the designs did not deviate significantly from the starting complex structure during repacking backbone movements and packing and maintained their structural integrity even after the introduction of mutations in the 56 interface residues of nsp12  fig   2a  to filter the affinity-attenuating designs from the affinity-enhancing designs we performed a control experiment in which we only repacked without designing the same 56 residues of nsp12 we noted that there were designs that had poor total scores than the control and relatively higher rmsds even compared to the affinity-enhancing designs which suggests that the affinity-attenuating designs exhibited slight deviation in their overall structure from the starting structure and reached unfavored energetic states upon mutation second the binding affinity of the designs represented as the interface delta was computed and plotted against the total scores fig 2b  the affinity-attenuating designs had a significantly lower binding affinity than the affinity-enhancing designs and the control in the design calculations fig 2b  third our computation of the rmsd versus the interface delta of the 50000 designs revealed that the designs with lower binding affinities exhibited relatively higher rmsds fig   2c  while a significant number of the designed structures had improved binding affinities several designed structures had reduced binding affinities with rmsds above 1  as compared to the control group structures without design suggesting that the mutations destabilized the intermolecular interactions with remdesivir fig 2c  finally we evaluated the interface delta binding affinity of the designs to compare the affinities with the sequence identities from the native sequence although remdesivir had contacts with many nsp12 residues only a few of the nsp12 residues were more prone to mutations fig 2d  the designs exhibited an overall sequence identity between 96-98 and the lower affinity binders were less conserved than the higher affinity designs this result suggests that although nsp12 may acquire fewer mutations at the remdesivir binding site certain residues are highly prone to mutations and develop resistance against remdesivir however these residues can mutate whenever the virus experiences evolutionary and immune pressure during evolution to validate the predictive quality and accuracy of our ligand-based interface design methodology a previously reported remdesivir-resistant mutant of sars cov v557l was examined 15  val557 of nsp12 is conserved in sars cov-2 and it may mutate to leu557 or any other remdesivir-resistant mutation to examine whether our methodology would design and rank order leu557 as one of the low-scored designs we scored and scanned residues in the 557 th position and found that v557l was ranked as a low-scored design in the design calculations fig s1  this result demonstrated that our methodology was capable of scoring rank-ordering and filtering the resistance-enhancing mutations from that of the possible resistance-attenuating mutations the 50000 designs that were generated surrounding the remdesivir-binding site of nsp12 were classified into affinity-attenuating and affinity-enhancing designs the 56 interacting amino acid residues of the 100 top-scored affinity-attenuating designs were analyzed and compared with the 100 top-scored affinity-enhancing designs with a higher total score and binding affinities a mutational landscape analysis revealed that residues tyr456 asn543-ser549 lys551 ala554-thr556 gly559 val560 asp618-lys621 ala625 gly679 ser681 ser682-thr686 tyr689 ser692 asn695 ser759 asp761 ala762 asn790 glu811 phe812 and ser814 were sampled to almost identical residues in both groups and they varied most at the remaining residues fig 3  notably some residues such as arg553 val557 ala558 trp617 arg631 val662 and phe694 exhibited diverse mutations between the two groups but with a smaller number of amino acids sampled in these positions other residues including ile589 cys622 asp623 arg624 met626 thr680 ser682 thr687 ala688 ala690 asn691 leu758 asp760 and cys813 experienced more diverse sequence variations between the two groups with a relatively higher number of amino acids sampled fig 3  notably motif a residues 613-626 and motif b residues 675-710 were more prone and highly susceptible to mutations and the catalytic residues ser759 and asp761 which also interact with primer rna were completely conserved fig 3  twenty-one residue positions of nsp12 varied between the affinity-attenuating and affinity-enhancing designs this mutational landscape data between the affinity-attenuating and affinity-enhancing designs showed that certain amino acids and positions in the nsp12 were highly prone to mutations and even accommodated a higher number of variations for example the r553s a558s and a690d mutations that were sampled in the affinity-attenuating designs were already identified in the sars-cov-2 genomes as reported in the cov-glue database which contains replacements insertions and deletions and were observed in the gisaid hcov-19 sequences sampled from the pandemic httpcov-gluecvrglaacukreplacement which suggests that these viruses are probably resistant to remdesivir fig 3  this sequence-specific conservation and diversity of the remdesivir-bound nsp12 designs show the design accuracy and predictive capability of our design methodology which suggests that these hotspot residues will likely undergo selective mutations in the near future to develop remdesivir and related drug-based resistance for the propagation of infection and survival of sars-cov-2 after the rosetta ligand-based interface design calculations we computed the binding affinities between remdesivir and all of the rosetta-generated designs using prodigy-lig we found that the binding affinities of remdesivir-bound designs ranged from -501 kcalmol to -635 kcalmol fig s2  several affinity-attenuating designs generated from rosetta also had lower binding affinities in prodigy-lig scoring for the wild-type remdesivir-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-rna complex the binding affinity between nsp12 and remdesivir was -602 kcalmol with a total of 2862 atomic contacts interestingly while many of the top designs had a substantial increase in binding affinity there were several affinity-attenuating designs with reduced binding affinity with remdesivir fig s2  to compare how the top-scored affinity-attenuating remdesivir-bound designs differ from the top-scored affinity-enhancing designs we were interested in visualizing the various types of intermolecular interactions between them the number of intermolecular interactions that determine these variations were also computed the affinity-enhancing design formed 349 interactions and the affinity-attenuating design formed only 260 interactions in total table 1  proximal interactions polar contacts hydrogen bonds and aromatic contacts were the major interactions that governed the increased or decreased affinity between remdesivir and nsp12  fig 4a and 4b  a ligand interaction diagram between remdesivir and nsp12 for the affinityenhancing and affinity-attenuating designs shows that the lack of a pi-pi stacking interaction between remdesivir and his682 of nsp12 was one of the major contributors to lower binding affinity in the affinity-attenuating design  fig 4c and 4d  the antiviral drug eidd-2801 was docked into the remdesivir binding site of sars-cov-2 rdrp and eid-2801 and remdesivir shared several common interactions with nsp12 including hydrogen bonds with asn691 and the u10 and u20 of the primer rna eidd-2801 also established a unique hydrogen bond with ser159  fig 5a and 5b  because eidd-2801 shared a significant number of similar interactions with remdesivir fig 5c  we performed a ligand-based interface design of eidd-2801 binding site residues of nsp12 and found 65 contacts and interactions with nsp12 the identical design condition and methodology used in the remdesivir-based nsp12 design was performed and 50000 designs from the interface designs were computed for rosetta total score rmsd interface delta and sequence identity similar to the remdesivir-bound nsp12 designs we first sampled the 50000 designs of eidd-2801-bound nsp12 by computing the total scores versus the rmsd fig s3a  we also performed a control experiment in which we only repacked the same 65 residues of nsp12 and considered the designs that were poorer in total score and binding affinity we found that the designs with higher-energy also exhibited rmsds far from the native 10  our subsequent calculations of total score versus interface delta which showed the binding affinity demonstrated that the lower binding affinity designs retained relatively higher energies and a substantial number of designs had lower binding affinity compared to the control group structures fig s3b  we analyzed and plotted the rmsd versus the interface delta of the designs and observed that the designs with significantly lower binding affinities for eidd-2801 were structurally a bit far from the native structures fig s3c  more than half of the designs scored poorer than the control group which showed the effect of mutations in the eidd-2801 binding site of nsp12 the final evaluation of the binding affinities compared to the sequence identity of the designs revealed similar characteristics to the remdesivir-binding nsp12 designs in which only four residues were more prone to mutations fig s3d  this result suggests that a few residues of nsp12 from sars-cov-2 are more susceptible to mutations at the eidd-2801 binding site and may develop resistance via beneficial mutations to avoid evolutionary and external pressure the 50000 designs that were generated surrounding the eidd-2801 binding site of nsp12 were classified into affinity-enhancing and affinity-attenuating designs similar to remdesivir the 65 interacting amino acid residues of the 100 top-scored affinity-enhancing and affinity-attenuating designs from each group were analyzed a mutational landscape analysis revealed that residues arg555 val557 val560 tyr619 met626 ser682 thr687 ala688 asn691 phe694 and asn695 exhibited diverse mutations between the two groups but with a fewer number of amino acids sampled in these positions fig s4  notably some other residues including lys545 and cys622 exhibited more diverse sequence variations between the two groups and with a relatively higher number of amino acids sampled fig s4  thirteen residue positions of nsp12 varied between the affinity-enhancing and affinity-attenuating designs compared to 21 residues in the remdesivir-bound nsp12 designs this mutational landscape data between the affinity-attenuating and affinity-enhancing designs shows that remdesivir binding sites of nsp12 had a higher number of mutations and the eidd-2801 binding site residues of nsp12 were relatively immune to mutations our binding affinity calculations using prodigy-lig for the eidd-2801-bound designs showed that the designs exhibited binding affinities that ranged from -626 kcalmol to -727 kcalmol fig s5  with the decrease in the number of total contacts the binding affinities were decreased however the difference in the binding affinity of the remdesivirbound designs was higher -134 kcalmol compared to the eidd-2801-bound designs -101 kcalmol we visualized the various types of intermolecular interactions between the top-scored affinity-enhancing designs of eidd-2801 and the top-scored affinity-attenuating designs of eidd-2801 we found that the affinity-enhancing design formed 296 interactions but the affinity-attenuating design formed only 245 interactions in total table 1  proximal interactions polar contacts and hydrogen bonds were the major interactions that governed the increased or decreased affinity between eidd-2801-nsp12 a ligand interaction diagram between eidd-2801 and nsp12 for the affinity-enhancing and affinity-attenuating designs clearly shows that the absence of a higher number of hydrogen bonds with asn691 and arg682 formed between nsp12 and eidd-2801 contributed to the lower binding affinity fig s6  we further computed the normal modes of nsp12 of sars-cov-2 rdrp to understand which portions and sites of nsp12 undergo large amplitude movements comparisons of these modes to our remdesivir-binding site designs of nsp12 is crucial to understand the dynamics and flexibility of crucial nsp12 sites first our analysis of the displacement of each c atom for modes 7 to 12 revealed that residues 400-750 were mostly stable across all modes fig s7  second our calculation of the square of the fluctuation of each c atom calculated from the 200 lowest nontrivial modes and normalized highlighted that nsp12 residues from 400-800 exhibited fewer fluctuations compared to other sites fig 6a  finally our residue correlation analysis which represented the correlated movement of the c atom in the nsp12 protein showed that residues 450-780 of nsp12 undergo a highly correlated coupled motion fig 6b  all of these data suggest that nsp12 residues 450-780 are highly stable and do not exhibit much fluctuation these data correlated well with our design results which showed that the remdesivir-bound nsp12 designs exhibited lower rmsds and did not undergo large conformational changes even after mutations rna viruses have a remarkable ability to adapt to new hosts environments and drugs via the development of genetic variations in a short time 16  the rna viruses tended to mutate faster than dna viruses and single-strand viruses exhibit higher mutation rates than double-strand viruses mutation rates are not fixed and evolve in response to drug pressures there are many examples of virus mutations that alter virulence or cause drug resistance the resistance against the nucleoside analog azidothymidine azt is a classic example of the importance of viral mutation azt was the first approved drug for human immunodeficiency virus hiv treatment but hiv rapidly developed azt-resistance mutations that led to the failure of azt monotherapy sars-cov-2 has maintained a low mutation rate which is attributed to the 3to-5 exoribonuclease activity of the nsp14 protein which helps maintain its replication fidelity 17  the low mutation rate of sars-cov-2 suggests that it may evolve relatively slowly compared to other viruses but the comparative rates of evolution also depend on how many sites are targeted by selection however sars-cov-2 often fails to infect close contacts which suggests that there is an abundant scope to increase transmission ability in the future 18  the viral load in a patient is very high 100000 viral copies per ml of saliva which suggests that every possible mutation may develop over the course of the infection 19  the occurrence of extremely high viral loads may also account for the fast-spreading nature of the covid-19 pandemic rdrps catalyze the rna template-dependent formation of phosphodiester bonds and facilitate virus replication and transcription the nsp12 subunit of the rdrp of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share a high homology which suggests that its function and mechanism of action are well conserved 10 20  rdrps are the primary targets for antiviral drug development against sars-cov-2 and several rdrp-targeting drugs such as remdesivir favipiravir galidesivir ribavirin and penciclovir are in testing stages 21 22 23  remdesivir is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral drug that demonstrated activity against covs and other rna viruses it is being tested as a potential treatment for covid-19 in multisite clinical rdrp that led to drug-resistance were observed previously 22 25 26  since its emergence in november 2019 several mutations in the rdrp of sars-cov-2 were reported a total of 783 nsp12 mutations have been reported and are listed in the cov-glue database and 15 residues are in the remdesivir-binding site a recent study identified mutation hotspots in sars-cov-2 27  they showed that viral strains with rdrp mutation had a median of 3-point mutations and viral strains with no rdrp mutation had a median of 1 mutation a mutation in position 14408 of sars-cov-2 rdrp was associated with an increased mutation rate 27  two nsp12 mutations f480l and v557l conferred an up to 56-fold resistance to sars-cov 22  and these residues are conserved across all covs a detailed atomic-level understanding of rdrp interaction with remdesivir using robust molecular technologies could revolutionize the development of new therapies to fight covid-19 in a highly specific and efficient manner we designed 50000 remdesivirinteracting nsp12 residues using high-throughput ligand-based interface designing we also docked the oral nhc prodrug -d-n 4 -hydroxycytidine-5-isopropyl ester eidd-2801 which is similar to remdesivir because both drugs work by mimicking ribonucleosides into the remdesivir binding site of sars-cov-2 rdrp and designed 50000 eidd-2801-interacting nsp12 residues therefore a total of 100000 designs were made and analyzed in detail the most striking result was that even after designing 56 residues in remdesivir binding site of nsp12 and 65 residues in the eidd-2801 binding site of nsp12 the designs retained 96-98 sequence identity which suggests that sars-cov-2 attained resistance with very few mutations in nsp12 these highly mutation-prone residuessites should be critically considered in the development of future therapeutics and during analyses of pandemic evolution the affinity-attenuating designs showed lower remdesivir binding which indicates that the sars-cov-2 could develop remdesivir resistance via mutations at these residues these hotspot residues would likely undergo selective mutations in the future to establish remdesivir and related drug resistance our design methodology mutated and rank-ordered specific remdesivir-resistance mutations of sars-cov which highlights its accuracy and predicting ability the normal mode analysis and residue correlation analysis suggest that residues 400-750 are mostly stable across all modes and undergo a highly correlated coupled motion which suggests that this region does not exhibit much fluctuation these results correlate well with our design results in which remdesivir-bound nsp12 designs did not undergo large conformational changes and retained 96-98 sequence identity even after mutations modulated the binding affinities with remdesivir and eidd-2801 compared to the 21 nsp12 residues in the remdesivir-bound designs only 13 nsp12 residues varied in the eidd-2801bound designs this result suggests that eidd-2801 is more effective in preventing the emergence of resistance mutations due to the restricted mutational landscape and explains why eidd-2801 is effective against remdesivir-resistance mutations our cohesive and comprehensive work highlights the hotspot residues of nsp12 that have the potential to undergo mutation to develop remdesivir resistance information on potential mutants could help clinicians adjust drug regimens to administer treatments earlier and more aggressively in higher-risk conditions we acknowledge certain limitations in the current study our rosetta ligand-based interface design method and scoring function is set to design mutants with improved interface delta and therefore increased binding affinity to remdesivir however ideally the remdesivirresistance mutations are affinity-attenuating designs to the best of our knowledge at present neither rosetta nor any other programs have protocols to accurately score and predict affinityattenuating designs to correlate with a drug resistance mutation nonetheless rosetta methodology remains the only useful design-based tool for mutational mapping and prediction of specific residues involved in enhancing or attenuating protein-ligand interaction therefore to make sure that our rosetta protocol captures the correct affinity-attenuating designs to correlate with remdesivir-resistance mutations we carried out control experiments by taking the wild-type and a previously known remdesivir-resistance sars-cov mutation as control we argue that the affinity-attenuating designs representing the potential hotspot residues have a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop remdesivir and related drug-based resistance finally owing to a lack of the structure of the rdrp-eidd-2801 complex the exact structural information predicted from the docked complex of rdrp-eidd-2801 might not be precise however since remdesivir and eidd-2801 bind at the same position the error might not be significant enough to impact our design results we conclude that in the absence of detailed information on the evolutionary forces and the role of selection pressures predicting how a virus may evolve is a challenging task particularly during a nascent outbreak the rapid availability of more sars-cov-2 genomes most of which differ by one or few mutations is enabling accurate investigations into spread patterns genomic epidemiology-based analysis is being used to control the fast-growing sars-cov-2 outbreak our prediction on the mutation repertoires complements research to understand and manage drug resistance and pathogenesis and guides development strategies to deter future cross-species transmissions the cryo-em structure of the rna-dependent rna polymerase from sars cov-2 pdb id 7bv2 consists of an nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex bound to the template-primer rna and triphosphate form of rtp 11  these data were retrieved from the rcsb protein data bank and subsequently used to obtain the key interactions and contacts between nsp12 and remdesivir a total of 56 residues from nsp12 interacted with remdesivir eidd-2801 is an orally bioavailable nhc prodrug -d-n 4 -hydroxycytidine-5-isopropyl ester that is similar to remdesivir and both drugs work by mimicking ribonucleosides therefore eidd-2801 was docked into the remdesivir binding site of the rna-dependent rna polymerase of sars-cov-2 15 molecular docking was performed using the autodock tools to dock the eidd-2801 into the nsp12 binding cavity in which it exerts its antiviral action via the introduction of copying errors during viral rna replication 28 29  the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex included the rna and mg 2 catalytic ions pdb id 7bv2 is cocrystallized with the remdesivir the same binding grid was selected for the eidd-2801 docking studies the protein and ligands were prepared using the mgl tools hydrogens and kollman charges were added to the protein and hydrogen and gaisteger charges were added to eidd-2801 for preparation the grid was set as x42 y46 and z52 with 0375- grid spacing the protein and ligand were docked and 100 binding poses were generated for the analysis the best binding pose that laid well in the binding cavity and showed interactions with the key catalytic residues were selected for further analysis the interactions between the complex and ligands were identified a total of 65 residues from nsp12 interacted with eidd-2801 the crystal structure of remdesivir-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 and the eidd-2801-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 in complex with template-primer rna were first optimized using schrdinger maestro schrdinger release 2016-4 maestro schrdinger new york the parameters for remdesivir and eidd-2801 were not available a priori for rosetta-compatible forcefield therefore the appropriate charges were added and parameters for remdesivir and eidd-2801 were generated the resulting complexes with remdesivir and eidd-2801 were used for structural refinement by rosetta relax which is the main protocol for all-atom refinement of structures in the rosetta forcefield 30  ten models were generated for each design group in this step namely the remdesivir-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-template-primer rna and eidd-2801-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-template-primer rna the full atom-relaxed structures from each group with the lowest energy were used for subsequent ligand-based interface design experiments the catalytically critical mg 2 ions were retained in all of the refinement and subsequent design steps rosetta macromolecular modeling suite was used to perform the ligand-based interface design experiments 31  the nsp12 was redesigned with allowed backbone flexibility using rosettas full-atom scoring function in the remdesivir-and eidd-2801-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8template-primer rna-bound structures for the remdesivir-wrapped nsp12-nsp7-nsp8template-primer rna-bound structure 56 residues of nsp12 that are known to interact with remdesivir were designed with 19 other amino acids and 65 residues of nsp12 were designed to have intermolecular contacts with eidd-2801 for the eidd-2801-bound nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-template-primer rna-bound structure during these design experiments all of the other residues of nsp12 nsp7 and nsp8 were allowed to repack without design a total of 100000 designs comprised of remdesivir-and eidd-2801-bound complexes were generated a modified rosettascripts was used to design the interface residues of nsp12 in complex with remdesivir and eidd-2801 that considered small movement of the backbone of nsp12 to avoid steric clashes with ligands upon the introduction of mutations 32  the designs were sampled using monte-carlo simulated annealing in the rosetta all-atom force field for a comprehensive understanding of the structural and residue-specific changes of nsp12 upon interaction with remdesivir and eidd-2801 the rosetta total score root mean square deviation rmsd from the starting structure rosetta interface delta representing the binding affinity between the designed nsp12 with remdesivir and eidd-2801 and the percentage sequence identity from the starting sequence were obtained to test the accuracy and reliability of our ligand-based rosetta interface design protocol we considered a previously reported remdesivir-resistant mutant of sars cov v557l in which val557 is a remdesivir-interacting residue of nsp12 15  during this step the val557 residue was designed with the 19 other amino acids but the remaining nsp12 residues were allowed to repack without further design a total of 5000 designs were generated at 557 th position and analyzed to monitor the highly prevalent designed residues with their corresponding scores and rankings the type and frequency of designed amino acids in the 56 and 65 nsp12-interacting residues of remdesivir and eidd-2801 respectively from the top-ranked affinity-enhanced and affinityattenuated designs were obtained and plotted using weblogo which graphically represents the multiple sequence alignment of an amino acid profile 33  the residue index is shown in the x-axis of these plots and the sequence conservation of an amino acid at that position is shown in the y-axis the height of symbols within the stack in each plot indicates the relative frequency of a specific amino acid at that position the 100000 remdesivir-and eidd-2801-bound nsp12 structures generated using rosetta ligand-based interface designs were subjected to the calculation of the binding affinities using prodigy-li protein binding energy prediction -ligands which is a structure-based method for the prediction of binding affinity in protein-ligand complexes 34 35  a 3d model of the design with the bound ligand was supplied and the binding affinity was computed from the rosetta-designed structures the binding affinity g and the contact counts were obtained for analysis a detailed decomposition of intermolecular contacts was obtained for the top five affinity-enhancing and affinity-attenuating designs for the remdesivir-and eidd-2801-bound nsp12 structures the intermolecular interactions between top-ranked affinity-enhancing and affinity-attenuating remdesivir-nsp12 and eidd-2801-nsp12 designs were obtained using the arpeggio webserver 36  the total number of interactions obtained represents the sum of the number of van der waals proximal polar contacts hydrogen bonds aromatic contacts hydrophobic contacts and carbonyl interactions the 2d-ligand interaction diagrams showing the various types of intermolecular interactions between remdesivir-nsp12 and eidd-2801-nsp12 top-ranked affinity-enhancing and affinityattenuating designs were obtained

this report includes all patients with confirmed covid-19 hospitalized at riley hospital for children at indiana university health in indianapolis as of may 4 2020 testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in indiana began february 26 and the first confirmed case was march 6 3 critical illness was defined as requiring admission to the picu all covid-19 patients had an infectious disease consultation institutional treatment guidelines at the time considered hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir if available via compassionate use tocilizumab was available for patients with cytokine storm convalescent serum was available for some standardized laboratories were obtained oxygenation saturation index osi was calculated with the following formula 4 mean airway pressure  fio2  100  peripheral oxygen saturation data were abstracted from medical records after the study was deemed exempt from review by the institutional review board at indiana university statistical analyses included fisher exact test for categorical variables mann-whitney u test for continuous nonparametric variables and t test for continuous normally distributed variables p value of less than 005 was considered significant analysis was completed using statase 142 statacorp college station tx at the time of writing 24 out of 407 children tested positive for sars-cov-2 at our hospital nineteen pediatric covid-19 patients required hospitalization seven were critically ill with four requiring intubation fig 1 demographics comorbidities and presenting symptoms stratified by critical illness are presented table 1 comorbidities were present in two intubated patients one had cerebral palsy and restrictive lung disease and the other had an elevated body mass index and new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis as compared to other hospitalized patients with pediatric covid-19 those who developed critical illness had longer duration of symptoms p  0036 and significantly lower oxygen saturation on room air p  0016 on presentation the critically ill also had significantly more thrombocytopenia p  0015 and higher c-reactive protein crp p  0031 wbc was significantly lower in critically ill patients p  0039 although interquartile ranges iqrs were within normal range for both groups five patients had coinfections with other respiratory viruses including rhinovirusenterovirus n  2 human coronavirus nl63 n  1 respiratory syncytial virus n  1 and parainfluenza virus n  1 these included three critically ill 36 50 and two noncritical patients 29 22 p  033 all critically ill patients had abnormal chest radiograph findings compared with 56 of noncritical patients however there was no statistical significance of the critically ill three patients were treated with high flow nasal cannula and had an uneventful picu course four patients required intubation fig 1 with three intubated within 24 hours of presentation due to hypoxia the fourth presented in new-onset diabetic ketoacidosishyperosmolar hyperglycemia he initially tested negative for sars-cov-2 was intubated on hospital day 4 and tested positive for sars-cov-2 at that time duration of mechanical ventilation averaged 141 days all critically ill patients were initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics until diagnosis of covid-19 was confirmed cultures from blood and other specimens were obtained at admission to rule out bacterial infection as appropriate therapies including pharmacologic and supportive care are outlined in figure 1 remdesivir was considered for all mechanically ventilated patients two received it one patient did not qualify and the other was not given remdesivir due to acute kidney injury and mild rhabdomyolysis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemia these critically ill patients had complicated courses one patient treated with remdesivir developed transaminitis alanine transaminase 290 ul and aspartate transaminase 1271 ul and significant rhabdomyolysis creatine kinase 55360 ul with peak values the day after completing remdesivir two patients developed secondary bacterial infections one patient developed increased hypoxia and hypothermia after 14 days of ventilation respiratory culture demonstrated pseudomonas aeruginosa he was treated with cefepime and nebulized tobramycin another patient failed extubation after 8 days of ventilation respiratory culture demonstrated haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis he was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate one patient died after sudden cardiac arrest his crp and ferritin improved after receiving tocilizumab and convalescent sera however on day 6 of mechanical ventilation hospital day 11 he developed a nonperfusing junctional rhythm then ventricular tachycardia and was unable to be resuscitated cause of death remains unclear and a postmortem examination was not performed we describe characteristics critical care courses and comparisons among hospitalized pediatric covid-19 patients including seven with critical illness during the early weeks of the pandemic at a us childrens hospital these initial findings deserve further exploration in larger studies we noted severe covid-19 disease for some patients with a greater proportion of hospitalized children requiring mechanical ventilation 215 than has been reported to date these included patients without comorbidities we also experienced a pediatric death related to covid-19 at the time of diagnosis with sars-cov-2 critically ill patients had symptoms for a longer period of time and were significantly more hypoxic thrombocytopenic and inflamed per international reports mechanical ventilation for children with covid-19 is rare with only one in the coronavirus infection in pediatric emergency departments confidence study 1 two in lombardy italy 01 and 13 out of 2141 in china 57 us hospitals have reported lower proportions of intubated critically ill pediatric covid-19 patients and fewer ventilated days 8 9 thrombocytopenia was associated with critical illness and has been described as an early finding in patients with covid-19 10 thrombocytopenia is suspected to be multifactorial and could be due to cytokine storm or direct effects of sars-cov-2 on bone marrow host immunity or lung parenchyma 11 consistent with a chinese study crp was elevated in 10 of 13 children 12 and in our cohort higher crp was associated with critical illness wbc was lower in critically ill patients although the iqrs for both groups were within normal our center appears to have a greater proportion of pediatric cases requiring mechanical ventilation than is reported elsewhere 59 further research is needed to understand factors associated with critical illness and mechanical ventilation for pediatric covid-19 we note that the clinical and laboratory findings in critically ill children with covid-19 in this study decreased oxygen saturation thrombocytopenia and elevated crp are also seen in children with bacterial sepsis 13 14 thus the present study does not provide clinical findings or biomarkers that might distinguish critical covid-19 from sepsis typical management for these critical cases includes broad-spectrum antimicrobials while sars-cov-2 testing and bacterial cultures are pending the crp and osi of the four intubated patients improved with various therapies the most striking improvements were noted in patients 2 and 4 following tocilizumab convalescent sera and prone positioning the osi for patients 1 and 3 did improve after starting remdesivir although crp did not this difference of unclear clinical significance could be due to the tocilizumab targeting the il-6 receptor and causing mitigation of the cytokine cascade while remdesivir and convalescent plasma target sars-cov-2 with a small number of ventilated patients and three of four having received a combination of therapies it is challenging to investigate the role of any single therapy the death of patient 4 occurred unexpectedly his crp and ferritin improved after receiving tocilizumab and convalescent sera however his d-dimer gradually rose compared with the other three patients although there has been a concern for thrombotic events in patients with covid-19 this patient was on anticoagulation at the time with a therapeutic anti-xa of 05 international unitsml certain demographics appear to be associated with critical illness in pediatric covid-19 although there was one critically ill infant in our cohort older children appear more likely to have critical illness most patients in our report were male 737 and all critically ill patients were male a slight male predominance among children with covid-19 has been reported out of italy 57 confidence study the united states 5257 and china 566 69 15 by contrast eight of 10 infants with covid-19 were female in another chinese report 16 larger pediatric studies could better define whether risk of severe covid-19 in the united states is increased in male children limited data currently exist on racialethnic disparities among hospitalized pediatric covid-19 patients in this report 74 of hospitalized pediatric covid-19 patients and five of seven critically ill children 71 were african-american or hispanic indianas population is 851 caucasian 98 african-american and 71 hispanic 17 thus both moderate and severe covid-19 disproportionately affected african-american and hispanic children given the few significant comorbidities in our report disparities may point to greater risks for acquiring sars-cov-2 among african-american and hispanic children structural racism underlies wide health inequities in the united states 18 and must be addressed in the covid-19 pandemic including impacts of the pandemic on children of color limitations of this report include the small number of patients which limits the conclusions that may be drawn additionally some mild cases did not have laboratories completed due to a combination of an average 12-hour turnaround in sars-cov-2 testing and rapid clinical improvement leading to same-day discharges from the hospital we note however key observations that may inform other pediatric centers and should prompt investigation in larger studies although these data come from review of medical records an institutional algorithm and infectious disease consultation on each case supported consistent documentation severe protracted covid-19 disease is seen in pediatric patients including those without significant comorbidities older children african-american or hispanic children and males may be at risk for severe covid-19 requiring hospitalization hypoxia thrombocytopenia and elevated crp may be useful markers of critical illness larger studies are needed to examine associations with severe covid-19 in pediatrics data regarding optimal management and therapies for pediatric covid-19 are urgently needed we acknowledge the physicians nurses and staff caring for these and all patients with coronavirus disease 2019 as well as the families and communities coping with the severe impacts of this disease  sars-cov-2 an emerging coronavirus that causes a global threat jun zheng   since december 2019 an increasing number of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan a city with 11 million people have alarmed the local hospital on 29 december 4 cases were linked to huanan seafood wholesale market 9 where non-aquatic live animals including several kinds of wild animals were also on the sales the local center for disease control cdc then found additional patients linked to the same market after investigation and reported to china cdc on 30 dec 2019 9 the second day world health organization who was informed of the cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology by china cdc 10 on 6 jan 2020 a level 2 emergency response was launched by china cdc 11 the causal agent was not identified until 7 jan 2020 a new type of coronavirus was isolated by chinese authority 10 the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 wh-human1 was first released and shared by china on 10 jan 12 the isolation and identification of sars-cov-2 apparently facilitated the development of molecular diagnostic methods and the confirmation of the infected patients as of 21 jan there are 270 cases were confirmed from wuhan 13 on 23 jan wuhan city was locked down by local government on 30 jan who declared a public health emergency of international concern fig 1 subsequently the viruses were successfully isolated from several laboratories 81415 the virion of sars-cov-2 looks like a solar corona by transmission electron microscopy imaging the virus particle is in a spherical shape with some pleomorphism the diameter of the virus particles range from 60 to 140 nm with distinctive spikes about 8 to 12 nm in length 8 the observed morphology of sars-cov-2 is consistent with the typical characteristics of the coronaviridae family the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 from clinical samples has been obtained by several laboratories with deep sequencing 814-18 the viral genome of sars-cov-2 is around 298 kilobase with a gc content of 38 in total consisting of six major open reading frames orfs common to coronaviruses and a number of other accessory genes 1416 the sequences analysis showed that the genome sequences of viruses from different patients are very conserved 141519 implying that the human virus evolves recently a typical characteristic of the sars-cov-2 infected patient is pneumonia now termed as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 demonstrated by computer tomographic ct scan or chest x -ray 3818 in the early stages the patients showed the acute respiratory infection symptoms with some that quickly developed acute respiratory failure and other serious complications 20 the first three patients reported by the china novel coronavirus investigating and research team all developed severe pneumonia and two of these three patients with available clinical profiles showed a common feature of fever and cough 8 a subsequent investigation of a family of six patients in the university of hong kong-shenzhen hospital demonstrated that all of them had pulmonary infiltrates with a variety of other symptoms 18 the chest x-ray and ct imaging in a study showed that 75 of 99 patients demonstrated bilateral pneumonia and the remaining 25 unilateral pneumonia 21 overall 14 of the patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity 21 the first cases of coronavirus infection in the united states also showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs by chest radiography however the pneumonia for this patient was only detected on the day 10 of his illness 22 it is also of note that one of patients among the family of six patients did not present any other symptoms and signs but had ground-glass lung opacities identified by ct scan 18 at least four comprehensive studies on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 infected patients have been performed 2123-25 the most common signs and symptoms of patients are fever and cough 2123-25 fatigue was complained by 96 of patients n138 in one study 24 but was less outstanding 18 n44 in another report 23 a combinational analysis of the common recorded signs or symptoms of the reported cases found that fever was observed in around 90 of the sars-cov-2 infected patients the number of patients with cough is relatively less 68 compared to fever table 1 in addition shortness of breath or dyspnea muscle ache headache chest pain diarrhea haemoptysis sputum production rhinorrhoea nausea and vomiting sore throat confusion and anorexia were also observed in a proportion of the patients 2123-25 table 1 a common feature of patients of sars mers or covid-19 is the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome however the estimated fatality rate of covid-19 23 is much lower than sars 10 and mers 36 2627 furthermore the viruses responsible for above three diseases are evolutionary distinct see below for details 19 it is clear now that sars-cov-2 can be transmitted by human-to-human despite the majority of the early cases had contact history with the huanan seafood market 111828 analysis of 425 patients with confirmed covid-19 showed that the incubation period is 3 to 7 days the mean was 52 days 95 ci 41 to 70 and the 95th percentile of the distribution is 125 days 95 ci 92 to 18 11 notably it was reported that the incubation period could be as long as 24 days in a rare case 25 the basic reproductive number r0 up to the period of 4 jan 2020 was estimated based on the study of 425 patients to be 22 meaning that one patient has been spreading infection to 22 other people 11 slightly smaller than the value of 268 by a modelling in another 29 the r0 of sars-cov-2 from both of these two studies is smaller than that of sras which are 3 before public health measures were implemented 30 however subsequent investigation based on the analysis of high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data estimated that the r0 is much larger ranging from 47 to 66 before the control measures 31 implying that sars-cov-2 is highly contagious and more infectious than initially estimated this conclusion is consistent with the wide spread of sars-cov-2 within a short period time and was also echoed by the finding that sars-cov-2 spike s protein had 10- to 20-fold higher affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor than that of sars-cov based on the cryo-em structure analysis of s proteins 32 similar to sars-cov the entry of sars-cov-2 into host cells depends on the recognition and binding of s protein to ace2 receptor of the host cells 1433 the high affinity of s protein to ace2 receptor likely contributes to the quick spreading of virus the finding of ace2 as the receptor of sars-cov-2 also indicates that human organs with high ace2 expression level such as lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine are potentially the target of sars-cov-2 34 as a new coronavirus it is not known yet about how sars-cov-2 spreads current knowledge for sars-cov-2 transmission is largely based on what is known from the similar coronaviruses particularly sars-cov and mers-cov in which human-to-human transmission occurs through droplets contact and fomites sars-cov is predominantly transmitted through indirect or direct contact with mucous membranes in the mouth eyes or nose 35 it has been shown that unprotected eyes and exposed mucous membranes are vulnerable to sars-cov transmission 36 a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia was infected by sars-cov-2 after the inspection in wuhan 37 as he wore a n95 mask but not any eye protector and experienced eye redness before the onset of pneumonia it was thus suspected that unprotected exposure of the eyes to sars-cov-2 might be another transmission pathway 37 however sars-cov-2 was not detected from the conjunctival swab sample in a confirmed covid-19 patent with conjunctivitis 38 suggesting that more evidences are needed before concluding the conjunctival route as the transmission pathway of sars-cov-2 the mode of transmission by mers-cov is not well understood but is believed to spread largely via the respiratory close contact route 3940 based on the transmission mode of sars-cov and mers-cov a serial of preventive measures have been recommended including avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections and frequent hand-washing 41 the viruses of sars-cov-2 were also detected in the stool samples in some patients but not all 1822 suggesting that a possible fecal-oral transmission occurs 42 a systematic study showed that viruses could be detected in oral swabs anal swabs and blood samples of the patients and the anal swabs and blood could test positive when oral swab tested negative 43 furthermore a trend of shift from more oral positive in the collected samples during the early period of patient infection to more anal positive during later period of infection was also found 43 therefore a multiple shedding routes of sars-cov-2 might exist one of the challenges for preventive control of sars-cov-2 spreading is that the viruses are likely transmitted by asymptomatic contact a german businessman was found infected by sars-cov-2 after attending a conference together with a colleague who had no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill due to the sars-cov-2 infection later 44 this observation suggests that infected patients likely start to shed viruses before the onset of any symptom which undoubtedly will bring great challenge to the current practice of preventive control by measuring body temperature despite the claim of the transmission by asymptomatic contact has been challenged 45 other asymptomatic carriers were also observed to transmit the viruses of sars-cov-2 4647 consistently a study found that an asymptomatic patient had a similar vial loads in the samples of nasal and throat swabs to that of the symptomatic patients 48 it is critical to identify the origin native hosts and evolution pathway of the virus that causes an outbreak of a pandemic this information can help understand the molecular mechanism of its cross-species spread and implement a proper control measure to prevent it from further spreading the association of initially confirmed sars-cov-2 cases with huanan seafood market suggested that the marketplace has played a role in the early spreading 1123 however whether it is the origin of the outbreak and what is the native hosts of sars-cov-2 remain uncertain in fact the firstly documented patient was not linked to huanan seafood market 23 the analysis of sars-cov-2 origin was firstly performed based on the genome sequence of virus isolates from six patients 19 when compared with sars-cov and mers-cov the nucleotide sequences of sars-cov-2 showed a higher homology with that of sars-cov while was relatively poor with that of mers-cov 19 despite some of the six major ofrs of sars-cov-2 genes share less than 80 identity in nucleotide acids to sars-cov the seven conserved replicase domains in orf1ab has 946 sequence identity in amino acids between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 14 suggesting that these two viruses might belong to the same species the origin of sars-cov has been extensively investigated masked palm civets were initially considered to transmit sars-cov to humans as a close variant of sars-cov was detected from palm civets 49 this conclusion was supported by the fact that three of the four patients had the record of contact with palm civets during the two small-scale of sars outbreaks occurred in late 2003 and early 2004 50 51 however a deep investigation based on the genome sequence of isolated viruses showed that sars-cov-like virus in civet had not been circulating for long 52 subsequently coronaviruses with high similarity to the human sars-cov or civet sars-cov-like virus were isolated from horseshoe bats concluding the bats as the potential natural reservoir of sars-cov whereas masked palm civets are the intermediate host 53-56 it is thus reasonable to suspect that bat is the natural host of sars-cov-2 considering its similarity with sars-cov the phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 against a collection of coronavirus sequences from various sources found that sars-cov-2 belonged to the betacoronavirus genera and was closer to sars-like coronavirus in bat 19 by analyzing genome sequence of sars-cov-2 it was found that sars-cov-2 felled within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus and was closely related to two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 but were relatively distant from sars-cov 15 18 57-59 meanwhile zhou and colleagues showed that sars-cov-2 had 962 overall genome sequence identity throughout the genome to batcov ratg13 a bat coronavirus detected in rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province 14 furthermore the phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome the receptor binding protein spike s gene and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene respectively all demonstrated that ratg13 was the closest relative of the sars-cov-2 14 however despite sars-cov-2 showed high similarity to coronavirus from bat sars-cov-2 changed topological position within the subgenus sarbecovirus when different gene was used for phylogenetic analysis sars-cov-2 was closer to bat-sl-covzc45 in the s gene phylogeny but felled in a basal position within the subgenus sarbecovirus in the orf1b tree 57 this finding implies a possible recombination event in this group of viruses of note the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 demonstrates a similar structure to that of sars-cov by homology modelling but a few variations in the key residues exist at amino acid level 15 19 despite current evidences are pointing to the evolutional origin of sars-cov-2 from bat virus 1557 an intermediate host between bats and human might exist lu et al raised four reasons for such speculation 15 first most bat species in wuhan are hibernating in late december second no bats in huanan seafood market were sold or found third the sequence identity between sars-cov-2 and bat-sl-covzc45 or bat-sl-covzxc21 the closest relatives in their analyses is lower than 90 fourth there is an intermediate host for other human-infecting coronaviruses that origin from bat for example masked palm civet and dromedary camels are the intermediate hosts for sars-cov 49 and mers-cov respectively 60 a study of the relative synonymous codon usage rscu found that sars-cov-2 bat-sl-covzc45 and snakes had similar synonymous codon usage bias and speculated that snake might be the intermediate host 61 however no sars-cov-2 has been isolated from snake yet pangolin was later found to be a potential intermediate host for sars-cov-2 the analysis of samples from malytan pangolins obtained during anti-smuggling operations from guangdong and guangxi customs of china respectively found novel coronaviruses representing two sub-lineages related to sars-cov-2 62 the similarity of sars-cov-2 to these identified coronaviruses from pangolins is approximately 855 to 924 in genomes lower than that to the bat coronavirus ratg13 962 1462 however the receptor-binding domain of s protein from one sub-lineage of the pangolin coronaviruses shows 974 similarity in amino acid sequences to that of sars-cov-2 even higher than that to ratg13 892 62 interestingly the pangolin coronavirus and sars-cov-2 share identical amino acids at the five critical residues of rbd of s protein while ratg13 only possesses one 62 the discovery of coronavirus close to sars-cov-2 from pangolin suggests that pangolin is a potential intermediate host however the roles of bat and pangolin as respective natural reservoir and intermediate host still need further investigation as an emerging virus there is no effective drug or vaccine approved for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection yet currently supportive care is provided to the patients including oxygen therapy antibiotic treatment and antifungal treatment extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo etc 2122 to search for an antiviral drug effective in treating sars-cov-2 infection wang and colleagues evaluated seven drugs namely ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine remdesivir gs-5734 and favipiravir t-750 against the infection of sars-cov-2 on vero e6 cells in vitro
63 among these seven drugs chloroquine and remdesivir demonstrated the most powerful antiviral activities with low cytotoxicity the effective concentration ec50 for chloroquine and remdesivir were 077m and 113m respectively chloroquine functions at both viral entry and post-entry stages of the sars-cov-2 infection in vero e6 cells whereas remdesivir does at post-entry stage only chloroquine is a drug used for an autoimmune disease and malarial infection with potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities 6465 an ec90 690 m against the sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells is clinically achievable in vivo according to a previous clinical trial 66 remdesivir is a drug currently under the development for ebola virus infection and is effective to a broad range of viruses including sars-cov and mers-cov 6768 functioning as an adenosine analogue targeting rdrp remdesivir can result in premature termination during the virus transcription 6970 the ec90 of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells is 176 m which is achievable in vivo based on a trial in nonhuman primate experiment 6369 encouragingly in the first case of sars-cov-2 infection in the united states treatment with remdesivir was provided intravenously to the patient on the day 7 without any adverse events observed the patients clinical condition was improved on day 8 and the previous bilateral lower-lobe rales disappeared implying the remdesivir might be effective to the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 22 this result however should be interpreted with caution as this is only single case study and a proper trial control was lacking in addition baricitinib a janus kinase inhibitor was also predicted to reduce the ability of virus to infect lung cell by an analysis of benevolentai 71 currently chloroquine and remdesivir are under phase 3 clinical trial and open-label trial for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection respectively table 2 72 preliminary results showed that chloroquine phosphate had apparent efficacy in treatment of covid-19 73 however caution must be taken during clinical use of chloroquine as its overdose is highly fatal without known antidote 74 despite the lack of documented in vitro data supporting the antiviral efficacy on sars-cov-2 several antiviral chemotherapeutic agents have been registered for the clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 table 2 72 sars-cov-2 is an emerging pathogen without any effective drug available for treatment at the moment it spreads quickly and can result in death of the infected patients despite the current mortality rate is 23 26 the emergence of large number of infected patients within short period of time could result in the collapse of health care system and thus the mortality rate might be elevated effective preventive measures must be implemented to control it from global spreading in addition great effort should be made on the development of vaccine and antiviral drugs meanwhile the intermediate host and the molecular mechanism of its cross-species spread should be further investigated legislation should be employed to prohibit the trade of wild animals the potential intermediate hosts of various viruses

azhar f e hui i d yuen s amp k  y  the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 necessitates strategies to identify prophylactic and therapeutic drug candidates for rapid clinical deployment a high-throughput high-content imaging assay of human hela cells expressing the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 was used to screen reframe a best-in-class drug repurposing library from nearly 12000 compounds we identified 66 compounds capable of selectively inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication in human cells twenty-four of these drugs show additive activity in combination with the rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and may afford increased in vivo efficacy we also identified synergistic interaction of the nucleoside analog riboprine and a folate antagonist 10deazaaminopterin with remdesivir overall seven clinically approved drugs halofantrine amiodarone nelfinavir simeprevir manidipine ozanimod osimertinib and 19 compounds in other stages of development may have the potential to be repurposed as sars-cov-2 oral therapeutics based on their potency pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles  patients with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov remain unvalidated for the newly emerged sars-cov-2 3  remdesivir a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity that works as an rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor has been reported to be effective against mers-cov and sars-cov-1 infections in animal models 4 5 6  repositioning of remdesivir as a treatment against sars-cov-2 infection has recently demonstrated positive clinical endpoints in a phase 3 adaptive covid-19 treatment trial median time to recovery shortened from 15 to 11 days 7 that justified emergency use authorization of remdesivir by the us food  drug administration for treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients 8  the effectiveness of the repurposed drug remdesivir with the current formulation requiring administration by iv infusion both highlights the importance of investigating pre-existing drugs to combat sars-cov-2 infections and the need for discovery of new or supplemental therapies that result in greater clinical improvements and can be administered outside of a hospital setting ie orally the reframe repurposing focused rescue and accelerated medchem drug collection is an extensive drug repurposing library containing nearly 12000 small-molecule drugs shown to be appropriate for direct use in humans 9 and provides a rich resource to discover new treatments that may be used as additional monotherapies or even in combination with remdesivir to further enhance efficacy and reduce drug resistance potential to identify compounds that could inhibit entry or replication of sars-cov-2 in human cells we developed a high-content imaging hci 384-well format assay using hela cells expressing the human sars-cov-2 receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ace2 hela-ace2 in this assay hela-ace2 cells are infected with sars-cov-2 virus in the presence of compounds of interest and viral infection is quantified 24 hours later fig 1a  the assay relies on immunofluorescent detection of sars-cov-2 proteins with sera purified from patients exposed to the virus which together with host cell nuclear staining allows for quantification of the percent infected cells in each well fig 1b  we validated the assay using compounds with reported activity against ebola and suspected or previously verified activity against sars-cov-2 remdesivir gs-5734 10 ec 50  194  20 nm average  sem of 5 independent experiments and the pikfyve inhibitor apilimod ec 50  50  11 nm average  sem of 4 independent experiments fig 1b  remdesivir at elevated concentrations was able to eliminate infected cells almost completely fig 1c  and we used it at a concentration of 25 m as a positive control with data normalized to it and neutral dmso control wells while apilimod was more potent than remdesivir it had a fractionally lower maximal efficacy 85-90 of uninfected cells at the highest effective concentrations compared to remdesivir additionally we assessed compound toxicity in the context of infection by quantifying the total cell numbers per well with cytotoxic protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin as a positive control average ec 50  547  27 nm average  sem of 5 independent experiments hela-ace2 cc 50  245  023 m average  sem of 5 independent experiments notably a concomitant increase in cell numbers coincided with the antiviral activity of remdesivir and apilimod likely due to reduction in proliferation of infected cells fig 1b-e  altering the multiplicity of infection had modest effects on the potency of control compounds in the same experiment with a 27-fold increase in remdesivirs ec 50 from moi1 to moi26 and a 37-fold increase in apilimods ec 50  but not that of puromycin fig s1  using the developed assay we ran a pilot screen to assess the activity of 148 small molecules with suspected therapeutic potential against coronavirus infections mined from the available literature 11 rz  084 we identified 19 compounds with an ec 50  96 m and based on data obtained from an uninfected hela-ace2 24-hour livedead assay 10 of these were selective uninfected hela-ace2 cc 50 sars-cov-2 ec 50  10 or uninfected hela-ace2 cc 50  40 m table s1  this included libraryscreening lots of apilimod ec 50  184 nm cc 50  40 m and remdesivir ec 50  300 nm cc 50  40 m that were rediscovered in the assay the higher ec 50 of apilimod and remdesivir are likely due to slight degradation over time in the screening deck compared to freshly prepared control powder stock screening reframe a best-in-class drug repurposing library next we screened the 12000-compound reframe repurposing library at a final concentration of 19 m and 96 m assay quality was maintained throughout both screens rz of 087 and 072 respectively table 1  and a clear distinction was apparent in the activity profiles of dmso vehicle-neutral control remdesivir-positive control apilimod- and puromycin-toxicity control-treated wells fig 1d 1e  hits were selected based on demonstration of 50 reduction in the number of infected cells per well -50 activity normalized to neutral controls minus inhibitors and 40 toxicity based on the total cell number per well -40 activity normalized to compound activities including 10 m puromycin fig 1e 1f  identifying 61 primary hits at 19 m and 266 primary hits at 96 m screening concentrations hit rates of 051 and 224 respectively with a total of 311 hits the hit rate for the primary screen of the reframe library was high 275 but not unexpected for this collection of bioactive small molecules many of which are approved drugs or in clinical phases of development and used for a wide assortment of indications  fig 2a  to reconfirm and assess potency and selectivity of the primary hits we tested 310 of the available compounds in a 10point 13 dilution dose response format with a top concentration of 96 m of these 225 726 demonstrated activity with ec 50  96 m against sars-cov-2 however many of the primary screen hits were also cytotoxic with an unacceptably low selectivity ratio as determined in uninfected hela-ace2 cells uninfected cc 50 ec 50  10  table 2  fig 2b  because viruses rely on host machinery for replication it was not unexpected that many of the compounds with antiviral activity also affected vital host processes interestingly this toxicity was sometimes masked in infected cells as reduction of viral infection by compounds like the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin and even hydroxychloroquine provided a benefit to cell health in the context of infection but not in uninfected cells fig 2c  table  s1  between the small pilot and the reframe screen and not including remdesivir we identified 67 66 unique as two different lots of gw-803430 were identified potent ec 50  96 m and selective cc 50 ec 50 10 or cc 50  398 m compounds  fig 2b  d table s1  the top four classes of potent and selective compounds were oncolytic compounds ion channel modulators anti-psychotics and receptor binding compounds fig 2d  a fifth of potent and selective hits could be classified as oncolytic drugs further reflecting the reliance of the virus on host cell processes present in rapidly proliferating cells the identification of compounds belonging to anti-psychotic cardiovascular and even anti-parasitic neglected tropical diseases classes may reflect the cationic amphiphilic nature of some of these molecules and their ability to accumulate in and impact acidic intracellular compartments eg late endosomeslysosomes resultant dysregulation of the endo-lysosomal pathway and lipid homeostasis has been suggested to impair viral entry andor replication 12 and this mode of action has been speculated for amiodarone and hydroxychloroquine both identified here as potent and selective hits against sars-cov-2 in our screen  table 2 table s1  we also identified two selective estrogen receptor modulators bazedoxifene ec 50  347 m and raloxifene ec 50  413 m a class of compounds previously found to inhibit ebola virus infection 13  out of the identified hits of highest interest were the newly identified approved oral drugs halofantrine hcl amiodarone nelfinavir mesylate simperevir manidipine ozanimod andosimertinib due to their relatively high exposures or a long history of use as therapeutic agents and therefore potential to be quickly repurposed as covid-19 treatments following further efficacy vetting in animal models the viral protease inhibitors nelfinavir and simeprevir have good exposures and based on their described mode of action we speculate that they inhibit sars-cov-2 directly the selective sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p1 receptor modulator ozanimod is also intriguing as a potential covid-19 therapy selective s1p1 agonists have been shown to provide significant protection against influenza virus infection in murine models by reducing inflammation at the site of infection reducing release of cytokines by pulmonary endothelial cells and infiltration of lymphocytes into the lungs 14  and thus ozanimod may serve as a good combination partner for a direct-acting antiviral drug the approved calcium-channel blocker manidipine has low exposure but may have the potential to improve covid-19 disease outcomes for patients interestingly amiodarone has previously been identified as having broad-spectrum antiviral activity in an in vitro screen 15  nineteen other compounds in various stages of development such as apilimod assay control that may inhibit viral entry through disruption of endolysosomal trafficking as found for filoviruses 16  the protease inhibitors nco 700 cathepsin b and dutacatib cathepsin k which may also impact viral entry all have the potential to show efficacy due to their potency or pharmacokinetic profiles  table 2  most of these except for the very potent apilimod had modest ec 50 s  1 m that did not surpass the potency of remdesivir however remdesivirs requirement for intravenous administration and potentially limited efficacy warrants further investigation into alternative or supplemental therapies therefore we investigated whether the hits identified in our screen would be suitable as partners for a combination therapy with remdesivir combination therapies have the potential to increase efficacy of treatment while reducing drug dose of either or both combinations partners and thus prevent side effects that may be associated with administration of higher doses drug combinations can also slow the acquisition of drug resistance drug synergy the increase in activity of the combination therapy beyond what is expected of an additive interaction is rare yet additive effects themselves have the potential to improve therapy regimens conversely antagonism the inhibition of activity of the overall combination beyond what would be expected if the compounds acted independently is an undesirable property to identify synergistic additive and antagonistic interactions between remdesivir and reframe hits we performed synergy interactions studies in a checkerboard experiment comparing full dose response of remdesivir against the dose responses of 24 hits with attractive safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in a 10  10 matrix fig 2e  we used the synergyfinder package 17 in r to assess the interactions between the tested compounds using the zero interaction potency model zip 18  where a  score  10 indicates likely synergy   -10 indicates antagonism and  between -10 and 10 suggests an additive interaction we found no genuine synergy between remdesivir and the compounds tested however the combinations were additive including that of nelfinavir with remdesivir fig 3a  table 1 table s1  suggesting these drugs if they were to prove efficacious in vivo could potentially be co-administered with remdesivir to increase the overall safety and efficacy of treatment while limiting the evolution of drug resistance to identify compounds that interact synergistically with remdesivir we carried out a second unbiased reframe screen in the presence of low concentrations 80 nm of remdesivir the activity of novel hits from this screen were assessed in the presence and absence of remdesivir based on a perceived shift in activity in the presence of remdesivir compounds were tested in a checkerboard synergy matrix and we identified the nucleoside analog riboprine n6-isopentenyladenosine previously investigated as an antineoplastic agent for treatment of nausea and surgical site infections and a component of citranatal 90 dha a prescription prenatalpostnatal multivitaminmineral tablet and a folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin an antineoplastic compound currently in phase ii stage of development as having activities that synergized with those of remdesivir the synergistic effects for both compounds were observed across specific concentrations signified as peaks within the 3dimensional synergy score landscape  figure 3b 3c  prompting closer scrutiny of activity of each compound riboprine achieved maximal 100 efficacy over the range of concentrations tested but addition of ec 2 of remdesivir shifted its ec 50 from 12 m to 36 m and addition of ec 24 of remdesivir increased its potency further to ec 50  16 m  figure 3b  10-deazaaminopterin showed only 40 maximal efficacy over the range of concentrations tested but the addition of ec 2 of remdesivir caused an increase of maximal efficacy from 40 to nearly 65 where a shift of 2 would be expected and addition of ec 24 of remdesivir increased maximal efficacy of the combination from 40 to 80  figure 3c  the mechanism of action behind the observed synergies remains to be determined riboprine has been reported to block uridine and cytidine import 19 and through inhibition of protein prenylation to inhibit autophagy 20 which could impact rna catabolism 21 whereas 10-deazaaminopterin has been suggested to inhibit folate dependent enzymes of the purine biosynthesis pathway 19 20 21 22  therefore treatment with either riboprine or 10-deazaminopterin may result in reduced intracellular nucleoside pools and in this way synergize with rdrp inhibition by the adenosine nucleoside analog remdesivir however another or more direct and specific interaction cannot be excluded and remains to be elucidated while these findings indicate a promising avenue for further investigation of combination therapies for treatment of covid-19 the adverse effects of these agents eg inhibition of immunity by 10-deazaaminopterin would need to be carefully considered in the design and dose selection of in vivo validation experiments in summary by screening the high-value repurposing reframe library we identified 75 unique known drugs or preclinical molecules with activity against sars-cov-2 in human cells 24 of which were tested and showed an additive interaction in combination with the antiviral compound remdesivir recently granted emergency approval for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection we also identified a synergistic interaction between remdesivir and both 10-deazaaminopterin and riboprine our data support the advancement of the identified compounds for further profiling in in vivo models to assess

polymerase from sars-cov-2 mechanism of reaction and inhibition by remdesivir juan aranda modesto orozco  we combine sequence analysis molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanicsmolecular mechanics simulations to obtain the first description of the mechanism of reaction of sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and of the inhibition of the enzyme by remdesivir despite its evolutionary youth the enzyme is highly optimized to have good fidelity in nucleotide incorporation and a good catalytic efficiency our simulations strongly suggest that remdesivir triphosphate the active form of drug is incorporated into the nascent rna replacing atp leading to a duplex rna which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one we did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of remdesivir at the active site displacement of the nascent remdesivir-containing rna duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition however after the incorporation of three more nucleotides we found a hydrated serine which is placed in a perfect arrangement to react through a pinners reaction with the nitrile group of remdesivir kinetic barriers for crosslinking and polymerization are similar suggesting a competition between polymerization and inhibition analysis of sars-cov-2 mutational landscape and structural analysis of polymerases across different species support the proposed mechanism and suggest that virus has not explored yet resistance to remdesivir inhibition  sars-cov-2 covid19 emerged in china in december 2019 and rapidly spread over the world causing a world-wide health threat at the beginning of june 2020 covid19 pandemic has caused around 400000 fatalities and at least 6 million people have been infected producing an unprecedent stress to the health-care systems 1 from a phylogenetic point of view sars-cov-2 belongs to the bgenus of the coronavirus family which includes other highly infective pathogens such as the middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov or the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov 2 sars-cov-2 has a large 30 kb of positive rna genome which forces it to a high fidelity in replication and accordingly to a relatively low mutational rate 3 4 a high-fidelity rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and a proof-reading exonuclease 5 are the crucial elements for maintaining the stability of the viral genome rdrp is the core of the replication machinery of the virus and the largest protein in the viral genome 932 residues it binds to nsp7 and nsp8 to form an active complex 6 that using as template the sense rna generates a negative copy which in a second cycle is used to generate new copies of genomic and sub-genomic rnas at least two other proteins are involved in the replication process a 601-residue helicase and a 527-residue proof-reading exonuclease 7 a simple blast 8 query shows that sars-cov-2 rdrp is highly conserved within the coronavirus family but no homologs are found out of it this would suggest that we are in front of a quite new protein which in principle did not have enough evolutionary time to optimize its function unfortunately the extremely high infectivity of the virus suggests that despite its youth rdrp is very effective how the enzyme achieves a good specificity and an excellent catalytic power is still unclear generating an important gap in our knowledge on sars-cov-2 replicative cycle due to its central role in the viral infective cycle rna polymerases are a major target for fighting rna-viruses 6 9 as today the only fda-approved drug for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 10 is a rdrp inhibitor remdesivir r a c-nucleoside see supplementary fig 1  which was in clinical trials for the treatment of ebola 11 a negative single strand rna virus very distant from sars-cov-2 but whose replication is also dependent on the action of a rdrp the mechanism of inhibition of rdrp by remdesivir is mostly unknown and conflicting hypothesis have emerged the last months this lack of knowledge dramatically hampers our ability to develop new and more active derivatives we present here a comprehensive theoretical study on the mechanism of action of sars-cov-2 rdrp md simulations show that despite its youth the enzyme has a discriminant active site which should guarantee high replication fidelity md and qmmm simulations demonstrate that the enzyme follows a canonical 2-ions reaction mechanism with a catalytic efficiency similar to that of the highly evolved eukaryotic polymerases the same type of calculations demonstrates that remdesivir triphosphate rtp the expected bioactive form of remdesivir can be recognized and incorporated into a nascent rna with an efficiency only slightly lower than natural nucleotides ie r is not an inhibitor of nucleotide incorporation extended md simulations failed to detect any dramatically distortion in the rna duplex due to the presence of remdesivir which would justify inhibitory properties furthermore no steric clashes were detected when the nascent rna duplex was displaced along the exit channel see below which argue against the hypothesis that steric clashes could explain a delayed inhibition however the same analysis suggests that when three more nucleotides are incorporated to the rna after remdesivir the c1 nitrile group of remdesivir reaches the proximity to ser861 favoring an unexpected crosslinking reaction activation barriers of polymerization and crosslinking are comparable raising an interesting scenario of competition between polymerization and inhibition which can explain the unique inhibitory properties of remdesivir in summary our results provide then not only the first atomistic description of the mechanism of action or sars-cov-2 rna polymerase but also a plausible explanation for the inhibitory mechanism of remdesivir rdrp complex set-up the cryo-em structure of the rdrp nsp12 of sars-cov-2 complexed to nsp8 and nsp7 12 cofactors was used as our starting model we aligned it with the rdrp from hepatitis-c virus x-ray structure 13 from which rna the two catalytic metal ions and the diphosphate group of an ntp analogue were extracted see supplementary methods for details during the preparation of this manuscript a cryo-em structure of rdrp in complex with a full rna strand appeared 14  confirming the accuracy of our model see supplementary  fig 2  afterwards we built a utp or rtp molecule inside the active site in the expected orientation required for incorporation into the nascent rna strand the system was solvated and neutralized prior to optimization thermalization t298k and equilibration see supplementary methods for details the final equilibrated structure was the starting point for further md simulations the progression of the polymerization process was simulated by adding additional base pair steps to the rna duplex moving the rru pair from i1 to i4 position keeping constant the reactive alignments at the i-position see supplementary fig 3  these structures allowed us to trace the sliding of the nascent rna duplex along the exit path and check for potential reasons for the r-induced delayed termination of the polymerization reaction md simulations on rdrp classical trajectories were used to refine and check the stability of complexes prior to running qmmm simulations as well as to determine the impact of rincorporation in rna minimization thermalization and equilibration were performed using standard procedures as described in supplementary methods production simulations were carried out using the amber 18 program 15 and state-of-the art conditions for a total time of at least 05 s water molecules were described through the tip3p 16 model parameters of magnesium ions were taken from allner et al 17 carlson et al 18 parameters were used for triphosphate groups parmbsc0-chiol3 for rna 19 20 21 22 and ff14sb 23 for the proteins parameters and charges of utp rtp remdesivir nucleotide and 3 terminal u and r were derived to be compatible with the force fields making use of the red server 24 additional details of the simulation setups can be found in supplementary methods qmmm systems two families of systems were generated to explore enzyme reactivity the first was created to follow nucleotide incorporation while the second was intended to study a potential crosslinking between ser861 and the nitrile group of rna-incorporated remdesivir qm subsystems used in reactivity calculations are shown in supplementary fig 4  the qm part was described at the b3lyp6-31g level of theory using the link-atom to join qm and mm regions 15 the hybrid qmmm models were built using randomly selected snapshots obtained in the last ns of unrestrained md simulations which were then minimized and re-equilibrated at the b3lyp6-31gmm level of theory a spherical droplet was extracted to compute twodimensional b3lyp6-31gmm potential energy surfaces pes in both forward and reverse directions selected reaction coordinates for the phosphoryl transfer are shown in fig 2 b and those for the crosslink of ser861 with remdesivir are shown fig 3 b see also supplementary  fig 4 and supplementary methods the amber program interfaced with terachem 19 25 26 was used for the qmmm calculations electrostatic embedding was used in all hybrid calculations qmmm-md simulations were performed to obtain minimum free energy paths mfeps by means of the string method 27 28 this method allowed us to explore different reaction mechanisms and select the preferred one in terms of free energy from 60 to 120 string nodes were used afterwards a path collective variable cv 28 was defined to obtain the potential of mean force pmf using from 60 to 120 umbrella sampling 29 windows the chosen set of cvs that followed the progress of the reactions the breaking and forming bonds are shown in fig  2 md simulations on nascent rna we performed md simulations on two duplexes rcgcgaauugcgcrgcgcaauucgcg and rcgcgaruugcgcrgcgcaauucgcg to determine the structural impact of the introduction of a remdesivir in a canonical rna duplex starting structures were those expected for a canonical rna duplex as implemented in amber systems were hydrated minimized thermalized and equilibrated using standard protocols 3334 before 1 s long md trajectories at constant temperature t298k and pressure p1 atm details of simulations are shown in supplementary methods mutations affecting rdrp were reconstructed using the augur pipeline to infer nucleotide changes at the internal nodes 35 applied to 12397 gisaid samples obtained on 30052020 the consequence type of the rdrp mutations was annotated using a customized implementation of the ensembl variant effect predictor vep version 92 using the first sars-cov-2 sequenced genome ncbi id nc045512v2 as a reference afterwards mutations were mapped on the md-refined structure of the rdrp-rna complex to locate their proximity to crucial functional regions the aggressiveness of each individual mutation was evaluated from blosum80 matrices 36 homolog search were performed with blastp 8 as implemented in the ncbi web server httpsblastncbinlmnihgov alignments were performed using emboss program 37 as implemented in the ebi webserver httpswwwebiacuktoolspsa sars-cov-2 rdrp active site suggests good fidelity and activity the viral protein see fig 1 a has a quite canonical active site similar to those of other polymerases two essential mg 2 coordinate the b and g phosphate groups of the incoming triphosphate nucleotide as well as asp618 asp760 tyr609 and the o3 terminal of the negative rna strand see fig 1 b  which according to the circular reaction mechanism for polymerases by de vivo and coworkers is expected to be ionized 38 two arginine residues arg624 and arg553 coordinate the phosphates of the incoming nucleotide aligning the gamma phosphate for an effective transfer see fig 1  c  the affinity for ribonucleotides triphosphate substrates can be explained by the need for north puckering otherwise reactive groups are not well aligned as well as by a myriad of specific h-bonds between the 2oh group of the ntp and the catalytic site asp623 and ser683 side chains see fig 1 c  additional hydrogen bonds are found between i1 2oh and ser759 see fig 1 d  the base-specificity is controlled by the complementarity of hydrogen bonding with the template nucleobase see fig 1 e supplementary fig 5  by the phosphate coordination as well as by the residues surrounding the active site that embrace the pairs introducing strong isosteric requirements that make very unlikely a non-watson-crick pairing scheme see fig 1 e  overall the active site emerging from em structures 12 14 39 40 and atomistic simulation strongly suggest that despite the reduced evolutionary refinement sars-cov-2 rdrp has all the structural requirements to be an efficient rna polymerase both in terms of catalysis and substrate specificity the rna-pol reaction mechanism qmmm simulations were used see methods and supplementary methods to study the ability of sars-cov-2 rdrp to incorporate a natural triphosphate ntp exemplified here by utp as well as rtp remdesivir-tp into a nascent rna careful analysis of trajectories and of the free energy profiles shows that the calculation is well converged leading to a smooth free energy profile with a single maximum transition state ts a free energy of activation of 158 kcalmol -1 for utp see fig 2 supplementary fig 6 and supplementary video 1 and a negative free energy of reaction around 5 kcalmol prior to ppi release very interestingly kinetic parameters for rdrp compare well to those associated to prokaryotic or eukaryotic polymerases 41 42 43 which combined with the similarity in the reaction mechanism allow us to conclude that the enzyme can be quite novel in evolutionary terms but it is as efficient as the highly evolved eukaryotic polymerases trajectories show that rtp fits very well into the active site showing strong canonical watson crick interactions with the uridine in the template rna its isosterism with adenosine allows a perfect shape complementarity at the binding site showing an arrangement of reactive groups that predicts that it will be a substrate rather than an inhibitor this hypothesis is confirmed by accurate qmmm simulation that show that incorporation of rtp can happen with a free energy barrier only slightly larger than that of a natural substrate 10 up to 174 kcalmol -1  see fig 2  supplementary fig 7 and supplementary video 2 such an increase is due mostly to a slight misalignment of the oa-pa-o3 attack angle 161  8 for rtp and 172  5 for utp see also supplementary fig 6-8  thus in agreement with recent em experiments 14 we can rule out the possibility of remdesivir inhibiting rdrp by blocking the atp-binding site of rna polymerase on the contrary our simulation strongly suggests that rtp can be efficiently incorporated in front of uridine in a nascent rna strand free energy profiles for the incorporation of a u or a r to a nascent viral rna strand the reaction consists on a nucleophilic attack of the o3 of terminal nucleotide to the pa of the triphosphate nucleotide b schemes representing the transition states found for utp or rtp substrates distances included in the definition of the reaction coordinate s are shown c active site insight of the ts found when utp is the substrate for the elongation reaction the phosphoryl group is halfway to be transferred mg1 activates the o3 towards the nucleophilic attack and stabilizes the negatively charged ts mg2 stabilizes the charged ts and the newborn negatively charged ppi molecule distances involved in the reaction are shown as dotted lines with its average value in  d active site insight of the ts found when rtp is incorporated shown as ball and sticks with its c atoms shown in purple remdesivir is a c-nucleoside that may produce distortions in the helix which might result in a delayed inhibition of the enzyme due to incorrect displacement of the nascent duplex along the exit channel to explore this possibility we performed md simulations of two rna duplexes differing only in the substitution of a central rau pair by rru one see methods results summarized in fig 3 strongly suggest that remdesivir is well tolerated in an rna duplex and does not introduce any major structural distortion which could justify termination of rna synthesis particularly there are not significant differences between the hydrogen bonding stability of rau and rru pairs see remdesivir can crosslink rna and rdrp trying to explore alternative reasons for the inhibitory properties of remdesivir we slide the nascent rna duplex along the exit tunnel of rdrp to make the rru pair by simulating addition of extra nucleotides this allows us to scan interactions of the rna at several positions along the exit tunnel after r was incorporated we were not able to detect any point of steric clash that could justify stopping the polymerase progression see supplementary fig 9  interestingly when three more nucleotides were incorporated we found a ser861 whose side chain locates at around 3703  from the nitrile group of remdesivir see supplementary fig 10 a b  the distance does not justify however a steric clash considering the large flexibility of the ser sidechain especially in a well-solvated microenvironment see supplementary fig 10 a  arguing against the hypothesis that nitrile-ser861 steric clash can explain the inhibitory properties of remdesivir 10 however a close look to the trajectories shows that the ser861 side chain is frequently pointing towards the nitrile group of remdesivir in an arrangement suitable for a nucleophilic attack and in the presence of water that spontaneously enters into the cavity see supplementary fig 10 c d  in summary it is placed in an optimal position as to act as a general acidbase catalyst note that while not suggested for this protein attacks of serine and cysteine to nitrile groups have been characterized for other proteins 44 45 which drives us to explore in more detail this potential reaction mechanism by using a qmmm strategy similar to that used to describe the polymerization reaction see methods results see fig 4  qmmm pes in supplementary fig  11  and supplementary videos 3 and 4 show a concerted reaction mechanism where while hydroxylic group of ser861 attacks the carbon atom of the nitrile group a water molecule see supplementary fig 10 d abstracts one proton from the hydroxyl group of ser861 donating it to the n atom of nitrile group see fig 4 d supplementary video 3  the structures sampled along the minimum free energy profile agree with the electronic flow for a pinner reaction 46 our calculations suggest an exergonic -107 kcalmol -1  see fig 4 a process showing a single ts as expected from a concerted mechanism see figure 4 and supplementary fig 11  with an activation barrier of 147 kcalmol -1  see fig 3 a which compare with the activation barrier of polymerization of a utp 158 kcalmol -1  and rtp 174 kcalmol -1  qmmm calculations suggest the existence of a kinetic competition between utp incorporation and crosslinking leading to enzyme inhibition in principle barrier for utp incorporation is slightly larger than that of crosslinking which suggests that the rna will be kinetically trapped stopping the extension of the rna and inhibiting then the activity of the enzyme however we can expect residual polymerization leading to longer transcripts as experimentally observed 9 a larger concentration of remdesivir might favor the inhibition by a double mechanism by increasing the probability of rtp incorporation into nascent rna and also by enlarging the gap in relative activation free energy between polymerization and crosslinking from 11 kcalmol -1 to 27 kcalmol -1  and driving then the kinetic balance towards the inhibition side the proposed covalent inhibition mechanism is consistent with the incorporation of three more nucleotides after incorporation of remdesivir to rna 9 and agrees with a myriad of indirect evidences other than the delay inhibitory properties of remdesivir for example mutational analysis shows that ser861 has a crucial role in r-induced inhibition of rdrp 40 furthermore large and systematic efforts to substitute the nitrile group by less problematic substituents the nitrile group appears as a probably undesired consequence of the remdesivir synthetic pathway resulted in molecules with a lower inhibitory profile 47 finally pinner reaction has not been described for rdrp but has been experimentally validated for many several nitrile-containing drugs designed to inhibit cysteine or serine proteases 48 49 altogether results strongly suggest that remdesivir inhibits sars-cov-2 by a covalent mechanism  thousands of sars-cov-2 viruses have been sequenced showing that rdrp accumulates a non-negligible number of mutations which lead to viable virus ie to active rdrp we should then check whether some of these mutations invalidate our reaction mechanism as shown in supplementary fig 12  this is not the case missense variant leading to amino-acid changes are typically mild according to blosum80 matrices and are located in loops on the surface of the protein  supplementary fig 12 a  particularly the active site and the exit tunnel are very well conserved during the viral evolution see supplementary fig 12 b c  moreover virus has not explored yet mutational landscape in the region of the ser861 see supplementary fig 12 d  remdesivir is not likely to affect human rna polymerases remdesivir enters in human cells and is transformed into rtp also by human enzymes considering the similarity in the mechanism of reaction of sars-cov-2 rdrp and human polymerases we could expect remdesivir being incorporated into rna which could rise to inhibition of the human enzyme with toxic consequences to check this possibility we explored the extension of the nascent rna along the exit channel to trace close interactions between the nitrile group and serine or cysteine residues in the two crystallized human rna polymerases rna polymerase 50 and human rna polymerase ii 51  we did not find any of these residues in the expected displacement path of remdesivir once incorporated into the nascent rna see supplementary  fig 13  in other words no significant inhibition of the human polymerases is expected note that this explains the reduced toxicity of remdesivir in humans 52 53 inhibition mechanism can be common to other viruses ser861 is highly conserved in other covs rdrps see supplementary fig 14  placing a constant position in an alpha helix that adopts a highly conserved 3d arrangement compare sars-cov-2 and sars-cov structures 12 14 39 40 54 and this position is well preserved in those cases for which cov rdrps structure is available this would suggest that remdesivir might be effective against many other cov rdrps the mechanism of inhibition of other distant rna-viruses marburg virus ebola hepatitis c and many others might be similar but needs to be elucidated it is tempting to believe that enzymes evolved to discriminate between dna 2deoxyribose and rna ribose might be decorated with a large number of serine tyrosine or threonine in the exit channel suggesting a general delay inhibitory mechanism like that suggested here note that this would agree with the delayed inhibition of ebola rdrp by remdesivir 55 the lack of structural information and the poor sequence similarity between the rdrps precludes to confirm this hypothesis sars-cov-2 rdrp is a protein common to other coronaviruses but showing little homology out of the family as covs are just a few thousand years old the protein has had a limited evolutionary period and we could expect low efficiency however our calculations show that it has a well refined reaction site able to select the entering nucleotide and to catalyze its addition to a nascent rna the viral enzyme follows a mechanism that is similar to that of bacterial or eukaryotic polymerases with the transferred phosphate being stabilized by 2 mg 2 ions exquisitely coordinated by acidic residues of the catalytic site while the phosphates of the incoming nucleotide being stabilized by a network of basic residues our simulations very clearly suggest that rtp is not inhibiting the active site by competing with atp at the catalytic site but that it is incorporated into the nascent rna in front of a uridine the resulting duplex does not show dramatic structural changes which would hinder displacement of the nascent duplex along the exit channel in fact analysis of the displacement of the rna-containing remdesivir along the exit tunnel fail to detect points of steric clashes but show the spontaneous formation of a catalytical arrangement that justifies a pinner reaction between the nitrile group of remdesivir and ser681 leading to the formation of a protein-rna covalent bond however we cannot determine whether this inhibition will be reversible or not as inspection of the free energy curve fig 4d  and the behavior of similar inhibitors 49 for other proteins suggest that it may display slow reversibility 49 56 this potential reversibility combined with the kinetic competition between crosslinking and polymerization might explain the unusual inhibitory properties of remdesivir results presented here open then the possibility to design better inhibitors of covs rdrps and to a rethinking on the use of covalent inhibitors of pathological proteins  investigation of some antiviral n-heterocycles as covid 19 drug molecular docking and dft calculations mohamed hagar hoda ahmed a ghadah aljohani omaima alhaddad a   novel coronavirus covid-19 emerged as an infection and quickly spread to all countries and is primarily transmitted by contact with infected droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when infected people cough or sneeze the first identification of human coronaviruses was observed in the mid-1960s 12 coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviridae which is a family of enveloped- single stranded- positive sense rna virus in addition to the family of coronaviridae was divided into four genera    and  coronaviruses of  and  genera generally infect mammals and humans while the type of  and  genera mainly infect birds that specification is according to the phylogenetic analysis and genome structure of coronaviruses 3 covid-19 is a novel coronavirus of the  genus it is round in shape or crown-shaped and has a diameter of  60140 nm as per observations under the electron microscopy 3 the incubation period of covid-19 ranges from 2 to 14 days according to the world health organization there have been around 1 million and 550 thousand reported cases of covid-19 disease and more than 90000 reported deaths to date 11042020 moreover sars-cov-2 the big family of covid-19 is sensitive to heat and ultraviolet uv rays furthermore they are inactivated at 56 c for half hour and can be stored at 80 c for many years additionally 75 ethanol chlorine containing disinfectants and peracetic acid can effectively inactivate covid-19 4 in general the major principle to prevent and control the infectious disease is eliminating the source of infections thereby protecting the very sensitive population 5 the hydroxychloroquine an approved drug for malaria disease by fda was explored as a medication for sars-cov-2 67 previous reports revealed that the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the coronavirus covid-19 by changing the ph at the surface of the cell membrane this action can inhibit the attachment of the virus to the cell membrane in addition it can prevent nucleic acid replication glycosylation of viral proteins virus assembly new virus particle delivery virus release and other mechanisms to obtain its antiviral effects 8 remdesivir ebolas medication 9 demonstrated activity against the coronavirus family in 2017 and 2020 1011 to date there are no sars-cov-2 vaccines available however several domestic and foreign research institutions and enterprises have used several methods including mrna nano-vaccine technology recombinant or inactivated vaccine technology and dna vaccine technology to develop coronavirus vaccine 5 the treatment of this virus has not been achieved by any available antiviral agent hence our present work suggests that selection of some derivatives with the appropriate viral restraining mechanisms can offer promising results although the development in the biomedical research has widespread area over the past two decades the yearly number of new treatments agreed by the us food and drug administration fda has remained relatively limited 12 compared to de novo drugs and randomized clinical studies the drug repurposing for virus including the novel coronavirus is represented as an impacted drug discovery strategy from existing drugs and could essentially shorten the time and reduce the cost 131415161718 recently chinese medicinal plants were classified as antiviral inhibitors of the novel covid 19 1920 the anti-coronavirus effects of these natural derivatives have been confirmed in vitro by direct loading onto cultured cells however it does not guarantee their effectiveness in vivo some protease inhibitors may have an antiviral effect by blocking coronavirus main protease this assumption was supported by fda approval about the use of ritonavirlopinavir based on data obtained from in vitro studies 21 so a recent comparative investigation was established to rationalize the potential use of protease inhibitors as a treatment against infections of sars-cov-2 22 computational aspects offer new testable hypotheses for regular drugs involved for novel coronavirus 1323 recently a virtual screening technique was carried out to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of many natural compounds through the molecular docking and cell-based assays 24 recently our research group has focused on the determination of the molecular geometry of synthesized materials via relating the desired properties from experimental evaluation with the estimated parameters from computational calculations 252627 heterocycles are widely investigated for possible medicinal applications 25262829 favipiravir 1 30 amodiaquine 2 31 2-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine 3 32 and ribavirin 4 33 are known as antiviral drugs they inhibit various rna and dna viruses hence we aim to determine whether the protease of covid-19 can be a target protein of these nucleotides in silico using molecular docking moreover a comparative study between these drugs with the fda approved remdesivir and hydrocloroquine antiviral drugs against a broad range of rna viruses 11 has been established to investigate the effectiveness of the drugs as inhibitors for covid 19 frontier molecular orbitals fmos are the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo the homo is the highest energy orbital occupied with electrons so it is an electron donor while lumo is the lowest energy orbital that has a space to accept electrons so it is an electron acceptor these orbitals control the mode of the interaction of the drugs with other molecules such as the interactions between these drugs and their receptors the frontier molecular orbitals fmo can give realistic qualitative information about susceptibility of the electrons of the homo to transfer to the lumo moreover homo and lumo are very important quantum chemical parameters to determine the reactivity of the molecules and are used to calculate many important parameters such as the chemical reactivity descriptors the energies of the homos and lumos of the studied compounds were calculated using dft method at b3lyp 6311g dp basis set and are tabulated in table 2 the isodensity surface plots of homo and lumo for investigated compounds are shown in figure 2 the results of the fmos energy analysis revealed that the energies of homos of drugs 1 and 4 are lower compared with the other compounds 2 and 3 however the destabilization of the lumo level is found to be higher in 1 than the others consequently the energy gap of studied drugs is in the order of 1  2 3  4 recently many reports showed that the fmos have to be taken into consideration in investigation of the structure activity relationships 343536 the fmos theory showed that the energy level of the homo and the lumo are the most significant aspects that impact the bioactivities of small structural drugs mainly homos that offer electrons however the lumos accept electrons obviously the level of energy of homos are different for all investigated drugs compound 2 showed the most lying homo than the other drugs and consequently it could be a better electron donor drug interestingly drug 4 of the largest energy gap e  554 ev there are several hydrophilic interactions that could facilitate the binding with the receptors this suggests that such hydrophilic interactions considerably impact the binding affinity of such small drugs to the receptors the homo of a certain drug and the lumo with the adjacent residues could share the orbital interactions during the binding process the ehomo and elumo are indicators for the prediction of the ionization potential i ehomo and the electron affinity a-elumo of molecules besides the frontier molecular orbitals are used in estimation of other chemical reactivity descriptors such as electronegativity  global hardness  softness  and electrophilicity  these are calculated according to the following equations 37112ehomoelumo

422 the  value is a prediction of the power of the molecule to attract electrons ie lewis acid while small values of  are indication of a good base the global hardness  is a degree of their charge transfer prohibition however the global softness  characterizes the ability of a molecule to accept electrons 37 soft molecules are of a small energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals and are more reactive than the harder because they could easily transfer electrons to the acceptors the electrophilicity  calculated from the electronegativity and chemical hardness is an indicator of lower energy difference due to the highest electron movement between the acceptor lumo and the donor homo to validate the evidence about the reactivity of the drug as inhibitors the molecular electrostatic potential mep is important to be calculated although the mep gives an indication about the molecular size and shape of the positive negative as well as the neutral electrostatic potential these could be a tool to predict physicochemical property relationships with the molecular structure of the drugs under investigation moreover the molecular electrostatic potential is a useful tool to estimate the reactivity of the drugs toward electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks the molecular electrostatic potential of the studied drugs 14 is calculated by the same method under the same base sets and seen in figure 3 in the mep the maximum negative region is the preferred sites for electrophilic attack indicated as red color so an attacking electrophile will be attracted by the negatively charged sites and the opposite satiation for the blue regions it is obvious that the molecular size and the shape as well as the orientation of the negative positive and the neutral electrostatic potential varied according to the drug because of the type of the atoms and its electronic nature the difference in the mapping of the electrostatic potential around the drug could be principally responsible for variation of its binding affinity with the active sites receptor the mulliken atomic charges of the estimated drugs 14 were calculated the dft using b3lyp 6 as a method at 311g dp at a basis set the data were tabulated in table 3 it showed that the c7 is the most positive and o10 have the most negative charge for drug 1 on the other hand it is observed that the most nucleophilic centers of drug 2 are n11 and n31 which are the most electrophilic susceptibility positions on the other hand it is obvious that the nucleophilic susceptibility of the drug 2 is recognized on c22 and c27 sites however n4 and n3 are the most negative charges of drugs 3 and 4 and their respective positively charged atoms are c5 and c15 the positively charged centers are the most susceptible sites for nucleophilic attacks ie electron donation however the most negatively charged centers are the most susceptible sites for electrophilic one docking simulation studies were done to predict the binding mode of drugs 14 at the sars-cov-2 mpro pocket similarly the hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir were docked in the protein pocket as a control the binding affinity of compounds 14 ranged between 406 to 777 kcalmol as presented in table 4 however the superpositions of the resulted poses of ligands 14 with the docking models of hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir clearly showed that ligand 1 violet stick is not located in the catalytic dyad of the receptor figure 4 while ligands 24 are located in the active pocket similar to hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir moreover ligand 3 green stick did not demonstrate any significant interaction with the cys-his catalytic dyad although it was oriented toward his-41 figure 5 strikingly ligand 4 is predicted to bind to the catalytic dyad cys-145 and his-41 with strong hydrogen bonds along with other residues with binding energy 469 kcalmol the 2d representation of the binding mode of the ligand 4 in the receptor was predicted a high efficiency of the inhibitor with respect to the remdesivir as illustrated in figure 5 interestingly ligand 2 with the least binding energy 777 kcalmol might be better inhibitor to sars-cov-2 mpro comparable with the hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir with binding affinity 606 and 496 kcalmol respectively ligand 2 is interacted with the receptor with different hydrophobic interactions besides three hydrogen bonds with amino acids leu141 cys145 and gln189 in a distance 207 291 and 239  figure 6 the molecular docking results revealed that the effective interactions of proteins with the drug 2 were found on the atoms n11 n31 and o29 and this could be attributed to the presence of lone pair electrons on these atoms moreover the - stacking could be another hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the receptors as previously discussed from the dft calculations the electrostatic potential gives an idea about the molecular size and shape of the positive negative as well as the neutral electrostatic potential to estimate the reactivity of the studied drugs toward electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks moreover van der waals surface will provide some more negative electrostatic force found on n11 0729 n31 0742 rather than o29 0612 for drug 2 however the negative electrostatic potential is localized on n1 0336 n3 0713 rather than o7 0490 for drug 4 these negative mep charges could be used for h-bond formation or van der walls interactions with protein receptors it is obvious that the negative electrostatic potential of drug 2 is higher than that of the drug 4 and this could be an illustration of the least binding affinity of 2 compared with other ligands 1 3 and 4 on the other hand dft calculations of the frontier molecular orbitals to make a comparison between the energy level of homo and lumo as well as with their energy gap of the investigated drugs showed their impact on the bioactivity of these compounds the energy levels of homos are between 565 ev to 761 ev however the lumo are in between 105 to 547 ev depending on the conjugation as well as the nature of substituents around the nucleus further the order of the fmos energy gap was 214 400 528 and 554 for 1 2 3 and 4 respectively it is clear that the drug 2 of the high lying homo is the most susceptible to be electron donor moreover drugs 2 and 4 are considered good electrophiles because of their high electrophilicity indices 1369 and 1280 respectively moreover drug 2 of a high basicity   370 rather than the others could be another effect on the binding affinity 1138 another factor that could affect the degree of the interaction of these drugs with the protein is the dipole moment 394041 the calculated dipole moments of the investigated drugs are in the range of 1444226 debye in the order of 2  4  1  3
table 1 all these factors could share together with different extent to significantly impact the degree of the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites the theoretical estimations were carried out for the investigated drugs by gaussian 09 software 2009 gaussian 09 revision a 02 gaussian inc wallingford ct usa 42 b3lyp 6311g basis set was nominated for the dft calculations the structural geometry was optimized by minimizing its energies compared to all geometrical variables without forcing any molecular symmetry restrictions the molecular structure of the optimized drugs has been drawn by gauss view 43 the calculated frequency showed that all molecular structures of the investigated drugs was stationary points in the geometry optimization method without the presence of an imaginary frequency docking studies were carried out using the autodock 42 program 44 the crystal structure of covid-19 main protease at 216  resolution was retrieved from the protein data bank pdb 6lu7 httpswwwrcsborgstructure6lu7 the 3d structures in pdb format of hydroxychloroquine db01611 and remdesivir db14761 were obtained from the drugbank data base the selected drugs 14 were extracted from the pubchem database in the sdf format and were converted to pdb format using pymol the pymol molecular graphics system v16-alpha schrodinger llc new york ny usa 2013 before docking compounds 14 on the target the protein was edited using autodocktools adt the water molecules were removed the polar hydrogen atoms were added to the amino acid residues and gasteiger charges were assigned to all atoms of the protein then the protein in pdbqt format was used as an input for the autogrid program autogrid performed a pre-calculated atomic affinity grid maps for each atom type in the ligand plus an electrostatics map and a separate desolvation map present in the substrate molecule taking the entire protein as the search space flexible ligand docking was performed for each compound docking calculations were carried out using the lamarckian genetic algorithm lga and all parameters were the same for each docking this process was repeated 100 times for each ligand and the final mean affinity score was taken the results were shown using discovery studio visualizer v172016349 44 four known antiviral drugs favipiravir 1 amodiaquine 2 2-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine 3 and ribavirin 4 have been investigated as inhibitors for covid-19 by dft and molecular docking calculations the results of the docking studies aimed at studying the binding mode of these drugs to the sars-cov 3clpro the results revealed that amodiaquine 2 and ribavirin 4 showed the best affinity with the target receptor even though this behavior was not experimentally verified it was predicted that the amodiaquine showed the lowest binding energy 777 kcalmol with respect to the other drugs moreover amodiaquine binding affinity is lower than that of the approved medicines hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir which have binding affinity 606 and 496 kcalmol respectively the results of the molecular docking have been illustrated in terms of the dft calculations the dft results showed that amodiaquine 2 is the most lying homo and consequently it could be the best to act as an electron donor moreover the most electrophilic centers of the drug 2 are n11 n31 and o29 and this could be attributed to the presence of the lone pair of electrons on these atoms further the - stacking could be another hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the receptors additionally a high basicity   370 and dipole moment   144 debye of drug 2 rather than the others could be the other factors that enhanced the extent of the binding affinity it could be concluded that these parameters share together with different magnitudes and affect the degree of the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites to afford a certain degree of inhibition finally from these in silico studies for drug 2 it is very promising to perform further in vitro and small animal model in vivo studies to establish a solid experimental evidence of its activity as inhibitors for covid-19  overview of therapeutic drug research for covid-19 in china heng li li yang fei-fei liu xin-na ma pei-lan he wei tang xian-kun tong jian-ping zuo   in december 2019 a new type of unexplained pneumonia appeared in the south china seafood wholesale market in wuhan hubei province but its source has not yet been found to confirm the cause whole-genome sequencing of samples from patients with this unexplained pneumonia revealed a beta-coronavirus that had never been seen before which was different from sars-cov and mers-cov 1 after the alert of this new pathogen china quickly took measures to completely block off hubei province and implemented a quarantine policy nationwide to keep the outbreak under control this efficient process was also recognized by the international who this highly contagious new coronavirus was initially named 2019-ncov on feb 11 2020 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses introduced the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 to refer to the virus and the who named the related pneumonia coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 this article will go through basic virology of sars-cov-2 and review mainly the drugs used in the battle against covid-19 in china by genome sequencing it was found that sars-cov-2 has 82 sequence similarity with sars-cov 2 3 and through phylogenetic tree analysis it has 96 homology with bat coronaviruses at the genome level for which reason bats were inferred to be the host for sars-cov-2 4 the genome structure of sars-cov-2 is shown in fig 1 sars-cov-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus and is classified in the order nidovirales coronaviridae and coronavirus 5 coronaviruses are a large class of viruses that can infect mammals and birds and can cause many diseases such as respiratory intestinal liver and nervous system diseases 6 coronaviruses are divided into four groups alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-coronaviruses 7 and all known human pathogenic coronaviruses are beta-coronaviruses the single-stranded rna genome of sars-cov-2 is 29891 nucleotides in size the genes of sars-cov-2 from 5 to 3 are a 5 untranslated region including 5 leader sequences and open reading frame orf 1ab structural proteins including the envelope glycoprotein spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleoprotein n accessory proteins such as orf3 6 7a 7b 8 and 9b and a 3 untranslated region 3 orf1ab occupy two-thirds of the viral genome and they encode two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab 8 these two polyproteins can be hydrolyzed into 16 nonstructural proteins nsps including papain-like protease plpro 3c-like protease 3clpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase and exonuclease 6 the enveloped glycoprotein spike s forms a layer of glycoproteins protruding from the envelope and is closely related to virus infection of cells 9 there are multiple sequence segments in the receptor-binding domain of the s protein which have high homology with sars-cov sequences and some studies have confirmed that sars-cov-2 can bind to the ace2 receptor on the cell surface similar to sars-cov 1 3 10 two additional transmembrane glycoproteins envelope e and membrane m are incorporated into the virion nucleoprotein encapsulates the viral  rna genome in the form of a spiral in the envelope to prevent degradation accessory proteins do not participate in viral replication but they interfere with the host innate immune response or have other unknown functions 10 the sars-cov-2 possible life cycle begins when the spike glycoprotein on the envelope binds to the ace2 receptor and membrane fusion occurs either directly with the host cell membrane or with the endosome membrane after membrane fusion the viral rna genome is released into the cytoplasm and the uncoated rna is translated into two polyproteins the polyproteins are cleaved by the protease encoded by orf1a into the 16 nsps which can form an rna replicase-transcriptase complex 6 10 this complex drives the production of negative-sense rna which is used as a template for the full-length  rna genome during transcription subgenomic rnas are produced by discontinuous transcription and then transcribed into subgenomic  mrna which is translated into different structural proteins the newly formed structural protein and viral genomic rna combine to form a nucleocapsid the viral particles bud into the ergolgi intermediate compartment ergic and then the primary virion is released from the infected cells 10  a diagram of  sars-cov-2 life cycle is shown in fig 2 due to the sudden emergence of sars-cov-2 no specific antiviral agents are available however many drugs under development are believed to have potential anti-sars-cov-2 activity due to common biological processes in the virus life cycle currently there are 200 domestic clinical trials of covid-19 drugs from the chinese clinical trial registry chictr as of 10 march and most are for chemical drugs chinese patent medicines and combinations all of these clinical trials were registered in 2020 after the outbreak of covid-19 11 among those covid-19 treatment-related clinical trials a total of 155 registered covid-19 treatment drug-related interventional studies were obtained from the chictr database wwwchictrorgcn with ethics committee approval and informed consent signed by 10 march statistic information of these registered trials are shown in fig 3 the study phase of each trial was extracted and nearly 25 of these clinical trials were registered as phase 4 studies which were stated as postmarketing drugs or phase iv clinical trials by the chictr definition in phase four studies many domestically approved chinese patent drugs and chemical agents are being used to treat covid-19 patients with so many clinical trials registered in such a short period of time we can see that china has responded to the epidemic in a timely manner and hopes to find sars-cov-2-specific medicines to end the epidemic as soon as possible this urgent need propelled chinas drug research ability to its full power and this motivation involved many academic institutions hospitals and companies this approach has also led to concerns about this phenomenon excessive research and drug trials can create the problem of squeezing each other for limited medical resources or even wasting them this phenomenon and its impact on our medical system as well as possible improvement in our medical administration need thorough review and discussion at an appropriate time in the future in these 155 pooled clinical trials a number of approved chemical and biomacromolecule drugs have been used in covid-19 treatment clinical trials for drug repurposing most of which are nucleotide analogs and protease inhibitors against other viral pathogens including influenza virus hiv and hcv comprehensive information about the chemical agents used in covid-19 drug clinical trials is shown in the table below table 1 type i interferons including ifn- and ifn- have broad-spectrum antiviral effects 16 ifn- can directly inhibit virus replication or can achieve antiviral effects by activating innate or adaptive immunity 17 many studies have proven that ifn- has an antiviral effect on sars-cov 18 and other experts discovered that ifn- can prevent mers-cov infection and effectively inhibit the virus in the early stages of infection 19 because it is also a coronavirus and highly homologous to sars-cov ifn- is recommended for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection according to the latest new diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia ifn- at a dose of 5 million u or equivalent dose each time for adults is added to 2 ml of sterile water and it is aerosolized and inhaled twice a day 13 lopinavir was first approved in the united states in 2000 for the treatment of hiv infection 20 it is a protease inhibitor and is usually used in combination with ritonavir to increase its half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome p450 21 in vitro studies have shown that lopinavirritonavir can inhibit the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov and exert antiviral effects 2225 at present the drug has been used in the clinical treatment of covid-19 at a dose of 400 mg100 mg for adults twice daily and the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days 13 however this treatment has certain toxic and side effects on the treatment of covid-19 therefore its safety and effectiveness require further research recently some clinical studies have shown that lopinavirritonavir treatment has no significant effect 26 27 ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analog with a broad-spectrum antiviral effect 28 it is used mainly to treat respiratory syncytial virus infection 29 and in combination with interferon for hepatitis c 30 ribavirin was widely used in 2003 to treat sars-cov infection but when used alone it seemed to have no effect and caused significant hemolysis in many patients 3134 when ribavirin was combined with ifn- it had good antiviral activity in in vitro studies 35 some studies have shown that in patients with severe mers-cov infection ribavirin combined with ifn--2a treatment can significantly improve patient 14-day survival 36 preliminary in vitro test results demonstrate that ribavirin can inhibit sars-cov-2 in a human cell line in the latest diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia it is recommended to use ribavirin at a dose of 500 mg each time for adults and in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir with 23 intravenous infusions daily the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days 13 chloroquine phosphate is an antimalarial drug that has been on the market for many years and it also has a potential broad-spectrum antiviral effect 37 38 it can increase the ph of lysosomes to prevent virus fusion with the cell membrane and then block virus entry and infection 39 some studies have found that the spike glycoprotein on the virus envelope binds to the ace2 receptor to mediate sars-cov-2 infection 9 40 chloroquine phosphate has been reported to interfere with the glycosylation of the ace2 receptor thereby inhibiting the binding of sars-cov to cells and achieving therapeutic goals 41 therefore chloroquine phosphate is used to treat covid-19 and in vitro experiments show that chloroquine phosphate does inhibit sars-cov-2 and that its ec50 is 113 m 39 apart from the above antiviral mechanism chloroquine phosphate can continue to exert antiviral effects after sars-cov-2 invades cells and it also has immunomodulatory activity to strengthen the antiviral effect 42 therefore chloroquine phosphate has been included in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia and is undergoing clinical trials chloroquine phosphate is used for the treatment of covid-19 in adults aged 1865 years those who weigh more than 50 kg will receive 500 mg twice daily for 7 days while those who weigh less than 50 kg will receive 500 mg twice daily on days 1 and 2 and 500 mg once daily on days 37 13 arbidol is a non-nucleoside broad-spectrum antiviral drug for upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza a and b viruses and it was first approved in russia 43 it can inhibit the adhesion of viruses to host cells and prevent them from invading human cells 44 at the same time it can promote the synthesis of interferon which can prevent influenza virus invasion and treat influenza virus infection 45 some studies have confirmed that arbidol has a good effect against sars-cov and mers-cov infections 46 47 chinese scientists found in in vitro cell experiments that compared with a drug-untreated control group 1030 m arbidol can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 up to 60 times and significantly inhibit the pathological effects of the virus on cells 48 as described in the latest diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia arbidol is used at a dose of 200 mg for adults three times daily and the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days 13 it has been reported that some patients have improved symptoms after receiving arbidol 49 favipiravir is a nucleoside analog 50 51 with an ability to inhibit rna-dependent polymerase 52 and was approved for marketing in japan in 2014 it is used for antiviral treatment of influenza a and b 52 and can effectively inhibit ebola virus yellow fever virus 53 etc in vitro experiments have shown that favipiravir is effective for covid-19 and that its ec50 is 6188 m 39 to date some clinical trials of favipiravir in the treatment of covid-19 have been carried out in china recent clinical studies have found that compared with the antiviral drug arbidol the clinical effect of favipiravir is more significant nucleic acid positive-to-negative time mean antipyretic time and cough remission time were all better than those of the arbidol group 27 remdesivir was first used to treat ebola virus and it has completed phase 2 clinical trials 54 as a nucleoside analog it can interact with rdrp 55 56 and the triphosphate form of remdesivir will compete with adenosine triphosphate leading to delayed chain termination and inhibiting viral replication and transcription 57 a number of in vitro studies have shown that remdesivir has inhibitory effects on a variety of human and animal coronaviruses 58 59 an in vivo study of remdesivir against sars-cov showed that remdesivir can reduce virus levels in the lungs of mice infected with sars-cov and reduce lung function damage caused by the virus 60 moreover some studies have found that the antiviral effect of remdesivir against mers-cov is better than that of lopinavirritonavir combined with ifn- 21 according to the above evidence remdesivir has been used to treat sars-cov-2 and in vitro experiments showed that remdesivir has a good inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 077 m 39 recently the first covid-19 patient in the united states was treated with remdesivir on the 7th day of hospitalization and their clinical symptoms were improved significantly 61 at present a phase three clinical trial of remdesivir for covid-19 has been officially launched in china and a total of 761 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study which will be randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled 62 as a derivative of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine has similar efficacy and few adverse reactions based on its characteristics of immunomodulation antithrombotic activity and improved inflammation hydroxychloroquine has been used in the clinical treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus 63 hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 64 and it is clinically safer than chloroquine 65 66 some clinical studies have found that after treatment with hydroxychloroquine the viral load significantly decreases or even disappears and azithromycin can enhance the antiviral effect 67 68 chinese patent medicine is herbal medicines in traditional chinese medicine modernized into a ready-to-use form such as tablets oral solutions or dry suspensions chinese patent medicine has played very important roles in the domestic battle against covid-19 in china and many clinical investigations have started to more precisely evaluate its effects on covid-19 patient treatment chinese patent medicine as well as many herbal medicines has been very useful in improving symptoms such as coughing weakness and digestive system disorders as well as alleviating anxiety reports announced that up to 90 of covid-19 patients in china have been given chinese patent medicine or tcm prescriptions a list of chinese patent medicine currently undergoing covid-19 clinical trials is shown below table 4 to present an overall message about chinese patent medicine in covid-19 treatment research table 2 some studies have confirmed that sars-cov-2 infects cells through endocytosis via the ace2 receptor on at2 alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs 78 79 at present the protein structure of the s protein and ace2 interaction has been solved providing reliable guidance for vaccine and drug design 80 aiming at the mutual use of the s protein and ace2 protein necessary for sars-cov-2 to enter host cells multiple domestic research teams have discovered a variety of potential ace2-binding agents through molecular docking virtual screening methods and artificial intelligence drug screening methods plpro is a multifunctional protein with protease and phosphatase activity that is involved in viral replication and ifn antagonism 81 plpro of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have only 83 sequence similarity 82 however the high-level structure of the protein that forms the active site is not altered in the two plpro proteins 83 there are already domestic teams working to find potential inhibitors of plpro through virtual screening which needs to be confirmed by experiments the 3clpro of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have an amino acid sequence similarity of up to 96 and the structure of 3clpro in sars-cov-2 has been solved 82 3clpro is a key protein of the virus and the virus needs to use it to replicate rna therefore finding sars-cov-2 3clpro inhibitors can provide a more effective way to fight covid-19 as an rna virus sars-cov-2-encoded rdrp plays a key role in the viruss rna replication rdrp inhibitors can be used as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against rna viruses the rdrp protein structure has a large and deep groove structural region as the active center of rna synthesis the sequence similarity of the rdrp proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is as high as 96 and structural differences exist outside the active center 82 therefore high sequence conservation allows the development of rdrp inhibitors against sars-cov to be applied to the development of anti-sars-cov-2 drugs a recent study showed that in addition to the use of the sars-cov receptor ace2 to enter the cell sars-cov-2 has two other proteins cathepsin b and lcatbl and tmprss2 that activate the s protein help sars-cov enter the cell and play a key role in the process of invasion of normal cells by sars-cov-2 84 when a tmprss2 inhibitor is used in combination with a catbl inhibitor they can completely inhibit the invasion of sars-cov-2 therefore tmprss2 may be a potential antiviral target this article provides an overview of published information on domestic research and the development of coronavirus-related therapeutic agents the drug-repurposing effort summarized in this article focused primarily on agents currently known to be active against other rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov influenza hcv and ebola as well as anti-inflammatory drugs this information provides a strong intellectual groundwork for support of current and future research and development for the discovery and development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of covid-19 and coronavirus-related diseases however there are still no officially approved specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for sars-cov-2 and supportive care remains a key to treatment tcm has accumulated thousands of years of experience in the treatment of pandemic and endemic diseases complementary and alternative treatments are still urgently needed for the management of patients with sars-cov-2 infection and experiences in tcm are certainly worth examining many antiviral chinese patent medicines such as shuanghuanglian oral solution and others have been declared to have the effect of heat clearing and detoxifying which could help clear viral respiratory pathogens and relieve symptoms according to tcm theory chinese patent medicine has been used in many historic epidemics such as the previous two coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 2013 and mers-cov in 2012 and seasonal epidemics caused by influenza viruses and dengue virus fighting against current epidemics also provides an opportunity to test the true value of tcm in treating emerging contagious diseases it is encouraging that controlled clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of tcm in the treatment of sars-cov were conducted and reported we believe that specific and efficient antiviral drugs and therapy will arise from these ongoing and developing drugs especially from the rich tradition of herbal medicines in china  analysis of therapeutic targets for sars-cov-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods canrong wu yang liu yueying yang peng zhang wu zhong yali wang qiqi wang yang xu mingxue li xingzhou li mengzhu zheng lixia chen hua li   coronaviruses covs have caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 101

2 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov broke out in the arabian peninsula in 2012 with a fatality rate of 353

4 both sars-cov and mers-cov are zoonotic viruses and their hosts are batcivet and dromedary respectively5

6 to date no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus therefore covs are considered to be a kind of viruses of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans because wuhan viral pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019 the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov by the world health organization who on january 12 20207

8 since 2019-ncov is highly homologous with sars-cov it is considered a close relative of sars-cov the international virus classification commission ictv classified 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on february 11 2020 at the same time who named the disease caused by 2019-ncov as covid-19 common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and dyspnea in more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome kidney failure and even death there is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by sars-cov-29 covs are enveloped viruses with a positive rna genome belonging to the coronaviridae family of the order nidovirales which are divided into four genera    and  the sars-cov-2 belongs to the  genus covs contain at least four structural proteins spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein and nucleocapsid n protein10 among them spike promotes host attachment and viruscell membrane fusion during virus infection therefore spike determines to some extent the host range potential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target one is acting on the human immune system or human cells and the other is on coronavirus itself in terms of the human immune system the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response11 blocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect in addition viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells for example the sars virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor12 13 14 and the mers binds to the dpp4 receptor15

16 the therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral rna through acting on the genetic material of the virus inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the viruss self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins in the fight against coronavirus scientists have come up with three strategies for developing new drugs17 the first strategy is to test existing broad-spectrum anti-virals18 interferons ribavirin and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category the advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics dosages used potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections but the disadvantage is that these therapies are too broad-spectrum and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner and their side effects should not be underestimated the second strategy is to use existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have therapeutic effect on coronavirus19

20 high-throughput screening makes this strategy possible and new functions of many drug molecules can be found through this strategy for example the discovery of anti-hiv infection drug lopinavirritonavir the third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch theoretically the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years or even more than 10 years11 for the development of medicines treating sars-cov-2 the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs once the efficacy is determined it can be approved by the green channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients herein bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted and the proteins of sars-cov-2 were compared with other coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov we conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures including viral papain like protease plpro main protease 3clpro also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase spike etc further we used these proteins and human relative proteins human ace2 and type-ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 enzymes as targets to screen zinc u s food and drug administration fda-approved drug database zinc drug database zdd our own database of traditional chinese

wuhan-hu-1 was aligned with whole database using blastn to search for homology viral genomes after phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species we found three coronaviruses from bat 96 88 and 88 for bat-cov ratg13 bat-sl-covzxc12 and bat-sl-covzc45 respectively have the highest genome sequence identity to sars-cov-2 fig 1
a moreover as shown in fig 1b bat-cov ratg13 exhibited the closest linkage with sars-cov-2 these phylogenetic evidences suggest that sars-cov-2 may be evolved from bat covs especially ratg13 among all coronaviruses from human sars-cov 80 exhibited the highest genome sequence identity to sars-cov-2 and mersisolate nl13845 also has 50 identity with sars-cov-2 sars-cov is the most clearly studied one among all these viruses according to previous literatures structure and function of its most genome encoded proteins have been elucidated in recent years in this study because of high genome identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the structure and function prediction of sars-cov-2 genome encoded protein were mainly based on those researches on homology protein in sars-cov sars-cov-2 genome has 10 open reading frames fig 2
a orf1ab encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab after cleaved by two proteases replicase proteins showed multifunction involved in transcription and replication of viral rnas orf2-10 encodes viral structural proteins such as s m n and e proteins and other auxiliary proteins the s m e proteins are involved in the formation of the viral coat and the n protein is involved in the packaging of the rna genome fig 2c by aligning with the amino acid sequence of sars pp1ab and analyzing the characteristics of restriction cleavage sites recognized by 3clpro and plpro we speculated 14 specific proteolytic sites of 3clpro and plpro in sars-cov-2 pp1ab fig 2b plpro cleaves three sites at 181182 818819 and 27632764 at the n-terminus and 3clpro cuts at the other 11 sites at the c-terminus and forming 15 non-structural proteins among them nsp3 contains multiple domains including a segment of sars unique domain and a deubiquitination and proteolytic enzyme plpro nsp5 is 3clpro nsp12 is an rdrp and nsp13 is helicase as a new coronavirus structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage until now only one crystal structure of 3clpro has been deposited in pdb pdb code 6lu7 in order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening we aligned all protein sequences from sars-cov-2 with all sequences in pdb1018 database in fold  function assignment system supporting information figs s19s34 fortunately most of these proteins have found their high homology proteins that have three-dimensional structure with homology between 7299 supporting information table s1 those pdb codes were labeled below the corresponding sequences in fig 2b unsurprisingly all these proteins with the highest homology are from sars nevertheless there are some proteins still have not high homologous in the database after the prediction of transmembrane helices in these proteins carried out in tmhmm server as expected we found that all these proteins are transmembrane proteins except for nsp2 supporting information figs s35s41 so far we have found as much structural information of this viral proteins as possible which provides the basis for subsequent homology modeling and drug screening before homology modeling all these proteins sequences were aligned with model sequences derived from sars-cov and predicted secondary structure as the same time fig 3
a and table s1 interestingly as shown in fig 3a important anti-virus drug target protein like 3clpro plpro and rdrp are highly conserved between those two human coronaviruses especially in functional region as shown in table s1 all these potential drug target proteins have been homologously modeled and all generated protein models were provided as the pdb files in supporting information all other coordinates of target-screening hit complexes can be provided upon request in order to verify the accuracy of homologous modeling we aligned the computational structure of the sars-cov-2 3clpro that modeled from the sars-cov 3clpro with its crystal structure of sars-cov-2 3clpro 6lu7 just solved and released during this manuscript was being prepared the computational model of sars-cov-2 3clpro showed a c rmsd of 0471  on the overall structure compared to the sars-cov-2 3clpro structure fig 3b whats more the c rmsd between their substrate binding regions is only 0126  showing very subtle difference ace2 molecule was known as a human entry receptor for spike which facilitates its cross-species transmission sequence alignment results show that the homology of the spike-receptor binding domain rbd sequence between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is 76 fig 3c recent researches speculated that sars-cov-2 could also bind to ace2 and this was verified by computational docking and elisa measurement24

25 moreover homology of the spike-rbd sequence between sars-cov-2 and bat-cov ratg13 is as high as 95 despite the high homology of ratg13 and sars-cov-2 in spike sequence our analysis found that four among the five most important amino acids l465 l495 y502 d510 and h514 that bind to ace212 in bat-cov ratg13 differ from sars-cov-2 fig 3c and there is no related research literature about whether bat-cov ratg13 can infect human yet we also performed homology modeling on the bat-cov ratg13 spike rbd supporting information fig s1 three spike rbd structures have been docked with human ace2 among them for the conformations which most resemble the crystal structure of sars rbdace2 complex26 the binding free energy between sars-cov-2 spike rbd and human ace2 was 3372 kcalmol supporting information fig s2 that between sars-cov spike rbd and ace2 was 4922 kcalmol supporting information fig s3 and that between bat-cov ratg13 spike rbd and ace2 was 3106 kcalmol supporting information fig s4 plpro is responsible for the cleavages of n-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release nsp1 nsp2 and nsp3 which is essential for correcting virus replication27 plpro was also confirmed to be significant to antagonize the hosts innate immunity28 29 30 as an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host plpro has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors it is very valuable for targeting plpro to treat coronavirus infections but no inhibitor has been approved by the fda for marketing the screening results table 1

a and b the strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between ribavirin with the enzyme imply it may be a potent plpro inhibitor the 3clpro also known as nsp5 is first automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes and then further cleaves downstream nsps at 11 sites to release nsp4nsp1631 3clpro directly mediates the maturation of nsps which is essential in the life cycle of the virus the detailed investigation on the structure and catalytic mechanism of 3clpro makes 3clpro an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug development inhibitors targeting at sars-cov 3clpro mainly include peptide inhibitors and small-molecule inhibitors

 3clpro monomer has three domains domain i residues 8101 domain ii residues 102184 and domain iii residues 201303 and a long loop residues 185200 connects domains ii and iii the active site of 3clpro is located in the gap between domains i and ii and has a cyshis catalytic dyad cys145 and his4133 as shown in table 3
and supporting excel file 3clproxlsx anti-bacterial drugs lymecycline demeclocycline doxycycline and oxytetracycline anti-hypertensive drugs nicardipine and telmisartan and conivaptan treating hyponatremia show highest binding affinity to 3clpro several natural compounds and derivatives with anti-virus and anti-inflammatory effects also exhibited high binding affinity to 3clpro table 4

a montelukast was well fitted into the active pocket of 3clpro in which lots of hydrophobic amino acids just like thr24 leu27 his41 phe140 cys145 his163 met165 pro168 and his172 compose a relatively hydrophobic environment to contain the compound and stabilize its conformation hydrogen bonding was predicted between asn142 and the carbonyl group of the compound fig 5b nsp12 a conserved protein in coronavirus is an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the vital enzyme of coronavirus replicationtranscription complex the rdrp domain of polymerase is located at the c-terminus and has a conserved ser-asp-asp motif34 nsp8 can de novo synthesize up to 6 nucleotides in length which can be used as a primer for nsp12-rdrp rna synthesis further the nsp7nsp8 complex increases the binding of nsp12 to rna and enhances the rdrps enzyme activity of nsp1235 in the research of sars-cov and mers-cov inhibitors nsp12-rdrp has been used as a very important drug target in principle targeted inhibition of nsp12-rdrp could not cause significant toxicity and side effects on host cells but no specific inhibitors have been found until now36 virtual screening results of rdrp demonstrated some drugs might be potential inhibitors with mfscores lower than 110 such as several anti-fungal drug itraconazole anti-bacterial drug novobiocin gallstone-dissolving drug chenodeoxycholic acid anti-allergic drug cortisone anti-tumor drug idarubicin hepatoprotective drug silybin muscle relaxant drug pancuronium bromide and chronic enteritis anti-coagulant drug dabigatran etexilate table 5

39 based on structure modeling of helicase protein anti-bacterial drugs lymecycline cefsulodine and rolitetracycline anti-fungal drug itraconazole anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 drug saquinavir anti-coagulant drug dabigatran and diuretic drug canrenoic acid were predicted to be helicase inhibitors with high mfscores through virtual ligand screening the natural products such as many flavanoids from different sources -glucosyl hesperidin hesperidin rutin quercetagetin 6-o--d-glucopyranoside and homovitexin xanthones 35-dimethoxy-1-6-o--d-xylopyranosyl--d-glucopyranosyloxy-9h-xanthen-9-one kouitchenside h kouitchenside a 82-dihydroxy-345-trimethoxy-1-6-o--d-xylopyranosyl--d-glucopyranosyloxy-9h-xanthen-9-one kouitchenside d 1-hydroxy-26-dimethoxy-8-6-o--d-xylopyranosyl--d-glucopyranosyloxy-9h-xanthen-9-one and triptexanthoside d from swertia genus phyllaemblicin b and phyllaemblinol from phyllanthus emblica showed high binding affinity to this target besides the above targets some non-structural proteins including nsp3b nsp3e nsp7nsp8 complex nsp9 nsp10 nsp14 nsp15 and nsp16 also play an important role in the virus rna synthesis and replication suggesting these proteins may be useful targets for the anti-viral drug discovery the virtual screening results showed many anti-bacterial anti-viral or anti-inflammatory drugs from zinc drug database and our in-house natural productsderivatives database displayed potential good affinity to these targets and the detailed information of virtual screening results is shown in supporting excel files for zdd screening results file names as targetxlsx for natural products screening results file names as targetnpxlsx spike is the main structural protein of coronavirus and assembles into a special corolla structure on the surface of the virus as a trimer spike is a main protein that interacts with the host by binding to host cell receptors to mediate virus invasion and determine viral tissue or host tropism40 spike is cleaved into s1 and s2 by the host cell protease like tmprss2 etc the main function of s1 is to bind with host cell surface receptors and the s2 subunit mediates viruscell and cellcell membrane fusion spike structural integrity and cleavage activation play a key role in virus invasion and virulence41 therapeutic strategies to block coronavirus from entering host cells by targeting spike proteins or specific receptors on the host surface are valuable for the development of anti-viral drugs on the basis of virtual screening results of small-molecule compounds against spike protein some drugs showed high binding affinity mfscore150 or score35 such as anti-hypertensive drugs rescinnamine iloprost and prazosin anti-fungal drugs posaconazole and itraconazole anti-bacterial drug sulfasalazine azlocillin penicillin and cefsulodin and anti-coagulant drug dabigatran etexilate some natural flavanoids licoflavonol from glycyrrhiza uralensis cosmosiinfrom scutellaria baicalensis neohesperidin from citrus aurantium mangostinfrom garcinia mangostana kouitchenside d from swertia kouitchensis excoecariatoxin from excoecaria agallocha phyllaemblicin g7 from phyllanthus emblica and piceatannol from vitis vinifera exhibited high binding affinity the detailed virtual screening results are shown in supporting excel files however most of above compounds were not predicted to bind with the binding interface of the spikeace2 complex the only compound that could target the binding interface between spike and ace2 was hesperidin as shown in fig 6
a hesperidin was predicted to lie on the middle shallow pit of the surface of rbd of spike where the dihydroflavone part of the compound went parallel with the -6 sheet of rbd and the sugar part was inserted into the shallow pit in the direction away from ace2 where a few hydrophobic amino acids including tyr436 try440 leu442 phe443 phe476 try475 try481 and tyr49 form a relatively hydrophobic shallow pocket to contain the compound fig 6b hydrogen bonding was predicted between tyr440 and the compound by superimposing the ace2rbd complex to the hesperidinrbd complex a distinct overlap of hesperidin with the interface of ace2 could be observed fig 6c suggesting hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ace2 with rbd except for spike protein e protein e-channel possesses important biological functions for the structural integrity of coronavirus and host virulence nrbd and crbd of coronavirus n protein are needed for n proteins in host cells to bind with coronavirus rna efficiently therefore e protein or n protein nrbd and crbd domains can be used as targets for the discovery of anti-viral drugs through virtual screening many anti-bacterial anti-viral anti-tumor anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory drugs etc from zinc database and our in-house natural productsderivatives database were found to display relatively good affinity to these targets and the detailed results of virtual screening are given in supplementary excel files there are three coronavirus virulence factors nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a related to interfering hosts innate immunity and assisting coronavirus immune escape nsp1 interacts with host 40s ribosomal subunit that induces specifically host mrna degradation42 and also inhibits type-i interferon production43 nsp3c has ability to bind with hosts adp-ribose to help coronavirus resist host innate immunity44 bone marrow matrix antigen 2 bst-2 can inhibit the release of newly-assembled coronavirus from host cells sars-cov orf7a directly binds to bst-2 and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation of bst-245 these evidences suggest that nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a may be potential targets for anti-viral drug discovery the detailed screening results of nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a showed that a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited relatively high binding affinity to these three target proteins such as piperacillin cefpiramide streptomycin lymecycline tetracycline platycodin d from platycodon grandifloras wogonoside from scutellaria baicalensis vitexin from vitex negundo andrographolide derivatives and xanthones from swertia genus the detailed results of virtual screening are shown in supporting excel files the host ace2 has been proved by many studies to be the specific receptor for the spike rbd of sars-cov12 the latest research shows that the host receptor of sars-cov-2 is consistent with sars-cov exhibiting that the spike rbd sequence of sars-cov-2 is similar to sars-cov rbd and there are important interactions between several key amino acid residues of rbd receptor-binding motif and ace224 based on the current research progress ace2 is considered as a host target for the treatment of coronavirus infection to block sars-cov-2 from entering host cells based on the virtual screening results of ace2 protein anti-diabetes drug troglitazone anti-hypertensive drug losartan analgesia drug ergotamine anti-bacterial drug cefmenoxime and hepatoprotective drug silybin etc were predicted to bind with ace2 with low energy the natural products such as phyllaemblicin g7 from phyllanthus emblica xanthones from the plants of swertiagenus neohesperidin and hesperidin from citrus aurantium exhibited potentially high binding affinity to ace2 protein however none of above ace2 binding compounds was predicted to target the ace2rbd interface in addition tmprss2 was known to cut the spike to trigger the infection of sars-cov and mers-cov studies have shown that inhibiting the enzyme activity of tmprss2 can prevent some coronaviruses from entering host cells46 as a possible target for anti-viral drug discovery the virtual screen results shown in supporting excel files predicted many anti-bacterial drugs pivampicillin hetacillin cefoperazone and clindamycin and anti-virus natural compounds phyllaemblicin g7 neoandrographolide kouitchenside i etc to be potential tmprss2 inhibitors in order to further verify the screening results of zinc drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat sars-cov-2 infections the compounds were docked with 19 constructed targets of sars-cov-2 and 2 human targets to predict their possible targets and also to search possible binding partners of certain important targets special attentions were paid to the drugs currently in clinical trials all results of calculated docking scores were listed in the supporting excel file anti-viralsvstargetsscores significant scores score32 mfscore110 were highlighted in brighten yellow remdesivir gs-5734 a nucleoside analogue is an rdrp inhibitor it can inhibit virus by inhibiting synthesis of viral nucleic acid and has not yet been approved for marketing in any country on january 31 of this year the new england journal of medicine reported the diagnosis and treatment of the first sars-cov-2 patient in the united states47 remdesivir showed some potential in the treatment of the first patient with novel coronavirus infection on vero e6 cells the ec50 of remdesivir for sars-cov-2 is 077 moll and the selection index si is greater than 12948 remdesivir is currently undergoing a randomized double-blind controlled phase iii clinical study in china our molecular docking results show that the potential targets of remdesivir is nsp3b score365 rdrp mfscores1128 e-channel mfscore1251 and tmprss2 score3623 mfscores1094 for rdrp from generated docking model remdesivir could bind to the rna-binding channel of the sars-cov-2 rdrp and the binding mode and site were highly similar to that of coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 rdrp inhibitor gpc-n11449the binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the rna template channel which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide fig 7
a and b the compound was well fitted with the shape of the pocket where it formed three hydrogen bonds with asn497 arg569 and asp684 in addition hydrophobic interactions with leu576 ala685 and tyr687 may further direct the favorite conformation of remdesivir fig 7c interestingly remdesivir was predicted to bind with the target tmprss2 with low binding energy for both score and mfscore as shown in fig 8
a remdesivir was bound in a relatively positively-charged allosteric pocket which is far away from the enzyme active center asn84 and arg405 formed two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of the compound weak hydrophobic interaction between the pyrrolotriazine ring of remdesivir with tyr131 and try401 and side chains of some polar amino acids may further stabilize the compound conformation fig 8b lopinavir and ritonavir have been marketed in china and are mainly used to treat hiv-1 infection in adults and children over 2 years of age in vitro studies have shown that lopinavir and ritonavir can inhibit the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov to exert anti-viral effects the drug is listed as a recommended drug in the anti-viral drugs section of the new coronavirus infected pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program the molecular docking results showed that ritonavirs possible target is nsp3c or e-channel with the mfscores of 152100 and 277769 respectively lopinavirs possible target is nsp3b nsp3c helicase nrbd or e-channel with the mfscores of 158050 189140 114018 171127 and 221785 respectively arbidol is a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug mainly for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza a and b viruses etc in recent years many studies have proven its effectiveness against both sars-cov and mers-cov arbidol hydrochloride can block virus replication by inhibiting the fusion of the lipid membrane of the virus with the host cells compared with the untreated control group arbidol can effectively inhibit coronavirus up to 60 times at a concentration of 1030 moll and significantly inhibit the viruss pathological effects on cells the docking results of arbidol with the possible drug targets of the new coronavirus showed that it may interact with nsp7nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 e-channel or spike with the mfscores of 136087 118253 118253 117879 and 145125 respectively darunavir is an hiv-1 protease inhibitor that selectively inhibits the cleavage of hiv-encoded gag-pol polyprotein in virally infected cells thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles at a concentration of 300 moll darunavir can significantly inhibit virus replication and the inhibition efficiency is 280 times compared with the untreated group our docking results showed that the possible targets of darunavir are nsp3c plpro e-channel or spike proteins with the mfscores of 126149 110759 157184 and 111865 respectively favipiravir a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug is used to treat flu the shenzhen health commission has now initiated clinical studies on the use of favipiravir to treat sars-cov-2 infections while the scores of favipiravir docking with the targets in our virtual screening are relatively low chloroquine phosphate has been used in the treatment of malaria since the 1940s and later in rheumatoid arthritis chloroquine has been reported in some earlier studies to have direct anti-viral effects such as inhibiting flavivirus retrovirus such as hiv and many coronaviruses recent study showed that with ec50 of 113 moll and si greater than 88 chloroquine can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 in the cell level its efficiency in the human body for sars-cov-2 infection has not yet been clinically proven chloroquine phosphate was turned into chloroquine in the body to play therapeutic effect our docking results showed that the possible target of chloroquine is nsp3b or e-channel with the docking mfscores of 130355 and 107889 respectively we also performed the longitudinal analysis on the drugs against 21 targets and the results showed that only tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and beclabuvir may bind to nsp1 fewer compounds were predicted to act on some targets such as nsp1 nsp3e nsp9 nsp10 nsp16 nrbd crbd orf7a and tmprss2 showing that these selected anti-viral drugs are unlikely to acting on the above targets of the new coronavirus which provides a meaningful reference for our future research for other targets such as nsp3b nsp3c nsp7nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 plpro 3clpro rdrp helicase e-channel spike and ace2 more anti-viral drugs were predicted to bind with them especially e-channel rdrp 3clpro and plpro indicating that these targets are more likely to be useful for the discovery of sars-cov-2 therapeutic drugs from known anti-virals and should be the focus of our subsequent research the ongoing sars-cov-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current options for treating life-threatening zoonotic coronavirus infections are very limited although the outbreaks of sars in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 triggered extensive research efforts there are currently no drugs that can treat any zoonotic coronavirus the transient nature of this epidemic is one of the major reasons why no prototype coronavirus inhibitor has progressed to the early preclinical stage to date as with the sars virus 17 years ago and the current sars-cov-2 emerging coronaviruses in the future may continue to pose a threat to global public health therefore finding broad-spectrum inhibitors that may reduce the effects of human coronavirus infection remains a challenging research focus given the time-consuming nature of anti-viral drug development and registration existing treatments for other diseases may be the only fastest treatment option for emerging infectious diseases for most of these drugs that have been prepared the medication has sufficient experience and dosage and their safety and adme situation are well known in this study based on the results of bioinformatics analysis 20 homology structures of 18 sars-cov-2 proteins and 1 human protein were built plus human ace2 structure totally 21 targets were setup for high throughput virtual ligand screening the special double scoring system icm-pro soft allowed us to evaluate the docking results more accurately the score of icm software is calculated by the overall empirical function of predicted physical interaction whiles the mfscore mean force score is computed by the knowledge-based potential functions derived from statistics of ligandreceptor complex in pdb50

51 from proteinprotein docking results we can deduce that sars-cov-2 spike protein have strong binding affinity to human ace2 although weaker than that of sars-cov spike protein unexpectedly bat-cov ratg13 spike protein only has slightly weaker binding affinity with ace2 compared to sars-cov-2 it is speculated that the virus may be capable of infecting humans directly or it is close if sars-cov-2 evolved from bat-cov ratg13 there may be no more than one or two host evolutions involved but there are no published articles that directly related to intermediate hosts yet according to the most recent research paper on the clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 infection52 sars-cov-2 can spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission this was consistent with observed proteinprotein docking results of sars-cov-2 spike rbd and human ace2 for both of ours and previous prediction25 however the fast growing incidents of sars-cov-2 pneumonia and related deaths implied the weaker binding of sars-cov-2 spike with human ace2 compared to sars spike may not fully explained the current situation of this epidemic there must have some other receptors of sars-cov-2 or infection facilitating mechanisms in the human host or sars-cov-2 spike-rbd may take other lower energy binding conformation different from current sars-cov spike-rbd conformation found in the crystal structure probably by induce fitting these need to be further investigated to search potential coronavirus therapeutic drugs as soon as possible we first screened potential compounds from a zinc drug database 2924 compounds and a small in-house database of natural products about 1066 compounds a series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-viral anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects exhibited high binding affinity to different target proteins indicating their potential utility for treating sars-cov-2 we have identified a number of compounds that might have anti-viral activity from the approved drugs library such as anti-virus drugs ribavirin valganciclovir and thymidine anti-bacterial drugs cefpiramide sulfasalazine phenethicillin lymecycline demeclocycline doxycycline oxytetracycline and tigecycline anti-asthmatic drugs montelukast fenoterol and reproterol and hepatoprotective drug silybin the original pharmacological actions of these drugs could be helpful for the therapy of viral infection pneumonia the natural products such as flavanoids like neohesperidin hesperidin baicalin kaempferol 3-o-rutinoside and rutin from different sources andrographolide neoandrographolide and 14-deoxy-1112-didehydroandrographolide from andrographis paniculata and a series of xanthones from the plants of swertia genus with anti-virus anti-bacteria and anti-inflammation activity could effectively interact with these targets of sars-cov-2 therefore the herbal medicines containing these compounds as major components might be meaningful for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infections for ace2 target although several compounds could bind with ace2 through virtual screening in our studies no compound was found to bind with the contact surface of ace2spike complex suggesting that these compounds are only the inhibitors of ace2 enzyme activities rather than inhibitors of ace2 driven virus infections just like what described in recently published research53 most of selected compounds are also unable to bind with the contact surface of ace2spike complex actually these potential ace2 inhibitors may not be suitable to use as drugs for treating sars-cov-2 infection because the poor prognosis would be induced by the inhibition of ace2 enzyme activities for ace2 was considered as a protective factor of lung injury54 for those targets which are difficult to find direct inhibitors or non-druggable targets just like nsp1 nsp3b nsp3c and e-channel etc currently popular protac technology may be a good strategy to degrade these proteins and then inhibit the virus the potential binding compounds found in this study for these targets might be a good start point for spike protein we found only one compound natural hesperidin was targeting the binding between spike rbd and human ace2 however not like the ace2 binding compounds non-interface binding compound may still meaningful applications considering that the fusion of covs membrane with host cell membrane need the big conformational change of remained spike part after rbd removal55 any small molecule bound to spike at this time may interfere the re-folding of spike therefore inhibits the viral infection process furthermore small molecule that can target any part of spike protein may be a good start point to design protac based therapy also we dock existing anti-viral drugs with our targets analyze the possible targets of each anti-viral drug horizontally and analyze the drugs that may interact with 21 targets vertically we analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that nsp3b nsp3c nsp7nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 plpro 3clpro rdrp helicase e-channel spike and ace2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs the three targets nsp3b nsp3c and e-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs this may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein nsp3b and nsp3c or partial model e-channel whether the screened anti-viral drugs really work on these targets needs further verification we also do not recommend the application of new coronavirus pneumonia to compounds for which no target has been predicted the triphosphate nucleotide product of remdesivir remdesivir-tp competes with rdrp for substrate atp so it can interfere with viral rna synthesis our docking results show that remdesivir-tp binds to sars-cov-2 rdrp with a score of 1128 and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism so we think remdesivir may be good in treating sars-cov-2 pneumonia in addition remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human tmprss2 a protein facilitating the virus infection this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research chloroquine phosphate has shown better anti-sars-cov-2 effects in recent studies but this drug has no clear target of action in our docking results chloroquine phosphate is predicted to possibly combine with nsp3b and e-channel but we need to do further experiments to verify this conclusion in response to the recently reported anti-aids drugs lopinavir and ritonavir tablets which have a poor effect on the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and have toxic side effects we analyzed it in conjunction with the docking results the molecular docking results show that ritonavirs possible target is nsp3c or e-channel lopinavirs possible target is nsp3b nsp3c helicase nrbd or e-channel some of these targets such as nsp3b nsp3c e-channel may be false positives due to the model inaccuracy for small flexible protein or partial model for both lopinavir and ritonavir we did not observe possible binding to major targets like 3clpro plpro rdrp and so on this docking result implies lopinavir and ritonavir tablets may not be suitable for treatment of sars-cov-2 infections the results of the entire article are based on computer virtual screening we have not conduct further in vivo and in vitro anti-viral experiments yet because we want to share our results with scientists in anti-sars-cov-2 research as soon as possible our subsequent research will try to solve the three-dimensional structures of all 24 proteins of sars-cov-2 and their drug complexes providing more target information for drug intervention and long-term drug design perform in vivo and in vitro evaluations for candidate drugs

the covid-19 patient experience with a wuhan evacuee a case report sandeep segar daniel bouland francesca torriani kevin kwak deepak asudani randy taplitz vineet gupta   a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases linked to the huanan seafood market in wuhan china was first reported on december 31 2019 1 after testing negative for common respiratory viruses these patients tested positive for a novel coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2 3 some of these initial patients demonstrated hypoxemia ground glass opacification on chest imaging abnormal laboratory results - low white blood cell wbc count low absolute lymphocyte count alc low platelet count elevated liver enzymes and elevated creatinine 2 covid-19 was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization with over 750000 confirmed cases in over 200 countries and territories as of march 31 2020 4 we report the case of an early patient with covid-19 who was evacuated from wuhan china and developed signs of infection at a southern california quarantine facility this case highlights our patients clinical course including relevant history diagnostic work-up medical management and challenges in defining non-infectivity a 51-year-old chinese woman with no significant past medical history presented to our institution with a 1-day history of fevers chills sweats nonproductive cough from a southern california quarantine facility she had worked as a nurse in an outpatient medicine clinic in wuhan china where she cared for patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms but without confirmed diagnoses of covid-19 while caring for these patients she reported wearing a standard surgical mask and gloves three weeks prior to hospital admission upon becoming aware of a rapidly spreading pulmonary infection within her community our patient took leave from work and self-isolated herself in her apartment with her husband and grandson neither of whom had signs of infection she had no direct exposure to the huanan seafood market four days prior to hospital admission she and her grandson were evacuated on a flight from the wuhan international airport late the next day she arrived at a southern california government facility for an intended 14-day quarantine one day prior to admission our patient developed a nonproductive cough fever chills and sweats the same day nasopharyngeal np and oropharyngeal op swabs for covid-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr were sent from the quarantine facility to the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc laboratory per recommended guidelines appendix the following day she was admitted to our institution and was placed in contact droplet and airborne isolation precautions per cdc recommendations at admission her temperature was 384 c blood pressure was 10169 mm hg heart rate was 84 beats per minute respiratory rate was 17 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 96 on room air a physical examination including cardiopulmonary evaluation was unremarkable laboratory studies were notable for wbc 3600 per mm3 range 410010400mm3 absolute neutrophil count anc 2100 per mm3 alc 1000 per mm3 and platelet count 121000 per mm3 other test results including liver function tests coagulation studies procalcitonin and urinalysis were unremarkable a np swab using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr was negative for usual viral pathogens including influenza ab respiratory syncytial virus human rhinovirusenterovirus human metapneumovirus parainfluenza and four common coronavirus strains previously known to cause human illness 229e hku1 nl63 and oc43 a chest x-ray demonstrated clear lung fields bilaterally without consolidation or effusion fig 2a serial np and op swabs were tested every other day per cdc guidance to evaluate clearance of infection no antibiotics were given to our patient np and op swabs from the day prior to admission returned positive for covid-19 and our patient became the 14th confirmed case in the united states during days 16 of hospitalization she experienced daily fevers chills drenching night sweats and a nonproductive cough by day 3 she had dyspnea with minimal exertion exacerbated by coughing fits she also had diminished appetite with occasional nausea she denied abdominal pain diarrhea or dysuria between days 3 and 6 her maximum temperature tmax ranged from 390 c to 397 c fig 1 her blood pressure remained in low normal range a pulmonary examination demonstrated bibasilar crackles without labored breathing on hospital day 3 her chest x-ray demonstrated new findings of bilateral lower lobe reticular opacities fig 2b her platelets reached a nadir of 101000 per mm3 on day 4 before improving her wbc count improved to 5100 per mm3 on hospital day 5 however alc decreased to 600 per mm3 on day 6 before recovering fig 1 liver enzymes remained normal until day 6 when aspartate aminotransferase ast rose to 50 ul fig 3 a transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable her chest x-ray on day 6 showed worsened bibasilar reticular opacification fig 2c her blood cultures remained negative during hospitalization a quantiferon-tb test resulted negative treatment was largely supportive during this time comprising intravenous hydration and antipyretic therapy acetaminophen  4 g daily ibuprofen and axillary ice packs
 on day 6 of hospitalization due to persistent high fevers relative hypoxemia evolving chest x-ray findings and mildly abnormal liver function our patient was initiated on compassionate use remdesivir 200 mg intravenous on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily remdesivir an investigational antiviral for covid-19 was previously used in ebola virus disease severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 5 her fever curve improved on day 8 fig 1 our patient continued to have mild dyspnea nausea poor appetite and fatigue her cough became productive of scant white sputum alanine aminotransferase alt peaked at 84 ul on day 10 before trending down fig 3 as of hospital day 11 she remained afebrile off antipyretics her oxygen saturations improved to 97 on ambient air her dyspnea and auscultatory rales resolved however a mild productive cough persisted on hospital day 9 the cdc reported serial np and op swabs from her entire hospitalization to be negative table 1 this included samples at the height of illness severity days 17 due to concerns with the adequacy of negative op and np testing in defining infection clearance sputum pcr for covid-19 on days 10 and 11 were obtained surprisingly both sputum samples returned positive table 1 given the possibility that her productive cough harbored transmissible live virus our patient was discharged on day 15 to a government medical facility for continued isolation until the resolution of all symptoms at the time of transfer she remained afebrile and asymptomatic apart from a mild productive cough our patient returned home after 19 days at the government isolation facility after resolution of her cough she remained non-symptomatic at home when last followed up
 our case helps offer insight into the clinical course of covid-19 patients coronavirus disease is thought to be transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and direct contact 6 despite working as an outpatient nurse it is less likely that she contracted covid-19 at the workplace as symptom onset was 3 weeks after her last known patient contact the incubation period of covid-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days 79 alternatively she may have been exposed during her self-imposed home isolation in wuhan however her apparent contacts including her husband and grandson were asymptomatic her grandson later tested negative for covid-19 there is a likelihood that she was infected during transit to the quarantine facility at either the wuhan international airport or on her flight to the united states exposure at the quarantine facility seems less likely as that would reflect an incubation period of only a day similar to the first documented cohort of covid-19 patients linked to the huanan seafood market our patient had leukopenia and thrombocytopenia both of which recovered during the course of her illness 2 she notably developed lymphopenia on hospital day 6 which also recovered the rise in liver enzymes was more likely related to the disease course of covid-19 than to drug-induced liver injury from remdesivir as enzyme levels down trended to normal during daily antiviral infusions no other clear implicating medications causing liver injury were utilized relative hypoxemia was noted by oxygen saturation however our patient never required supplemental oxygen chest imaging findings were also significant for infiltrates in contrast to the reported cohort 2 renal function in this patient remained normal during the disease course the clinical improvement in our patient coincided with the initiation of remdesivir on day 6 of hospitalization however it is unclear if this improvement can be attributed to the drug andor to the natural course of covid-19 infection ongoing investigational trials will help establish the efficacy of remdesivir and other antivirals in covid-19 management 1012 cdc-guided np and op samples of our patient from hospital day 1 onward all tested negative for covid-19 table 1 although our patient was clinically ill enough to warrant continued hospitalization and initiation of the antiviral remdesivir she would have met laboratory criteria to clear isolation precautions by hospital day 3 with two negative np and op specimens on two separate days during hospital days 17 her high fevers and infectious signs in the setting of np and op negativity question whether our patient was infective at the time or whether these were manifestations of a prolonged excessive cytokine and chemokine response that has been documented in other highly pathogenic coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov 13 our patients positive sputum rt-pcr result for covid-19 likely represented inactive viral shedding in the lower respiratory tract rather than active contagious virus given she had dramatic clinical improvement by hospital day 11 in the 2003 sars-cov outbreak viral shedding was detected in the respiratory gastrointestinal and urinary tracts for many weeks after onset of illness while active transmission of infection was not noted after 2 weeks 14 the pragmatic correlation of sars-cov-2 detection by rt-pcr in sputum np and op samples with infectivity is warranted to explore similar trends for covid-19 further research aimed at the understanding of transmission dynamics will help to guide screening practices and support clearance of infectivity our experience with one of the earliest cases of covid-19 in the united states offers insight into the pertinent clinical and laboratory findings of this novel disease entity use of remdesivir without any overt side effects in our patient supports the ongoing clinical trials as a candidate therapeutic agent in covid-19 in addition the case highlights possible areas for improvement in diagnosing coronavirus disease and robust protocols in establishing clearance of infection to facilitate removal of isolation precautions and safe return of patients to the community these topics are pertinent for controlling disease spread and promoting public safety  drug treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in china zhe jin jing-yi liu rang feng lu ji zi-li jin hai-bo li   although effective prevention and control measures had been taken a total of 8708008 confirmed cases of covid-19 cases have been reported worldwide resulting in 461715 deaths until june 21 2020 the outbreak of covid-19 not only severely threatened the health of people around the world but also had great impact on the global economy on january 30th the world health organization who declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern drugs are regarded as an essential way for preventing and controlling epidemic diseases however drug discovery is a time-cosuming sophisticated and costly process which can be always divided into several important stages including preclinical research clinical trials and additional review process an average of 15 years are requied for an experimental drug to travel from the lab to the patients hughes et al 2011 therefore it is difficult to have an immediate effect on the prevention and control of covid-19 by developing de novo drugs against sars-cov-2 new use of old drugs that is searching for clinically approved drugs that have antiviral activities against sars-cov-2 may be a feasible strategy in the fight against covid-19 alimuddin et al 2016 sachs et al 2017 since pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity are the main considerations that determin the successfulness of novel drug development candidates screened from the existing or licensed drugs in the laboratory could possiblely be translated into clinical use in a faster pace ferreira and andricopulo 2019 han and gifford 2003 pan et al 2018 since the outbreak of covid-19 many research institutions have been using the above-mentioned strategy to screen candidate drugs which could inhibit sars-cov-2 or excess immune responses with their continued efforts drug candidats that display some clinical effects have been included in diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia dtpncp released by national health commission of china the current review summarized the clinical use mechanism and efficacy of the drugs which are recommended in dtpncp but also the novel therapeutic agents which are now undergoing clinical trials approved by nmpa to evaluate the treatment for covid-19 in china reviewing these accumulated experience may provide insight into the epidemic control all over the world the pathogenesis of covid-19 has been revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 including two functional subunits s1 and s2 promoted the binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and the entry into host cells gralinski and menachery 2020 richardson et al 2020 walls et al 2020 the s1 subunit served as the pathway of binding to the host cell receptor and s2 subunit played a role in the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes the spike protein of sars-cov was incorporated without cleavage in contrast the s1s2 site of sars-cov-2 with the unique existence of furin cleavage site was entirely subjected to cleavage during biosynthesis which makes sars-cov-2 virus more aggressive in pathogenicity compared with sars-cov yuki et al 2020 autopsy of covid-19 victims in china has confirmed the exitance of coronavirus particles in the cytoplasm of tracheal and bronchial mucosa epithelia and alveolar type ii pneumocytes under electron microscopy the autopsy has also shown injuries in multiple organs and tissues with prominent and extensive pulmonary lesions caused by sars-cov-2 this was considered as a pathological basis for the lethal respiratory disfunction apparent lesions in lymphatic and hematopoietic organs were also observed bian and team 2020 the body injury may also be associated with the induction of excessive immune responses resulting in self-attack and multiple organ damage zumla et al 2020 in a peripheral blood sample from an early case both cd4 and cd8 t cells were hyper activated which was considered to be responsible for the severe immune injury in this patient xu et al 2020b lopinavirritonavir aluviakaletra developed by alberta is a human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitor which can enhance the antiretroviral activity against the virus by inhibiting cytochrome p450 cvetkovic and goa 2003 lopinavirritonavir was approved for the treatment against hiv infection in the united states in 2000 and was available in china in 2008 during the epidemic of sars it was found that patients with sars treated with the combination of lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin had lower risk of the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or death compared with those treated with ribavirin alone chu et al 2004 in the dtpncp trial version 2 released on january 22 it was declared that there was no existing drug against covid-19 at present and lopinavirritonavir could be tried for no more than 14 days in a study including 47 patients with covid-19 treatment with the combination of lopinavirritonavir and pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs showed a notable therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects compared with treatment of adjuvant drugs alone ye et al 2020 however a randomized controlled open-label trial conducted by bin cao et al observed no benefit with lopinavirritiomnavir treatment cao et al 2020 and trials in the mild covid-19 cases also showed similar results cheng et al 2020 morever lopinavirritonavir was found to be related to the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission causing a prolonged length of stay fan et al 2020 chloroquine phosphate is mainly used as an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of malaria and rheumatic diseases bijker et al 2013 previous studies have also found that it has broad-spectrum antiviral effects delvecchio et al 2016 mizui et al 2010 chloroquine can strongly bind to the nuclear protein and decrease the twist of the double helix of dna forming a complex and preventing the replication of dna or the transcription of rna in addition chloroquine can cause ph changes of endosomes and it is also an effective autophagy inhibitor which interferes with viral infection and replication by affecting autophagy schultz and gilman 1997 besides the antiviral activity chloroquines also have the immunomodulatory ability which may enhance its antiviral abilities in vivo apart from chloroquine phosphate hydroxychloroquine is also an antimalarial drug used in clinical setting which has the similar structure and mechanism to those of chloroquine but is less toxic ben-zvi et al 2012 it was found that chloroquine phosphate could effectively inhibit the infection of sars-cov-2 at the cellular level 50 effective concentration ec50  113 m semi-cytotoxic concentration cc50  100 m and selection index si  8850 in a joint study wang et al 2020a as of may 23rd there are 22 ongoing clinical trials using chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 in china cortegiani et al 2020 a multi-center prospective observational study in china including 197 cases showed that the clearance rate of viral rna in the chloroquine group was significantly higher and faster than that in the non-chloroquine group after 14 days 959 and 796 but the rate of adverse reactions showed no significant difference in the two groups huang et al 2020 however a recent randomized trial in brazil to evaluate effect of high and low-dose chloroquine diphosphate as adjunctive therapy for patients with sars-cov-2 infection suggested that high-dose chloroquine diphosphate was not recommended for the treatment of critically ill patients because of potential safety hazards borba et al 2020 azithromycin together with hydroxychloroquine effectively reduced the viral carriage at d6 post-inclusion and led to a much lower average carrying duration compared with controls the potential effect of hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 may be reinforced by azithoromycin gautret et al 2020 however in a recent observational study of hydroxychloroquine in clinic from march 7th to april 8th no association between hydroxychloroquine and changed risk of the composite end point of intubation or death was found indicating that covid-19 may be unsensitive to hydroxychloroquine geleris et al 2020 generally existing evidence is not enough to further clarify recommendations for hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with covid-19 more randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to provide convincible information abidol is a non-nucleoside antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical chemistry research center of the former soviet union which shows the antiviral activity against many viruses kadam and wilson 2017 pcheur et al 2007 the main indication of abidol is the disease caused by influenza a and b viruses abidol specifically inhibits the contact adhesion and fusion of the viral lipid envelope and the host cell membrane and blocks viral genes from penetrating into the nucleus inhibiting the synthesis of viral dna or rna by activating 2-oligoadenylate synthetase antiviral protein in vivo abidol was first approved in russia in 1993 and is now mainly used in russia and china but has not been approved by western countries abidol showed an efficient inhibitory ability against sars-cov-2 infection in vitro with the ec50 at 411 355473 m wang et al 2020b it was predicted in structural and molecular dynamics studies that arbidol may target the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and block the trimerization of spike glycoprotein which is a key for host cell adhesion and hijacking vankadari 2020 a retrospective cohort study found that arbidol and lopinavirritonavir treatment showed more favorable clinical response in treating covid-19 deng et al 2020 also another retrospective study including 50 cases indicated that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavirritonavir in which no viral load was detected in arbidol group but the viral load was found in 15 441 patients treated with lopinavirritonavir after 14 days zhu et al 2020 ribavirin a purine nucleoside analog is a broad-spectrum nucleoside antiviral drug during the epidemic of sars and mers it has been widely adopted in clinical setting but its efficacy is still controversial chunxiao yang et al 2020 ribavirin is metabolized intracellularly into 5-phosphate derivatives that directly or indirectly inhibit viral replication and is rapidly excreted in the human body as a prototype or as a derived glycosylation product gilbert and knight 1986 it is mainly used for severe hospitalized patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus rsv the patients with lassa fever or epidemic hemorrhagic fever with manifestations of the renal syndrome and those with chronic hepatitis c and viral upper respiratory tract infection zehua zhang et al 2020 because of the direct antiviral activity of ribavirin against sars-cov-2 its usage has been considered as dosage guidelines for testing new therapeutic concepts khalili et al 2020 molecular docking results showed that the potential target of ribavirin was rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of sars-cov-2 elfiky 2020 it was recommended that ribavirin should be used in combination with alpha-interferon or lopinavirritonavir 500 mg per adult 2 to 3 times per day and be given by intravenous infusion and the course of treatment should not exceed ten days zehua zhang et al 2020 glucocorticoids are not only the most important hormones regulating stress response but also the most widely used and effective anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant agent in clinic allan et al 1984 glucocorticoids are fat-soluble hormones that pass through the cell membrane and bind to glucocorticoid receptor gr gr is a macromolecular complex of 90 kda which is composed of heat shock protein hsp90 and p59 protein hsp90 dissociates from the complex and the activated gcs-gr complex rapidly enters the nucleus binds to the glucocorticoid response components on the target gene promoter in the form of a dimer and thus to promotes or inhibits the transcription of the target gene and finally produces pharmacological effects or side effects by regulating the gene products wilckens and rijk 1997 in addition gcs-gr complex interacts with other transcription factors such as nf-b to inhibit the expression of inflammatory genes and directly influence the gene regulation and anti-inflammation rhen and cidlowski 2005 schcke et al 2002 in emergency or critical cases glucocorticoid is often the first choice for the treatment for primary or secondary pituitary adrenocortical dysfunction mainly combined with physiological dose of hydrocortisone or cortisone as a supplementary or replacement therapy the common clinical glucocorticoids are prednisone methylprednisone betamethasone beclomethasone propionate prednisone prednisolone hydrocortisone and dexamethasone etc glucocorticoids had been used to treat sars and mers resulting in lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay and were not associated with significant secondary lower respiratory infection and other complications however more evidence is needed either for supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with sars-cov-2 infection qin et al 2020 a phase ii and iii clinical trial of methylprednisolone for treatment of covid-19 were carried out in china nct04244591 but no results were reported yet in a study including 66 patients recovered after treatment a remarkable lasting of viral rna detection in oropharyngeal swabs and feces from covid-19 patients treated with corticosteroid was reported ling yun et al 2020 which might be the reason why who does not recommend glucocorticoids for covid-19 treatment unless absolutely required ifn is a cytokine secreted by mammalian hosts during resistance to pathogens which can interfere with virus replication and enhance the antiviral ability of cells c e 2001 it is known that ifn can be divided into three types type i type ii and type iii chen et al 2020 type i ifn ifn- ifn- is also called viral ifn ifn- inhibits both rna and dna viruses but does not directly kill them c e 2001 ifn- can inhibit viral gene and protein synthesis by activating signaling pathways thus activates a variety of immune cells and improves the immunity while ifn- takes effect by inhibiting the adsorption of certain viruses enhancing phagocytosis of natural killer cells and mononuclear macrophages to viruses thus indirectly conducting the secretion of antiviral proteins in cells liu et al 2011 montoya et al 2002 ifn- can effectively inhibit the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro or in animal models and it has been used in combination with other antiviral drugs such as ribavirin to treat patients with sars-cov and mers-cov omrani et al 2014 an open-label randomized phase ii trial concluded that triple antiviral therapy with ifn -1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavirritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding and alleviating symptoms of covid-19 patients hung et al 2020 it was also stated that inhaled ifn- can be used as a trial treatment against covid-19 in the dtpncp the analysis of the peripheral blood samples of severe covid-19 patients indicated that severe lung injury caused by sars-cov-2 was associated with the levated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses pathogenic t-cells are rapidly activated by viruses and produce cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf and interleukin 6 il-6 which are two key inflammatory factors the progressive increase of il-6 has been regarded as a clinical warning indicator of disease deterioration alzghari and acuna 2020 fu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-il-6 receptor il-6r monoclonal antibody which can specifically bind to soluble and membrane-bound il-6 receptors and inhibit signal transduction mediated by il-6 thereby reducing inflammation and blocking cytokine storm caused by covid-19 scheinecker et al 2009 tocilizumab was initially used in a study of 21 chinese patients with severe covid-19 xu et al 2020a based on its encouraging therapeutic effect a multi-center large-scale clinical trial chictr2000029765 was further initiated and approximately 500 severe or critically ill patients were included in the dtpncp trial version 7 tocilizumab was recommended for the treatment of patients with extensive lung lesions or laboratory tests for elevated il-6 levels antinori et al 2020 in addition tocilizumab combined with other drugs has been applied in more than 20 countries including italy toniati et al 2020 the convalescent plasma donated by patients recovered from covd-19 contains a high titer of specific antibody to sars-cov-2 which may mediate a strong passive immunity against the virus cao and shi 2020 the plasma products have already been used in the treatment against influenza sars and ebola infection burnouf and radosevich 2003 van griensven et al 2016 zhou et al 2007 convalescent plasma was listed in the dtpncp since trial version 4 china national biotec group launched a research on the convalescent plasma for treatment of covid-19 since january 20 the results indicated that one dose 200 ml of convalescent plasma was well tolerated and patients who received plasma transfusion were improved in terms of several parameters including lymphocyte counts and c-reactive protein in addition no severe adverse effects were observed duan et al 2020 serological findings showed that the plasma from six donors recovered from covid-19 had high igg titers above 1320 and patients who received plasma transfusion showed no related adverse event and did not require mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion zhang et al 2020b though several cured cases have been reported more expanded clinical trials remains to be fufilled favipiravir avigan is a rdrp inhibitor with broad-spectrum anti-influenza activity furuta et al 2013 developed by toyama chemical industry and was conditionally licensed in japan in 2014 favipiravir can selectively inhibit rna polymerase related to the replication of the influenza virus and can be phosphoribosylated by host cell enzyme to produce bioactive favipiravir furylribo-5-triphosphate-inositol favipiravir rtp virus rna polymerase misrecognizes favipiravir rtp resulting in insertion of favipiravir rtp into the viral rna chain or its binding to the viral rna polymerase domain which hinders the replication and transcription of the rna chain of the virus furuta et al 2009 because of the specific mechanism favipiravir has an inhibitory effect on the ebola virus yellow fever virus norovirus and so on furuta et al 2009 oestereich et al 2014 rocha-pereira et al 2012 nowadays favipiravir has been used in the antiviral treatment of influenza a and b besides the drug-drug interactions and mechanisms of favipiravir against sars-cov-2 were also analyzed du and chen 2020 favipiravir showed a significant inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 in vitro ec50  6188 m wang et al 2020a on february 16th favipiravir was approved by the nmpa for the treatment of new or recurrent influenza in adults up to now there are 4 trials of favipiravir for covid-19 ongoing in china khambholja and asudani 2020 the preliminary result of a clinical study chictr2000029600 showed that favipiravir might relieve the progression of covid-19 by accelerating the virus clearance another open-label control study delclared that favipiravir showed significantly better therapeutic effects on the disease progression and viral clearance with an improvement rate of 9143 versus 6222 p  0004 in the chest imaging compared with lopinavirritonavir cai et al 2020 as a nucleotide analogue prodrug developed by gilead remdesivir can also inhibit rdrp with the same mechanism of action similar to that of favipiravir tchesnokov et al 2019 the structure of rdrp-remdesivir complex indicates that the partial double-stranded rna template is inserted into the central channel of rdrp where remdesivir is covalently incorporated into the primer strand at the first replicated base pair thus terminating the chain elongation yin et al 2020 once incorporated at position i the inhibitor causes rna synthesis arrest at position i3 gordon et al 2020 in addition the importance of the balance between incorporation and excision properties of nucleoside analogues between the rdrp and exonuclease also received increasing attention shannon et al 2020 in general remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral candidate drug with the potential against many viruses agostini et al 2018 de wit et al 2020 on january 31st the clinical symptoms of a patient infected with sars-cov-2 in the united states were significantly improved after treatment with remdesivir and the oxygen saturation recovered to 9496 holshue et al 2020 four days later it was reported that remdesivir had the strongest in vitro inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 among the six tested antiviral drugs ec50  077 m wang et al 2020a a phase  randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter clinical study lasting for 85 days and including 237 cases 158 to remdesivir with mild to moderate sars-cov-2 infection nct04257656 was conducted in china the results showed that the use of remdesivir was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement yet patients receiving remdesivir had a significantly faster clinical improvement with symptom duration of 10 days or less and the adverse events were reported in 66 compared to 64 of the placebo group wang et al 2020c morever the results of a phase trial revealed by gilead suggested that remdesivir had a better effect in the 10-day group remdesivir was also found to have a synergy effect with emetine and remdesivir at 625 m in combination with emetine at 0195 m may achieve 649 inhibition in viral yield choy et al 2020 based on these clinical findings usfda has made remdesivir available under an emergency-use authorization for the treatment of adults and children with severe covid-19 disease hendaus 2020 though remdesivir was considered as a promising option for covid-19 its safety and effect in humans still requires more evidence from additionalclinical trials li et al 2020 sivelestat sodium is the first drug to treat acute lung injury caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs developed by ono company in japan it was licensed in japan in april 2002 the low molecular weight enables sivelestat sodium to reach the gap between neutrophils and tissues and its enzyme inhibitory activity is not affected by reactive oxygen species which can effectively inhibit neutrophil elastase in the local site of inflammation aikawa and kawasaki 2014 sivelestat sodium can improve respiratory function shortens the time of using respirator reduces the complication rate of stress injury and respiratory infection caused by respirator installation and improves acute lung injury caused by sirs and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis iwata et al 2010 as early as mid-may 2003 nmpa approved the clinical study of sivelestat sodium for the treatment of acute lung injury caused by sars although the phase iii clinical trial of sivelestat sodium was completed in 2013 it has not been licensed in china aikawas research on the safety of sivelestat sodium in treating the acute lung injury showed no negative effect in the long-term treatment on march 12th sivelestat sodium was approved by nmpa cyhs2000102 for the acute lung injury with sirs and ards caused by covid-19 abundant studies on acute lung injury caused by highly pathogenic viruses such as influenza a virus and coronavirus have found that overactivation of complement especially c5a may be the central event in that processwang et al 2015 therefore c5a is highly valued as a rational target for the treatment of highly pathogenic virus-mediated acute lung injury bdb-001 is a monoclonal antibody targeting human c5a developed in china it can control the further development of inflammation without inhibiting immune function barratt-due et al 2013 it is expected to prevent the exacerbation of pneumonia in coronavirus infection and further reduce the incidence of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome bdb-001 injection has been approved by nmpa and is about to enter a phase 1-b clinical trial for the treatment of covid-19 based on several preclinical studies mesenchymal stem cell msc which has the characteristics of low immunogenicity and secretion of soluble factors to regulate immune response plays an important role in attenuating underlying acute lung injury monsel et al 2016 some induced pluripotent stem cells may serve as suitable infection models for drug screening ex vivo zhou et al 2020 in addition based on the similar pathogenesis and symptoms of h7n9 and covid-19 msc transplantation may be a way to improve the symptoms of severe patients with covid-19 j chen et al 2020 several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and effciacy of msc therapy for covid-19 studies showed that ace2- mscs could be beneficial for the patients with covid-19 pneumonia leng et al 2020 zhao 2020 due to the fact that castem human embryonic stem cell-derived m cells significantly improved the survival rate in ards mice model castem has been approved by nmpa to evaluate the safety and efficacy for severe covid-19 associated withwithout ards golchin et al 2020 kaviyarasi renu et al 2020 most of the promising drugs described above are small molecule drugs but biological products with specific targeting abilities and less side effects are gradually attracting interests the mechanisms underlying the therapies for covid-19 that have been approved for clinical use or are being evaluated in clinical trials include blocking viral replication regulation of immune function reducing inflammatory response and alleviating lung injurytable 1
 interfering with the normal replication of genetic material and blocking the formation of viral coat protein granules are two main strategies to block the viral replication reducing inflammatory response and alleviating injury can be achieved by inhibiting inflammatory factors or blocking the migration and other active responses of granulocytes while new use of old drugs is the most ideal strategy to identify effective drugs that can be translated to the clinical use immediately further clinical trials of old drugs to treat covid-19 are required since these drugs are not specifically developed based on the pathogenic mechanism of covid-19 in addition the strategy of new use of old drugs is not supposed to be a permanent solution for drug discovery to fight covid-19 rational drug design based on the pathomechanism of covid-19 and target protein structure of sars-cov-2 is suggested for discovering novel drugs against covid-19

  the epidemiology diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 pan zhai yanbing ding xia wu junke long yanjun zhong yiming li   there is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus covid-19 which originated from wuhan china and has now spread to 140 other countries including japan korea and italy the world health organization who declared that covid-19 has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans current evidence indicates that sars-cov-2 spread to humans via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the huanan seafood wholesale market phylogenetic analysis shows that sars-cov-2 is a new member of the coronaviridae family but is distinct from sars-cov identity of approximately 79 and mers-cov identity of approximately 50 12 knowing the origin of such a pathogen is critical to developing the means to block further transmission and vaccines 3 notably sars-cov-2 shares a high level of genetic similarity 963 with the bat coronavirus ratg13 which was obtained from bats in yunnan in 2013 however bats are not the immediate source of sars-cov-2 4 the typical symptoms of covid-19 are fever sore throat fatigue cough or dyspnea coupled with recent exposure as of march 16 2020 the outbreak of covid-19 generated 168 826 confirmed cases including 6503 deaths worldwide in china during the outbreak of the pandemic 42 000 doctors and nurses from all over the country supported wuhan moreover the government shared the updated genome sequence of covid-19 to the public and scientists from china and overseas are working closely and efficiently on this public health emergency 56 due to interventions and control measures from the government shutting down public transportation and implementing a treatment strategy and the change in personal behaviors wearing masks and reducing contact with others the number of confirmed and suspected cases in china has started to decrease however the transmission of pneumonia associated with sars-cov-2 has not yet been eliminated the covid-19 outbreak is still a major challenge for clinicians the aim of this article is to describe the epidemiology diagnosis isolation and treatment of covid-19 a study of early transmission dynamics of covid-19 revealed that the mean incubation period was 52 days 95 confidence interval ci 41-70 with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 125 days 7 a later study using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases showed a similar mean incubation period of 64 days 95 ci 56-77 8 an unusual case was also reported in which the incubation period was as long as 19 days 9 notably a long incubation time means adjustments in screening and control policies 10 the 19-day incubation period is a low probability event and experts suggest 14 days for quarantine the basic reproduction number is model-based largely depends on the epidemiological setting and is the most important parameter to determine intrinsic transmissibility the early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early stages of covid-19 the pandemic doubled in size every 74 days and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 22 7 another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 224 to 358 11 however a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 647 12 the authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts the basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 224 to 358 13 which is slightly higher than that of sars rapid and accurate detection of covid-19 is crucial to control outbreaks in the community and in hospitals 14 current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr realtime rt-pcr rrtpcr and reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification rtlamp 1516 rt-lamp has similar sensitivity to rrt-pcr is highly specific and is used to detect mers-cov 1718 according to current diagnostic criteria founded by the china national health commission laboratory examinations including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests have become a standard assessment for diagnosis of covid-19 infection to identify patients earlier two one-step quantitative rt-pcr qrt-pcr assays were developed to detect two different regions orf1b and n of the sars-cov-2 genome 19 three novel rt-pcr assays targeting the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrphelicase hel spike s and nucleocapsid n genes of sars-cov-2 were developed among the three novel assays the covid-19-rdrphel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro highly sensitive and specific assays may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 20 the sars-cov e gene assay was more sensitive than the rdrp gene assay combined with the one-step rt-pcr system 21 the e gene pcr was sufficient to diagnose a sars-cov-2 infection but the rdrp protocol was recommended to confirm a positive result 2223 the overall positive rate of rt-pcr detection of sars-cov-2 infection in 4880 cases from one hospital in wuhan was 38 24 the positive rate of pcr for oropharyngeal swabs is not very high only 533 of covid-19-confirmed patients had positive oral swabs tests 25 in a series of 51 patients with confirmed covid-19 infection 71 patients were rt-pcr positive at the first time of testing of throat swab or sputum samples 26 the rt-pcr results usually become positive after several days 2-8 days 27 automated solutions for molecular diagnostics can handle large numbers of samples and can be scaled to keep pace with fluctuating demand 28 29 30 the good analytical performance of a molecular assay for the detection of sars-cov-2 on a high-throughput platform the cobas 6800 was observed with minimal hands-on time while offering fast and reliable results 3132 the current laboratory test is time-consuming and a shortage of commercial kits delays diagnosis for patients suffering from fever sore throat fatigue coughing or dyspnea that is coupled with recent exposure covid-19 infection should be diagnosed with typical chest computerized tomography ct characteristics despite negative rt-pcr results 33 of 1014 patients 59 had positive rt-pcr results and 88 had positive chest ct scans 34 covid-19 belongs to the coronaviridae family therefore it is not surprising that covid-19 has imaging findings that are similar to those for sars-cov and mers-cov 35 typical ct findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution 33 eighty-six percent of patients showed ground-glass opacities or consolidation and more than one lobe 71 with bilateral involvement 76 was affected in the 21 initial chest ct scans 36 notably lung cavitation discrete pulmonary nodules pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy were absent 36 lung abnormalities on chest ct scan were most severe approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms 37 chest ct scans can be used to assess the severity of covid-19 covid-19 also manifests with chest ct imaging abnormalities in asymptomatic patients with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia 38 39 40 as the diagnostic criteria expanded from laboratory examination to chest ct imaging more than 14 000 patients were diagnosed on february 12 2020 classical public health measures including isolation quarantine social distancing and community containment can be used to curb the pandemic of this respiratory disease 41 china has been preparing since 2003 to contain future pandemics by applying lessons learned from sars 42 in the covid-19 pandemic china issued the largest quarantine in history all the residents living in mainland china were locked-in and city public transportation including buses trains ferries and airports were shutdown given the trajectory of this outbreak the chinese government scaled up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase in cases and geographical spread the wuhan government made full use of the gym and two convention centers and transformed them into makeshift hospitals with 3400 beds in only one night to isolate covid-19 patients from healthy controls more makeshift hospitals are under construction isolation beds were quickly expanded from only 137 at the beginning of the outbreak of covid-19 to 56 000 to separate infected patients from non-infected individuals the swift and decisive response of china contributed to reducing the control reproduction number and transmission risk due to the powerful and effective isolation measures taken by the chinese government the increase in covid-19 began to slow down on february 14 2020 according to the data released by the china national health commission there is no current evidence from randomized controlled trials rcts to recommend any specific anti-sars-cov-2 treatment for patients with a suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection lopinavir lpv inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus in vitro and in animal studies a retrospective matched-cohort study including 1052 sars patients showed that lpvritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduced death rate 23 vs 110 43 the protease inhibitor lpv is an effective treatment based on the experience accumulated from the sars and mers outbreaks indicating it is a potential treatment option for covid19 44 ribavirin a guanosine analogue is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections including respiratory syncytial virus hepatitis c virus and some viral hemorrhagic fevers promising results were obtained with ribavirin in a mers-cov rhesus macaque model 45 in addition sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp model is targeted by ribavirin after sequence analysis modeling and docking to build the model this feature increases its potential as an antiviral against sars-cov-2 46 the antiviral agent remdesivir was designed for the ebola virus disease 47 remdesivir shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several rna viruses and it may compete for rdrp 48 remdesivir and ifnb have superior antiviral activity to lpv and ritonavir in vitro 49 in a mouse model of sars-cov pathogenesis both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improved pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology 50 in a rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection prophylactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to inoculation and mers-cov did not induce clinical disease and did not replicate in respiratory tissues thus preventing the formation of lung lesions 51 in cell-based assays the triphosphate form of remdesivir incorporated at position i and rna chain termination was delayed which explained the high potency of remdesivir against rna 52 remdesivir was used to treat the first case of covid-19 infection in the united states the patients clinical condition improved after only one day of remdesivir treatment 53 a phase ii clinical trial of remdesivir was performed by the university of nebraska medical center and a phase iii clinical trial was performed by the china-japan friendship hospital the results of these clinical trials will be revealed in april 2020 remdesivir improved pulmonary function reduced lung viral loads and ameliorated severe lung pathology in contrast prophylactic lpvrtv-ifnb only slightly reduced viral loads and did not impact other disease parameters and therapeutic lpvrtv-ifnb improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology 49 overall these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than lpvrtv-ifnb 54 in a case report lopinavirritonavir kaletra and arbidol were associated with significant improvements in covid-19 patients 55 the efficacy and safety of these antiviral agents for covid-19 will be assessed in further clinical trials thirty-four trials of antiviral agents in patients with covid19 have been registered up to march 15 2020 table 1
 chloroquine is a widely-used antimalarial and autoimmune disease drug that has been reported to be a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug 56 57 58 chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov 59 the first results obtained from more than 100 patients showed the apparent efficacy of chloroquine in terms of reduction of exacerbation of pneumonia duration of symptoms and delay of viral clearance all in the absence of severe side effects 60 chloroquine was included in the recommendations for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 pneumonia 6061 the optimal dosage of chloroquine for sars-cov-2 will need to be assessed in future trials 62 hydroxychloroquine is a chloroquine analog for which there are fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions 63 in the previous sars outbreak hydroxychloroquine was reported to have anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 64 using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic pbpk models hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in sars-cov-2-infected vero cells 65 cytokines il-6 and il-10 have been reported to be increased in response to sars-cov-2 infection 6667 this may progress to a cytokine storm followed by multiorgan failure and death both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have immunomodulatory effects and can suppress the immune response 6869 therefore 21 clinical studies were launched by chinese hospitals and the university of oxford to evaluate the efficacy of these agents in covid-19 infection table 2
 it is also necessary to determine whether the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age of the patient and the clinical presentation or stage of the disease 70 if clinical data confirm the biological results chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be used in prophylaxis as well as curative treatment for individuals exposed to sars-cov-2 71 in a study of 41 covid-19 patients 21 received corticosteroids which could suppress lung inflammation 66 the administered dose of methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity current interim guidance from the who on the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when sars-cov-2 infection is suspected released january 28 2020 advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason the clinical outcomes of coronavirus and similar outbreaks do not support the use of corticosteroids in a retrospective observational study of 309 adults who were critically ill with mers patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation vasopressors and renal replacement therapy 72 for the management of sars corticosteroid treatment was more associated with psychosis diabetes and avascular necrosis 7374 overall there is no unique reason to expect that patients with covid-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids and such treatment may be harmful 75 however according to our clinical experience corticosteroids could be prescribed at the right time for the right patients the clinical trials involving corticosteroids are shown in table 3
 the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against covid-19 has important implications considering the relatively high identity of the receptor-binding domain rbd in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the cross-reactivity of anti-sars-cov antibodies with the covid-19 spike protein was assessed the spike protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies fortunately the sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody cr3022 binds potently with the covid-19 rbd 76 however other sars-cov rbd-directed antibodies 230 m396 and 80r cannot bind to the covid-19 rbd 77 cr3022 may be a potential therapeutic candidate alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 infections antibodies mab114 and regn-eb3 were designed for treatment of ebola virus infection and significantly reduce mortality from ebola virus disease 47 monoclonal antibodies can only recognize a single antigen epitope which limits the use of mab114 and regn-eb3 in the treatment of covid-19 however the development of covid-19-specific antibodies requires a long time it is not easy to apply monoclonal antibodies for new pathogens to clinical practice in a short time convalescent plasma was administered early after symptom onset in the treatment of sars and the pooled odds of mortality following treatment was reduced compared with placebo or no therapy odds ratio 025 78 however in ebola virus disease the transfusion of up to 500 ml of convalescent plasma in 84 patients was not associated with a significant improvement in survival 79 in a laboratory test the covid-19 virus was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient and it could be neutralized by sera from several patients 80 current clinical trials involving convalescent plasma transfusion are shown in table 4
 the national health commission of china appealed to convalescent patients to donate blood for the treatment of covid-19 infection convalescent plasma should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer the difficulty in obtaining plasma during convalescence limits its clinical application well-designed clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with covid-19 infection the structure of sars-cov-2 s protein has been revealed and this should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis 77 these findings provide the basis for further studies to optimize vaccination strategies for this emerging infection the majority of the vaccines being developed for coronaviruses target the spike glycoprotein or s protein 81 vaccine development is a long process and no vaccines are available at the time of a pandemic outbreak for example the ebola epidemic outbreak occurred in 2013 and three years later the rvsv ebola vaccine was selected for phase i clinical trials for its safety and immunogenicity in africa and europe 82 in november 2019 the european commission granted marketing authorization to merck sharp and dohme bv in europe for their ebola vaccine ervebo fortunately moderna company announced on february 24 2020 that the companys experimental mrna covid-19 vaccine known as mrna-1273 is ready for human testing it is a remarkably fast development cycle to develop an initial vaccine just weeks after identifying the sars-cov-2 genetic sequence the clinical trial of safety and immunogenicity of mrna-1273 in the treatment of covid-19 is under investigation clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04283461 moreover a new oral sars-cov-2 vaccine has been successfully developed at tianjin university which uses food-grade safe saccharomyces cerevisiae as a carrier and targets the s protein there are 18 biotechnology companies and universities in china working on sars-cov-2 vaccines vaccines for sars-cov-2 have been developed much faster than those for ebola because of the collaborative efforts of scientists around the world and the fast-track approval of sars-cov-2 vaccine development efforts by the chinese health organizations bats have been recognized as a natural reservoir and vectors of a variety of coronaviruses and these viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many different kinds of animals including avians rodents and chiropters 8384 while the origin of covid-19 is still being investigated covid-19 has features typical of the coronaviridae family and was classified in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage covid-19 can be transmitted between humans interventions including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the spread of covid-19 with the effect of travel restrictions wearing masks washing hands and disinfecting surfaces contribute to reducing the risk of infection human coronaviruses can be efficiently inactivated within 1 min using surface disinfection procedures with 62-71 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite 85 identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment control the pandemic and reduce the economic impact of covid-19 on china and the world in acute respiratory infection rt-pcr is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions the positive rate of pcr from oropharyngeal swabs is not very high in this situation more swab testing is needed to clarify diagnosis typical ct findings can help early screening of suspected cases and diagnosis of covid-19 the covid-19 infection has a clustering onset and is more likely to affect older males average age 51 years with comorbidities 86 no evidence supports adverse birth outcomes intrauterine infection or vertical transmission of covid-19 87 however viral infections can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during vaginal delivery or through postpartum breastfeeding 88 the most common symptoms were fever cough expectoration headache myalgia or fatigue diarrhea and hemoptysis 89 some people may experience severe acute respiratory distress syndrome histological examination of lung biopsy samples showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates 90 other organs are also susceptible to covid-19 the single-cell rna-seq data was used to analyse receptor ace2 expression to reveal the potential risk of different human organs to covid-19 infection 91 covid-19 uses the same cell entry receptor as sars-cov ace2 which regulates both cross-species and human-to-human transmissions 80 proximal tubular cells also express higher levels of the ace2 receptor which leads to susceptibility to covid-19 91 and induces kidney injury data from 33 patients with a complete clinical course were analysed and the levels of blood urea and creatinine were higher in non-survivors than in survivors 92 all patients with covid-19-infected pneumonia received antibacterial agents 90 received antiviral therapy and 45 received methylprednisolone 92 clinical trials are underway to investigate the efficacy of new antiviral drugs convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period is 1 to 11 months although the final results of these studies will take a long time to complete the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for therapy 93 the covid-19 pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern and all countries need a coordinated international effort to fight covid-19 the transmission of pneumonia associated with sars-cov-2 has not yet been eliminated in the absence of vaccines and antivirals isolation and quarantine are achieving remarkable results it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of covid-19 and to develop drugs and vaccines against the covid-19 infection as soon as possible  title what do we know about remdesivir drug interactions katherine yang   disseminated on an almost daily basis often with incomplete or conflicting results and without adequate peer review understandably while the focus of these investigations has centered on therapeutic efficacy attention should also be paid to the clinical pharmacology and potential for drug-drug interactions which is often lacking published data for the front-line clinician this information is vital to providing optimal care for covid-19 patients with complex underlying medical conditions receiving multiple medications remdesivir gs-5734 developed by gilead sciences inc has recently emerged as a promising new antiviral agent against sars-cov-2 initially developed to combat ebola remdesivir has been administered to over 1800 patients worldwide since january 2020 through clinical trials individual compassionate use and expanded access published reports of remdesivir have shown mixed efficacy 2 3 a case series of 53 hospitalized patients who received remdesivir via the compassionate use program showed an overall mortality of 13 with higher mortality 18 in patients who were mechanically ventilated a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial from china found no benefit of remdesivir compared to placebo however the study was terminated early due to failure to achieve its target enrollment and was therefore underpowered to show clinical benefit adverse events were similar in both studies ranging from 60-66 of patient receiving remdesivir compared with 64 patients receiving placebo serious adverse events occurred in 20-23 of patients notable adverse events include rash 8 and abnormal liver function tests 5-23 more promising preliminary results are emerging from the national institute of health adaptive covid-19 clinical trial actt which showed a statistically significant decrease in time to recovery defined as return to normal activity or hospital discharge the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compare with 15 days for patients receiving placebo p0001 while not statistically significant results did suggest a survival benefit with a mortality of 80 of patients in the remdesivir group compared to 116 of patients in the placebo group p0059 4 topline results from the open-label phase 3 simple trial showed that patients with severe covid-19 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved respectively allowing for once-daily dosing remdesivir has wide distribution to most tissues including the kidneys liver prostate gland and salivary gland but does not cross the blood-brain barrier metabolism is mediated predominantly by hydrolases with 74 and 18 of remdesivir recovered in urine and feces 10 11 the majority of remdesivir recovered in urine was metabolite this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved gs-441524 10 was recovered as remdesivir it is worth noting that remdesivir is formulated in sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin sbecd an excipient to enhance solubility sbecd has been shown to accumulate in moderate to severe renal dysfunction and in preclinical studies has resulted in renal vacuolation 12 caution should be exercised when co-administration with other parenteral medications formulated in sbecd eg voriconazole amiodarone particularly in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mlmin to date there are only limited in vitro transporter and enzyme-mediated drug interaction studies on remdesivir remdesivir is a substrate of multiple cytochrome p450 enzymes including cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 and is also a substrate of the organic anion transporting polypeptide oatp1b1 and p-glycoprotein p-gp remdesivir is also a weak inhibitor of cyp3a4 oatp1b1 oatp1b3 bile acid export pump bsep multidrug resistanceassociated protein 4 mrp4 and sodium-taurocholate cotransporter protein ntcp however metabolism of remdesivir is believed to be mediated predominantly via hydrolases and not cyp enzymes as noted above 11 due to the high extraction ratio of remdesivir hepatic clearance is likely driven by hepatic blood flow and not metabolic enzyme activity this in addition to the short plasma half-life and need for iv administration that avoids hepatic first pass metabolism likely results in a low potential for drug-drug interactions with the administered drug table 1 therapies 13 listed drugs include remdesivir lopinavirritonavir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine tocilizumab and favipravir among others according to the website accessed 4 may 2020 coadministration of strong cyp3a4 inhibitors such as voriconazole is labeled as no clinically significant interaction expected in contrast co-administration with strong cyp3a4 inducers such as rifampicin can lead to decreased remdesivir levels and it is recommended that these drugs should not be coadministered to add to the confusion three recent published reviews or guidelines of covid-19 therapeutics resulted in discordant conclusions regarding the significance and clinical management of potential cyp3a4 interactions mccreary et al correctly noted that the initial actt protocol erroneously stated that remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of cyp3a4 when in fact remdesivir is activated to the active metabolite gg-441524 via plasma carboxylesterases and metabolized by hydrolases 14 the authors concluded that while remdesivir is a substrate of multiple cyp isoforms drug interactions with cyp3a4 inhibitors or inducers were unlikely this is in contrast to a recent review of covid-19 pharmacologic therapeutics published in jama which states that while not a significant inducerinhibitor of cyp enzymes monitor with strong inducersinhibitors 15 on april 21 2020 the nih released their own covid-19 treatment guidelines 16 in their review the authors note that while remdesivir is unlikely to be affected by cyp enzymes or p-gp transporters remdesivir should not be administered with strong cyp or p-gp inducers but may be co-administered with strong cyp inhibitors the basis for this recommendation is unclear but is clearly aimed at minimizing the potential for subtherapeutic remdesivir levels while the impact of strong cyp inhibitors such as voriconazole is typically limited to the major isoenzyme cyp3a4 cyp inducers can affect multiple cyp isoenzymes and transporters leading to a larger cumulative decrease in substrate concentration when metabolized and transported via multiple pathways at present the contribution of each cyp isoenzyme and transporter to the overall metabolism of remdesivir and its metabolites is this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved unclear this approach also assumes that increased remdesivir levels and potentially increased levels of the active metabolite gs-441524 will not lead to increased toxicity which may or may   can vitamins andor supplements provide hope against coronavirus sarah michienzi m melissa badowski e   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the cause of coronavirus disease-19 covid-191 was first reported to the world health organization who on december 31 20192 and declared a global pandemic on march 11 20203 to date there are approximately 58 million confirmed cases and over 350000 deaths globally4 there are no food and drug administration5 or european medicines agency6 approved vaccines or medications for the treatment of covid-19 no specific therapies are recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention7 infectious diseases society of america8 society for critical care medicine9 or who10 outside of clinical trials the national institutes of health nih11 guideline was recently updated to recommend remdesivir in certain patients based on preliminary evidence from clinical trials despite absence of guideline-supported recommendations several therapies thought to be effective for covid-19 are in use around the world however access to these treatments is not equitable among all populations12 remdesivir and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine are drug therapies that have received the most attention remdesivir was initially available through individual compassionate use requests this pathway was halted for the majority of patients due to the overwhelming numbers of requests and the need to focus on clinical trials remdesivir access was then limited to these clinical trials and expanded access programs13 however not all patients had the equal opportunity to enroll due to study site locations and eligibility criteria1415 it was only on may 1 2020 that the fda granted emergency use authorization eua for remdesivir it is now available for suspected or confirmed disease in hospitalized adults and children with severe disease which is defined as low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation16 however allocation of remdesivir through eua has not been transparent and fears grow as healthcare providers are faced with rationing the limited drug supply1718 chloroquine and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine are widely prescribed for other indications however when reports emerged of their possible activity against sars-cov-2 shortages quickly developed in the united states us1921 these drugs can be obtained for covid-19 treatment through the fda eua but use is reserved for only the sickest patients in certain hospitals22 additionally chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with potentially severe cardiac side effects23 furthermore an early clinical trial failed to demonstrate efficacy24 another potential therapy showing promise is the 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg orally every 12 h ribavirin 400 mg orally every 12 h and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days when compared to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h this multicenter prospective open-label randomized phase 2 trial conducted at six sites in hong kong demonstrated that the triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir and ritonavir alone25 due to concerns over equitable access and adverse events of notable experimental treatments we aimed to investigate potential alternative agents for treatment of covid-19 that may have better availability and side effect profiles vitamins and essential nutrients are well known for their overall tolerability and requisite role in immune function thus they were a natural choice for our investigation this narrative review summarizes current and ongoing clinical trials of high-dose vitamins and supplements alone or in combination with each other or other therapies for the treatment of covid-19 while not the focus of this review vitamins and supplements may have an additional benefit in covid-19 prevention with a number of clinical trials planned to investigate this

this is followed by not yet recruiting n11 enrolling n1 and recruitment compete n1555783 although the full potential of vitamins and herbal supplements have not been elucidated various studies are underway to assess these agents as potential treatment options andor additive therapies to current treatment choices that vary around the world as there is no definitive treatment at this point in time depending on the formulation vitamins and herbal supplements are relatively affordable and accessible availability in certain markets may be limited as this novel virus has caused patients and providers to stockpile medications vitamins and supplements for later use without proven efficacy and unknown safety profiles at higher than normal doses leading to imposing limitations on the quantity that can be purchased84 although the use of remdesivir has been expanded in the united states its role in the fight of covid-19 has not provided patients and providers with the relief they expected although no difference in clinical outcomes was observed between 5 and 10 days of remdesivir treatment a study conducted in hubei china failed to demonstrate clinical improvements in adults with severe covid-19 in the remdesivir arm8586 interestingly time to clinical improvement in patients treated earlier was observed but needs confirmation in larger studies85 in an exploratory analysis the sponsor of remdesivir gilead sciences inc found that patients who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptoms onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms additionally when data were pooled across treatment arms by day 14 62 of patients treated early were discharged from the hospital compared to those who were treated late yet statistical analysis was not performed86 furthermore notable exclusion criteria in these moderate-to-severe covid-19 patients included mechanical ventilation at screening as well as patients receiving mechanical ventilation  5 days or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase  5 x upper limit of normal uln and creatinine clearance crcl  50 mlmin1415 therefore the true potential and efficacy of remdesivir therapy require expanded investigation into additional populations although doses of vitamins in these ongoing clinical trials are higher than normal use of vitamins at higher doses compared to recommended dietary allowance is safe and upper limits for the use are defined in addition the use of vitamins and herbal supplements likely has more benign side effects when compared to self-medicating with unproven remedies lacking adequate investigations for use in the instance of chloroquine phosphate and its derivative hydroxychloroquine a wife and husband ingested chloroquine phosphate in the united states in march 2020 after hearing from a press conference that this medication was likely a very promising treatment option the couple consumed hydroxychloroquine based on the intended use for their aquarium because they feared contracting the virus and it was easily accessible they were both hospitalized shorty after ingesting the product and the husband ultimately died87 meanwhile hundreds in iran died after drinking neat alcohol in early 2020 which was publicized on social media as a cureprevention for covid88 it is not clear how many of these deaths can be directly tied to social media misinformation as a larger problem of contaminated bootleg alcohol was revealed the most studied supplement in the acute care setting has been vitamin c where it has been used as treatment for multiple conditions including sepsis acute bronchitis cardiovascular disease postoperative infection and prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy a meta-analysis published in 2019 reviewed 18 trials to evaluate the effect of vitamin c on intensive care unit icu length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation the most commonly studied populations were patients undergoing cardiac surgery followed by sepsis lung contusions and burn patients of 12 trials containing 1766 patients intravenously administered vitamin c reduced the length of icu stay by 78 95 confidence interval ci 42112 p000003 orally administered vitamin c in doses of 13 gday was evaluated in 6 studies and was associated with reduced length of icu stay by 86 p0003 of the 3 studies evaluating patients requiring mechanical ventilation for 24 h vitamin c reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation by 182 95 ci 7727 p000189 these authors also performed a meta-regression analysis in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation and found that in 5 studies consisting of 471 patients vitamin c 16 gday was most beneficial in reducing ventilation time by an average of 25 p00001 in patients requiring more than 10 h of mechanical ventilation90 these findings can serve as a foundation for analyzing the role of vitamin c in potentially reducing the time spent on mechanical ventilation in patients with covid-19 vitamin c infusion for treatment in sepsis induced acute lung injury citris-ali a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted in 7 medical icus in the usa evaluated the effects of vitamin c infusion in 167 patients and its role in organ failure along with biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure patients were assigned to receive either an infusion of vitamin c 50 mgkg or placebo dextrose 5 in water every 6 h for 96 h although this study failed to improve organ dysfunction scores or alter markers of inflammation and vascular injury vitamin c was associated with a significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality as well as significantly increased icu-free days to day 28 and hospital-free days to day 6091 these findings also suggest that further research may be warranted to determine whether vitamin c has a role in the care of patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which has been associated with covid-19 vitamin d is currently under evaluation for its role in covid-19 for its immunomodulatory effects a trial conducted in guinea-bissau investigated vitamin d as supplementary treatment for tuberculosis in 365 patients the intervention was 100000 iu of cholecalciferol or placebo at inclusion and again at 5 and 8 months after the initiation of treatment findings from this study failed to demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes or mortality in patients receiving vitamin d as part of tuberculosis treatment but this may be due to the dose not being high enough or given consistently additional studies evaluating the role of vitamin d supplementation in the prevention and reduction of acute respiratory infections copd exacerbations and pneumonia were analyzed in the vitamin d3 supplementation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease vidico trial this trial investigated whether vitamin d3 supplementation would reduce the incidence of moderate or severe copd exacerbations and upper respiratory infections in 240 patients across clinics in london patients received six 2-month oral doses of 3 mg of vitamin d over a 1-year period vitamin d3 was associated with protective effects against moderate or severe copd exacerbations in participants with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations of less 50 nmoll p0021 but not in those with baseline concentrations  50 nmoll baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations had no effect on time to first upper respiratory infection92 a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 24 randomized controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin d in regard to incidence of acute respiratory tract infection protective effects were observed in subjects receiving daily or weekly vitamin d supplementation without additional bolus doses and were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels 25 nmoll serum 25ohd concentration was inversely associated with risk and severity of acute respiratory tract infection where for each 10 nmoll decrease in 25ohd concentration the odds of acute respiratory tract infection increased by 102 09710793 therefore some protective effects of vitamin d in those with lower baseline levels have been seen however the role of vitamin d for the treatment of acquired infections including covid-19 requires further investigation especially in subjects with low baseline levels of vitamin d this concept is currently under investigation in france94 when evaluating proposed studies of vitamins and supplements throughout the world there are notable limitations in currently available information such as standard of care while many of the studies report a comparator arm as standard of care there is no definition of what that actually means as there is no widely recognized treatment for covid-19 in addition much like other clinical trials key populations are excluded in many of these ongoing trials as well this includes women who are pregnant or lactating as well as patients with chronic diseases ie kidney disease or patients with short life expectancies ie cancers the greatest promise in combatting this life-threatening virus appears to be through reducing the cytokine storm associated with covid-1995 this is where anti-inflammatory and antioxidant vitamins and supplements may play a potential role results of these ongoing clinical trials are urgently needed at this time we recommend vitamins and supplements as specific covid-19 treatment in the context of a clinical trial this recommendation is in-line with the major organizational guidelines for potentially effective covid-19 treatments at the time of this writing while the vitamins and supplements under investigation for covid-19 described in this manuscript are generally without serious adverse effects and drug interactions no therapy is completely free of risk additionally while also being generally affordable broad recommendation and implementation of unproven treatments are likely not cost effective that being said vitamins and supplements with existing evidence supporting their use in conditions associated with covid-19 such as sepsis or ards can be considered when potential benefit is determined to outweigh risk with the rapidity of hypothetical treatments data being generated for covid-19 clinical investigations up until this point have not provided efficacious treatments in eradicating the virus while it is important to investigate treatments with the potential to reduce the severity and consequences of covid-19 vitamins and supplements should be continued to be evaluated to provide the much-needed evidence for possible treatment modalities a systematic review will be conducted once results from ongoing and recruiting clinical trials are available  pharmacologicaltreatment of covid-19 lights and shadows francesco menzella mirella biava chiara barbieri francesco livrieri nicola facciolongo   at the end of december 2019 a novel coronavirus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from wuhan hubei province to the whole country of china and then the entire world forcing the world health organization who to make the assessment that the coronavirus disease covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic the first ever caused by a coronavirus1 the coronaviridae family comprises pathogens that primarily target the human respiratory system of the other six coronaviruses known to infect humans two previously characterized as agents that are a great public health threat present with major symptoms severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and four present with mild symptoms hku1 nl63 oc43 and 229e2 coronaviruses covs order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae are enveloped viruses with a positive sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna genome based on genetic and antigenic criteria covs have been organized into three groups -covs -covs and -covs3 genome sequencing analysis attributed sars-cov-2 to the genus betacoronavirus within a subgenus sarbecovirus that includes sars-cov whereas mers-cov falls in a separate subgenus merbecovirus4 the origin of sars-cov-2 was explained with two possible scenarios natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer5 sars-cov-2 possesses the typical coronavirus structure with spike protein and other polyproteins nucleoproteins and membrane proteins such as rna polymerase 3-chymotrypsin-like protease papain-like protease helicase glycoprotein and accessory proteins6 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains the 394 glutamine residue in the receptor-binding domain region of sars-cov-2 which is recognized by the critical lysine 31 residue on the human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme ace2 receptor7 thus sars-cov-2 uses the same ace2 cell receptor and mechanism for entry into the host cell as sars-cov89 with a single n501t mutation in sars-cov-2s spike protein that may have significantly enhanced its binding affinity for ace27 infection with sars-cov-2 results in mild and nonspecific symptoms such as fever and cough common symptoms and nasal congestion fatigue loss of appetite and smell body ache and diarrhea noted in a small number of patients on the contrary severe cases might rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock and difficult-to-tackle metabolic acidosis and bleeding and coagulation dysfunction10 suspicions have risen regarding the possibility that an excessive immune response  the so-called cytokine storm  associated with macrophage activated syndrome mas may be driving covid-19-related ards11 specifically a cytokine profile resembling mas has been noted in covid-19 patients with increased interleukin il-1 il-2 il-6 il-17 il-8 tumor necrosis factor and cc motif chemokine ligand 212 current recommendations for the treatment of covid-19 severe cases consist of using existing approved therapies with proven safety profiles to address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality13 the aim of this review is to explore covid-19 treatment options and describe the potential benefits or disadvantages of their use in severe cases a search strategy based on validated keywords filters was devised to select articles regarding sars-cov-2 and related treatments in detail a selective search on pubmed was carried out up to april 2020 and research papers international guidelines case reports and meta-analyses have been considered the search strategy was based on the following keywords coronavirus sars-cov-2 pneumonia covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome antivirals corticosteroids biologics and anticoagulants a total of 136 potential papers were identified in the first search through pubmed and 72 of these were considered eligible for inclusion in this review by the authors because of the rapid developments in this area we have also added and cited any newsworthy reports as appropriate to date clinical evidence and guidelines based on reliable data and randomized clinical trials rcts for the treatment of covid-19 are lacking in the absence of definitive management protocols many treatments for covid-19 are currently being evaluated and tested worldwide table 1 some of these options were soon abandoned due to ineffectiveness14 while others have shown promising results1516 although it is still too early to have conclusive results especially from rigorous rcts the use of many drug classes is producing numerous data which are often contradictory it is extremely difficult to evaluate the results of clinical studies during a pandemic so far no therapy has been proven to be effective for treating the severe evolution of sars-cov-2 virus infection17 favipiravir a guanine analogue was able to block the rdrp of sars-cov and mers in vitro due to the high similarity of sars-cov-2 genome with sars-cov20 this treatment is considered a potential candidate for covid-19 even if in vitro efficacy on sars-cov-2 has not been tested yet21 favipiravir is now being assessed in rcts recruiting patients with covid-19 to evaluate its efficacy when combined with interferon- or baloxavir marboxil approved infv inhibitor chictr2000029548 remdesivir a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of rdrp is considered one of the most promising antivirals for the treatment of covid-19 this drug has a broad antiviral spectrum against hepatitis b virus and hiv and mers-cov and sars-cov both in vivo and in vitro2223 the safety profile also appears reassuring two trials on the efficacy of remdesivir on mild-to-moderate nct04252664 and severe nct04257656 covid-19 patients are currently ongoing in china these studies may provide very important data on the efficacy of remdesivir a recent work has shown that the antiviral activity of remdesivir begins immediately after the virus enters vero e6 cells carrying out its antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue15 this drugs acts as a competitor by incorporation with adenosine triphosphate to confuse viral rdrp evading proofreading from viral exoribonuclease and causing a decrease in viral rna production24 a trial on remdesivir was conducted by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases on a cohort of 1063 patients preliminary data showed a positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery and reducing mortality rate however the latter result was not statistically significant25 in a very recent randomized double-blind rct 237 patients with covid-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure were randomly assigned in a 21 ratio to intravenous remdesivir or placebo infusions for 10 days unfortunately also in this case remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical improvements26 even if the activity on sars-cov-2 is uncertain approved hiv protease inhibitors such as lopinavirritonavir were initially found to act on mers-cov and sars-cov and showed promising results in patients treated for sars2728 for these reasons the combination was initially widely used for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection with uncertain results a chinese study on a small cohort of patients demonstrated clinical effectiveness of lopinavirritonavir in combination with arbidol an antiviral drug usually used in china and russia for infv infection however this study did not show efficacy of lopinavirritonavir alone29 currently rcts for the efficacy of a combination of lopinavirritonavir with interferon- in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe-to-critical covid-19 chictr2000029387  chictr2000029308 are ongoing however the first randomized open-label controlled trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients with sars-cov-2 infection and respiratory failure unfortunately showed no benefit with lopinavirritonavir compared with standard of care30 neuraminidase inhibitors such as oral oseltamivir and intravenous peramivir have demonstrated significant clinical improvement in the treatment of patients with influenza in the past31 oseltamivir has recently been used for sars-cov-2 suspected and confirmed patients in china32 unfortunately to date no other data are available on their efficacy in covid-19 chloroquine sulfate and phosphate salts were both marketed as antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine has been widely used as an antimalarial and in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis ra these are drugs with a good safety profile with mild and transient side effects if correctly dosed in case of overdose or prolonged treatments they can cause cardiomyopathies and qt prolongation33 chloroquine has also been used in various chronic viral diseases in hiv infection no positive results emerged so the drug was not included in the recommended panel for the treatment of hiv34 the only viral infection in which hydroxychloroquine showed any efficacy was found in chronic hepatitis c especially if associated with interferon pegylated plus ribavirin35 interestingly wang and colleagues evaluated various antivirals and chloroquine in vitro concluding that this is highly effective in controlling sars-cov-2 replication15 some data indicate that chloroquine interferes with the ability of sars-cov-2 to acidify lysosomes moreover it inhibits cathepsins allowing the cleavage of the spike protein of sars-cov-236 in a recent study chloroquine phosphate was found to be superior to control in the treatment of covid-19 pneumonia improving clinical and imaging aspects and shortening the course of the disease37 in a nonrandomized clinical trial on a small group of patients a significant improvement in viral clearance was demonstrated furthermore the combination with azithromycin was significantly more effective for the reduction or disappearance of the viral load compared with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy38 on the contrary in a study with a small cohort of patients hospitalized for severe sars-cov-2 infection no strong antiviral activity or clinical efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was found39 the strong discrepancy of what emerged from the results of these studies highlights the fundamental need of rcts to assess the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of covid-19 conclusions from the published data are that there is currently no evidence of the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 the use should be limited to clinical studies to further clarify its role in the management of covid-1940 the evidence on the efficacy of corticosteroids is conflicting and the setting of application of these drugs needs further clarification in the absence of reliable data the who interim guidance on covid-19 management does not recommend their routine use41 furthermore according to version 7 of the national health commission of china guidelines corticosteroids should be used carefully in the case of sars-cov-2 infection42 in a recent study in patients with ards due to covid-19 a significant increase in survival was found in those who received methylprednisolone treatment p000343 in a retrospective study on a cohort of critically ill patients with sars-cov-1 appropriate use of corticosteroids was found to significantly reduce hospitalization mortality and duration44 all this without increasing superinfections and other important complications another study in intensive care unit patients treated with corticosteroids had no conclusions due to the small sample size10 corticosteroids associated with invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation should be considered to prevent progression to ards especially in severe patients45 the chinese thoracic society has defined an expert consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of covid-19 pneumonia46 according to this document corticosteroids should be used with caution in critically ill patients and the dosage should be low to moderate 051 mgkg per day of methylprednisolone or equivalent with a short course 7 days other authors argue that rcts are needed to obtain more precise indications on the correct use of these important drugs47 tocilizumab atlizumab is a humanized igg1k monoclonal antibody that targets the soluble or membrane il-6 receptors sil-6r and mil-6r this drug has so far been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as ra or large vessels vasculitis48 as for sars-cov-2 infection it is now known that the serum levels of inflammatory mediators are proportional to the severity of the clinical picture10 in these patients exaggerated immunological responses can trigger cytokine storms and cause damage to multiple organs the increase in il-6 levels can also be a sensitive biomarker of clinical worsening and serious organ damage tocilizumab can block two fundamental inflammatory factors il-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  thereby reducing the level of inflammation a multicenter rct to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of moderate patients at high risk of evolution toward serious and critical illness registration number chictr2000029765 was recently concluded results of this trial are not yet available however they are assumed to be positive in patients with elevated il-6 levels sarilumab is a fully human monoclonal igg1 antibody targeting soluble and membrane il-6 receptors

plasma or more commonly low molecular weight heparin lmwh is recommended in critically ill patients anticoagulant therapy is recommended if no contraindications are present recently new evidence has appeared on coagulopathies and the appearance of antiphospholipid antibodies with consequent multiple heart attacks in patients with sars-cov-2 infections55 large cohorts of severe covid-19 patients showed a high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism low molecular weight heparin therapy is related to a higher survival rate in patients with severe covid-1956 in light of these data it is even more important to reiterate the importance of anticoagulant therapy in severe covid-19 patients the concern about the possibility that drugs blocking the reninangiotensin system ras might increase the risk of developing a life-threatening sars-cov-2 infection could be due to the fact that the ace2 receptor allows the entry of coronavirus into cells57 however there are no data to support the possibility that ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs favor the entry of coronaviruses by increasing the expression of ace2 in humans ras dysfunction is present in patients with covid-19 but clinical outcomes of ras inhibitor therapy for example with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors or arbs are currently unknown and there is no evidence for their suspension in a retrospective study of 417 patients with covid-19 patients treated with an acei or arb had a better prognosis and lower levels of il-6 in peripheral blood58 in addition therapy with these drugs had increased cd3 and cd8 t-cell counts in peripheral blood and reduced viral load these data could indicate that the treatment with an acei or arb may have positive effects on a more favorable evolution of the covid-19 infection to assess more clearly the potential benefits of arbs such as valsartan or losartan on the evolution of covid-19 rcts are ongoing nct04335786 nct04335123 and nct04312009 only when the data of these studies are published it will be possible to define the potential benefits or the risks related to these treatments exploring and understanding the immunogenicity of covid-19 are essential for developing the most effective vaccine however evidence on the immunogenicity of sars-cov-2 is limited the genome of the sars-cov-2 is over 80 identical to the sars-like bat cov and studies on b-cells and t-cells epitopes have revealed high homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteins59 previously studies on sars-cov-1 vaccines revealed that the s protein on the surface of the virus is an ideal target for a vaccine as antibody responses directed against it showed promising results in protecting from infection in mouse models6061 moreover while b-cell response toward sars-cov gave limited protection over time62 t-cell response provided long-term protection even up to 11 years post-infection and are thus considered as a potential target for vaccines against coronaviruses63 research efforts are aimed at identifying the ideal sars-cov-2 epitopes against which directing vaccines is increasing many vaccines are currently under development table 2 following different strategies5864 whole virus vaccines are currently being investigated by companies such as johnson  johnson65 they have the advantage of eliciting a strong immune response through the stimulation of toll-like receptors however they require longer testing to guarantee safety66 furthermore subunit vaccines which rely on stimulating an immune response against the viral s-protein preventing its binding with the cell-receptor are already under investigation by companies such as novavax clover biopharmaceuticals and different consortia in the usa and australia6769 finally nucleic acids vaccines both based on deoxyribonucleic acid and rna platforms are being considered by biotech companies such as inovio pharmaceuticals and moderna therapeutics both at phase i stage nct04336410 and nct04283461 these latter formulations have not been successful in eliciting protective immunity in humans so far however expectations are high that this approach might eventually be successful70 at the moment treatment of covid-19 unfortunately has more shadows than lights the basic treatments are mainly represented by antiviral drugs such as remdesivir chloroquine or lopinavirritonavir even if the evidence for their use is not satisfactory among the antiviral agents the most promising appears to be remdesivir though this needs to be confirmed by ongoing rcts however many questions remain open about pathogenesis the molecular mechanism of input viral replication and immunological pathways in order to identify targeted therapies corticosteroids and tocilizumab seem to guarantee positive results in selected patients so far although the timing of starting therapy and the most appropriate therapeutic schemes remain to be clarified efficacy of the other drugs is still uncertain and they are currently used in combination and in variable ways in the absence of definitive guidelines what will represent the real solution to the enormous problem taking place worldwide is the identification of a safe and effective vaccine for which enormous efforts and investments are underway  the potential of drug repositioning as a short-term strategy for the control and treatment of covid-19 sars-cov-2 a systematic review william lima gustavo jlio brito csar joerg overhage waleska nizer stephanie   in late 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases reported in wuhan china was associated with a novel coronavirus initially called the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 1 posteriorly the sequence of the 2019-ncov genome revealed high similarity to sars-cov the causative agent of the epidemic of severe and acute respiratory syndrome sars between 2002 and 2003 in asia then the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv renamed 2019-ncov as sars-cov-2 and the world health organization who defined that this pathogen causes the coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 25 sars-cov-2 is responsible for a respiratory infection that can progress to severe pneumonia covid-19 has an estimated mortality rate of approximately 235 which increases with age and the presence of comorbidities eg hypertension cardiac insufficiency diabetes and asthma by april 15 2020 the novel coronavirus had affected 2033406 people and caused more than 130000 deaths worldwide 6 the public health calamity caused by covid-19 has led to the exhaustion of health systems worldwide forcing countries to adopt extreme measures such as the closure of their land borders and initiating social distancing policies to slow down the spread of the disease 7 currently laboratories and medical teams worldwide have focused on the repurposing of food and drug administration fda-approved drugs to treat the most severe cases of covid-19 since there are no specific chemotherapeutic agents to treat this infection 1 indeed drug repositioning might be a short-term alternative to fight this disease since the efficacy safety and toxicity of these drugs are already well known the initial phases of clinical trials could be skipped which would reduce the cost and duration of the process 8 in general drug repurposing is a cheaper faster and accessible way to make drugs available to the clinic 9 10 in this context several clinical and preclinical studies have searched for new pharmacological alternatives against covid-19 in clinically available drugs however current studies remain decentralized and no recent review has been able to summarize the available evidence of the anti-sars-cov-2 activity of these fda-approved drugs thus in this systematic review we aim to describe the drug repositioning strategy against sars-cov-2 and its clinical impact in the current context of the covid-19 pandemic we performed a systematic review according to the cochrane handbook 11 the search and selection of articles as well as extraction analysis and interpretation of data were conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma statement 12 pubmedmedline scopus cochrane library and biblioteca virtual de sade bvs were searched for articles investigating the antiviral activity of clinically available drugs published until march 23 2020 we aimed to select articles describing clinical and pre-clinical tests in vitro in vivo and in silico to include the largest amount of data in this review additionally we searched the clinicatrialgov website to identify ongoing trials with potential candidates for the drug repositioning strategy against sars-cov-2 indexed keywords from medical subject headings mesh were used to build search strategies the terms antiviral agents or drug repositioning or drug repurposing were combined with the keywords covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov by the use of boolean and between the terms as in the example drug repositioning and covid-19 all details about the search strategies can be found in the supplementary file to avoid losing any possible study the reference list of all included studies and relevant reviews regarding this topic were also screened two authors wgl and jcmb independently screened the databases and extracted relevant information following the prisma flowchart the degree of agreement between the evaluators was determined by the kappa coefficient performed with a 95 confidence interval 13 discrepancies about the relevance of the sources were resolved by a third researcher wscn finally all data of interest were summarized in tables tables 1 2 3 and 4 for further critical analysis and interpretation as shown in figure 1 we identified 33 articles during the initial search 30 from pubmedmedline two from biblioteca virtual de sade and one from scopus after the exclusion of repeated records and the selection of articles by the inclusion criteria fig 1 15 relevant studies were pre-selected of these 11 were excluded following the criteria described in figure 1 and four were selected for extraction of variables of interest 1417 the reference lists of included articles were analyzed and eight new studies were identified 1825 totaling 12 papers 1425 the degree of agreement between the two authors was considered substantial kappa  0825 13 all selected studies were published in 2020 and they describe a total of 57 drugs that showed some evidence of antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 fig 2 and tables 1 2 3 and 4 1425 as shown in figure 2a 22 different classes of drugs showed a potential therapeutic effect against covid-19 antivirals especially antiretrovirals were the most frequently studied class of therapeutic agents 30 1757 however the activity of antitumor 16 957 antimalarial 7 457 antibacterial 5 357 anticoagulant 35 257 anti-inflammatory 35 257 phosphodiesterase pde-inhibiting 35 257 anti-rheumatic 35 257 sedative-hypnotic 35 257 and anti-venous insufficiency 35 257 agents was also investigated other classes of drugs have also been studied against sars-cov-2 ie anthelmintic antiallergic antiemetic antiepileptic antifungal antihypertensive antipsychotic anti-hemolytic-uremic syndrome anti-angioedema lipid-lowering immunomodulatory and anti-pulmonary-hypertension drugs however only one agent of each class was evaluated 157 17 fig 2a most of the drugs with potential activity against covid-19 were identified by molecular docking 53 3057 fig 2b 2024 using the main protease 3clpro of sars-cov-2 as the molecular target table 3 moreover 39 2257 fig 2b of the drugs showed an anti-covid-19 effect in clinical trials table 4 and 10 of them showed evidence of action in clinical practice 10 657 1417 table 1 additionally 19 1157 18 19 fig 2b of the drugs studied showed antiviral activity in vitro for instance remdesivir showed the highest activity against sars-cov-2 inhibiting 50 of the virus at a concentration of 077 m 18 while ribavirin showed a less pronounced effect 10950 m 18 table 2 therefore the antiviral activity of only 27 compounds 47 2757 has been experimentally evaluated the remaining 30 reported drugs were identified only by theoretical methods in silico and need proof of antiviral efficacy in further studies table 3 regarding the clinical trials of new therapeutic options against covid-19 most drugs are in phase ii 36 822 or iii 27 622 table 4 only seven drugs chloroquine tetrandrine umifenovir arbidol carrimycin damageprevir lopinavirritonavir are in phase iv of clinical trials table 4 interestingly two of these agents in advanced clinical studies umifenovir arbidol and the association lopinavirritonavir have demonstrated previous evidence of action wang et al 14 reported that the use of arbidol in combination with lopinavirritonavir inhibits the aggravation of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 and promotes a virus-negative conversion in patients from china arbidol has also shown a potent in vitro effect against sars-cov-2 inhibiting the virus up to 60 times compared to the untreated control at concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 m 26 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 the causative agent of covid-19 has quickly become a threat to the public health and economy worldwide 7 27 recent clinical reports have shown that sars-cov-2 causes mild self-limiting respiratory tract illness as well as severe progressive pneumonia which can progress to multiorgan failure and death 1 despite the severity of some cases there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat this disease 1 therefore many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-sars-cov-2 activity of clinically available drugs 1 after the analysis of the selected studies we identified 57 molecules with potential antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 of these only six drugs lopinavirritonavir umifenovir arbidol remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown promising results in preclinical trials and have clinically lessened the symptoms of covid-19 since the other fda-approved drugs reported in this review showed weak activity against covid-19 we have chosen to discuss only the most promising molecules lopinavir and ritonavir are antiretrovirals widely used as a combination drug to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv infections lopinavir is an hiv type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor and ritonavir increases its plasma half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome p450 28 previous studies showed that lopinavir inhibits the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease which is involved in viral replication and is highly conserved among members of different viral species 29 lopinavir inhibited the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov in huh7 cells human liver strain in a dose-dependent manner with an ec50 of 80 m for both viruses 29 moreover lopinavirritonavir significantly reduced the mortality rate of mice infected with mers-cov suggesting a strong in vivo antiviral effect 30 little is known about the activity of lopinavirritonavir against sars-cov-2 and its effectiveness table 1 for instance wang et al 14 showed that the use of lopinavirritonavir considerably improved the clinical condition of patients with covid-19 however arbidol a broad-spectrum antiviral with activity against several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses eg influenza virus adenovirus avian coronavirus and hepatitis b and c viruses 31 was also administered to the patients n  4 the combination of lopinavirritonavir with arbidol makes it difficult to associate the observed antiviral effect to lopinavirritonavir or to its synergistic effect with arbidol in contrast mo et al 16 showed that the clinical improvement of patients with covid-19 was more associated with supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation than with the use of lopinavirritonavir likewise a study of 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection showed that the use of lopinavirritonavir does not increase the effectiveness of the standard treatment 15 these findings confirm that lopinavirritonavir has low clinical efficacy and is not a therapeutic option to treat covid-19 however the efficacy related to the use of these antiretrovirals as a combination therapy with other drugs should be elucidated in future studies arbidol umifenovir is an anti-influenza agent that has been used in china and russia for many years it interacts with the viral hemagglutinin ha and inhibits the fusion of the viral particle with the plasma membrane 32 this drug inhibited crucial stages of the sars-cov-2 replication cycle in vitro in a concentration ranging from 10 to 30 m 26 also a study has indicated that arbidol significantly lessened pneumonia associated with covid-19 14 these results have stimulated the initiation of clinical trials with this medicine table 4 for instance a chinese group of the ruijin hospital is currently conducting a phase iv study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol hydrochloride tablets in treating pneumonia in 380 patients with covid-19 clinicaltrialgov nct04260594 previous in vitro studies have indicated that arbidol shows significant activity against other coronaviruses herein a research group showed that this compound negatively affects the early stages of viral replication of sars-cov at a concentration of 50 gml this study also highlighted the stronger antiviral activity of arbidol mesylate compared to arbidol as an alkaline preparation 33 these preliminary results indicate that arbidol is a promising candidate for drug repositioning against sars-cov-2 however further studies are required to assess the difference in the effectiveness of arbidol and arbidol mesylate in patients with covid-19 remdesivir is a broad-spectrum prodrug developed to treat infections caused by ebola virus and marburg virus its active ingredient gs-441524 decreases the production of rna by interfering with viral rna polymerase and evading proofreading by viral exonuclease 34 recent studies have shown that remdesivir inhibits the replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in human lung cells 35 wang et al 18 showed that remdesivir has potent activity against sars-cov-2 in kidney cells with an ec50 of 077 m additionally this drug induced the clinical remission of the symptoms of covid-19 in the first reported case in the usa table 1 17 due to these promising results a phase iii clinical trial has evaluated the antiviral activity of remdesivir and its safety in patients with severe covid-19 this study is assessing the ability of remdesivir to normalize body temperature and oxygen saturation in 400 hospitalized adult patients clinicaltrialgov nct04292899 therefore the results of this clinical trial can guide the prescription of remdesivir as an anti-sars-cov-2 agent in the future chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial agents widely used to treat rheumatic diseases and have also shown promising activity against covid-19 36 the first evidence of their antiviral effect against coronavirus was reported in 2004 when keyaerts and collaborators showed that chloroquine inhibited the in vitro replication of sars-cov on vero cells e6 in this study chloroquine negatively affected sars-cov-2 at a concentration of 8 m 37 interestingly chloroquine inhibited the virus when the cells were treated with the drug before or after exposure to sars-cov suggesting prophylactic and therapeutic effects 38 this drug also affects the entry and replication of sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 113 m 18 moreover hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative of chloroquine is also able to inhibit the entry and replication of sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 451 m table 2 19 additionally the preclinical results have suggested that this antimalarial blocks the transport of sars-cov-2 from endosomes to endolysosomes which is a process required to release the viral genome 18 19 the promising in vitro results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have motivated the initiation of clinical studies of these substances table 4 one of these studies evaluates the prophylactic effect of the oral use of chloroquine in 10000 patients against sars-cov-2 clinicaltrialgov nct04303507 additionally several clinical trials have evaluated the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine clinicaltrialgov nct04318015 and nct04318444 its therapeutic use in monotherapy clinicaltrialgov nct04315896 or the effect of its combination with other antivirals clinicaltrialgov nct04303299 nct04321278 and nct0430127 and nct0430127 and nct0430127 against covid-19 the rapid popularization of these preliminary results has led to a massive and irrational demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in brazil for example after the first reports of the clinical effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 this drug quickly sold out in pharmacies which has compromised patients who use this drug continually to treat autoimmune diseases this irrational demand caused the agncia nacional de vigilncia sanitria anvisa to include these two drugs in the list of controlled substances to prevent their use to treat covid-19 without prescription or proof of effectiveness this situation highlights the importance of controlling the release of preliminary results especially in the panic scenario created by the pandemic although several studies have identified clinically available agents that are active against sars-cov-2 infections supportive therapy remains essential for instance mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation have been critical to the survival of patients with severe covid-19 mo et al 16 showed that that oxygen supplementation and noninvasive or invasive ventilation have generated similar results to the use of an antiretroviral with known in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 additionally wang et al 14 showed that the clinical recovery of patients with covid-19 is more associated with supportive therapies than with the use of antiviral agents however the identification of available drugs with anti-sars-cov-2 activity and their use in association with supportive therapies should be considered also the development of faster diagnostic tools to test for covid-19 might be crucial since some of the candidates for drug repositioning must be administered early in the course of infection thus better testing methodologies could lead to the early administration of drugs and improve the treatment of covid-19 the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 worldwide has put pressure on research centers to develop effective therapies and vaccines for the treatment of sars-cov-2 drug repositioning is a promising short-term strategy in the fight against the novel coronavirus however supportive measures are essential mainly for severe covid-19 patients and the implementation of drug repositioning should be done only if the efficacy of the drugs have been proven although lopinavirritonavir had low anti-sars-cov-2 activity arbidol remdesivir and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine showed promising effects against this coronavirus therefore the outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate the best treatment options for covid-19 furthermore additional studies of the antiviral activity of molecules that have shown a promising in silico effect may increase the therapeutic arsenal against the novel coronavirus  comment treatment strategies to fight the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 a challenge for a rubiks cube solver eliza

solidarity trial and soon after an add-on trial a european initiative of the reacting consortium the discovery trial was announced 12 currently there are no approved therapies specific for any human cov trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for other diseases have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses which cause sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers solidarity includes research looking at four possible therapeutics with direct antiviral actions remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine lopinavir plus ritonavir and lopinavir plus ritonavir and interferon-beta while chloroquine will not be included in the discovery trial additionally the discovery trial will include a placebo arm with standard of care while the solidarity trial will not be blinded and patients will know they received a treatment that would cause a placebo effect as stated by ana maria henao restrepo a medical officer at the who department of immunization vaccines and biologicals additional information regarding lung imaging and blood gases will be monitored in the discovery trial besides data on hospitalization length and requirement for oxygen or ventilation to be collected by the solidarity trial 3 sars-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the etiologic agent of the new lung disease covid-194 is closely related to sars-cov and together with mers-cov are three new human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years 5 the three viruses are associated with increased risk of acute lung injury 6 as of april 15 2020 more than 2 million people have been infected worldwide in 200 countries resulting in a death toll that surpasses 135000 people in this ongoing pandemic httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive sense single stranded non-segmented rna virus of the betacoronavirus family 7 remdesivir targets virus replication through inhibition of the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp required for the copying and synthesis of novel viral genomes and viral mrnas for the expression of viral proteins remdesivir incorporation in the nascent viral rna by the rdrp results in premature chain termination and because of the high conservation of the core rdrp enzyme among coronaviruses it has a broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy against multiple genetically distinct coronaviruses including the sars-cov and mers-cov in vitro and in vivo 8 furthermore it has shown prophylactic action against infection of corona viruses in animal models 8 notably remdesivir potently blocked sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index in vero e6 cells a monkey epithelial cell line ec50  077 m cc50 100 m si 12987 9 it should be noted that remdesivir resistance is already documented for sars-cov and other coronaviruses that lead to reduced viral inhibition 10 the outcomes in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 who were treated with remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis were recently reported by grein et al 11 fifty-three patients received 10-day course of remdesivir consisting of a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on day 1 plus 100 mg daily for the following 9 days improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 68 of patients and overall mortality was 13 over a median follow-up of 18 days although no data on viral dynamics were documented throughout the study clinical improvement was less frequent among patients receiving invasive ventilation than among those receiving noninvasive ventilation and among patients aged 70 years or older as compared with patients younger than 50 years chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative represent potential broad-spectrum example of inhibiting viral cell entry chloroquine is a weak base that becomes entrapped in membrane-enclosed low ph organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes and inhibits their acidification low ph in the endosomes regulates the action of proteases that lead to conformational changes of the virus envelope proteins allowing for the fusion of cellular and viral membranes and the escape of the viral genome into the cytosol attachment and entry of sars-cov-2 on host cells requires interaction of the spike protein subdomain 1 s with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and its proteolytic cleavage by tmprss2 and to a lesser degree by the acid activated cathepsin bl 12 although the exact mechanism of sars-cov-2 entry is not completely understood and a new study has suggested that ph-dependent fusion of viral and cellular membranes is dispensable for viral genome entry into host cells chloroquine similarly to remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index in vero e6 cells ec50  113 m cc50 100 m si 8850 9 chloroquine is also used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as sle and ra 13 although the precise mechanism of action is not documented inhibition of endosome acidification also interferes with innate immune response signaling from endosomal tlrs such as tlr 3 7 8 and 9 that mainly detect nucleic acid pamps and damps and in this way reduce inflammatory responses therefore chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may also protect the host from overt inflammatory responses driven by the activation of immune cells such as macrophages by the increased load of viral rna or cellular nucleic acids released from infected cells results from clinical trials using chloroquine have provided promising results despite the limitations of these studies and suggest that chloroquine may represent a line of defense in the protection of medical stuff and patients with increased risk for severe covid-19 symptoms chen et al 14 evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine hcq in the treatment of 62 patients with mild covid-19 from february 4 to 28 2020 at renmin hospital of wuhan university patients were randomized either in a control group receiving standard treatment or in the hcq group in which the patients received standard treatment plus hcq 200 mgbid between days 1 and 5 the study focused on time to clinical recovery ttcr clinical characteristics of patients and pulmonary recovery as it was depicted on chest ct results one day before day 0 and one day after day 6 a beneficial effect of hcq in the treatment of covid-19 was pointed out despite the small number of the cases more specifically body temperature recovery time and cough remission time were significantly reduced in the hcq treatment group moreover the study of the chest ct scans revealed larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the hcq group 806 compared with the control group 548 gautret et al 15 from france conducted a single arm protocol from early march to march 16 patients received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily azithromycin was added to the treatment regimen as the clinical presentation required and the control group was represented by untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol patientsviral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was evaluated on daily basis virus clearance at day-6 post-inclusion was the primary endpoint while virus clearance during the study period clinical parameters and occurrence of side-effects were considered secondary outcomes regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral load the study showed that a greater proportion of patients from the treated group had negative pcr results at days 3-6 post-inclusion compared with the control group interestingly at day 6 post-inclusion the percentage of negative pcr patients in the treated group was 70 while it was 125 in the control group p0001 the addition of azithromycin in the therapeutic regimen enhanced the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine more intensely patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were all 100 clear of virus at day 6 post-inclusion comparing with 571 in the group that was treated with hydroxychloroquine only and 125 in the control group p0001 the last two arms of solidarity and discovery trials include kaletra which is a combination of two antiviral drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - normally used to treat hiv lopinavir acts against the viral 3cl protease responsible for the cleavage of the viral structural proteins from a polypeptide chain in order to produce new virions lopinavir has modest antiviral activity against mers and is significantly less potent than remdesivir 16 however in combination with ritonavir and the antiviral immunomodulator interferon  it is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of mers 17 the efficacy and safety of oral lopinavir-ritonavir for sars-cov-2 infection was tested through a randomized controlled trial in china but found no benefit beyond standard care 18 kaletra with or without interferon 1 will be tested in the solidarity and discovery trials favipiravir brand name avigan is a type of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor which acts through blocking the replication of rna viruses and is a potential antiviral agent against sars-cov-219 a prospective multicenter open-label randomized superiority trial examined the efficacy of favipiravir n120 versus arbidol n120 for treating covid-1920 there was no difference in the 7-day clinical recovery rate primary endpoint for favipiravir versus arbidol in the overall population 6121 versus 5167 p014 however this difference existed for a subgroup of non-critical patients without hypertension or diabetes favipiravir 7143 versus arbidol 5586 p002 20 three registered clinical trials are planned regarding the use of favipiravir against covid-19 21-23 several promising theurapeutic options are emerging such as a protease inhibitor specific for tmprss2 cell protease required for virus entry 12 the broad spectrum orally bioavailable -d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 that is incorporated in the viral genome by the rdrp leading to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and viral inactivation 24 the four current regimens in solidarity and discovery focus on antiviral drugs rather than treating ards symptoms that are actually the cause of the virus morbidity and mortality hyperinflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 could be a driver of severity that may be managed with immunomodulatory therapeutic options 2526 low-dose corticosteroid therapy shock-reversal over no corticosteroid therapy is suggested for adults with covid-19 and refractory shock in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 and respiratory failure but without ards the routine use of systemic corticosteroids is not suggested however in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 and ards using systemic corticosteroids is suggested 27-29 importantly the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without the co-administration of azithromycin may not be beneficial for the treatment of critically ill patients admitted to the icu 30 and is not recommended 2731 immunomodulatory drugs such as tocilizumab actemra anti-il6 have been tested during the pandemic however great caution in inhibiting host antiviral responses should be taken 26 tocilizumab actemra is a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody currently used for rheumatoid arthritis 32 xu et al demonstrated that giving tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy to patients diagnosed as severe or critical covid-19 is an effective treatment 33 covacta is a newly initiated randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous actemraroactemra added to standard care in adult patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard care the primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status mortality mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu variables 34 finally the use of stem cell therapy to treat covid-19 is currently considered with multiple clinical trials from china registered at wwwclinicaltrialsgov 35 in a recently published clinical trial with a limited number of patients 7 patients 1 critically serious 4 serious and 2 common infected with the coronavirus received one dose of stem cell therapy with 3 patients in the control group 3 serious did not all patients with stem cell therapy recovered whereas in the control group one patient died while another patient developed ards and only one patient in the control group was stable 36 important considerations in the successful testing and use of currently available and future therapies for covid-19 are the timing of the treatment the viral load of the patient and markers predictive of lung injury antiviral treatment is more efficient as a prophylactic measure and at earlier times during the infection when virus replication is at its peak conversely immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory treatments may be more effective later and may be combined with careful monitoring of the patient viral loads the emergence of zoonotic human viruses causing pandemics are probably not going to be limited to the sars-cov-2 and represent enormous threats to global health pandemic preparedness in the future broad-based

severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which

sars-cov-2 patients elfiky 2020 r j khan et
al 2020 kumar et al 2019 repurposing
existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus
trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new
therapy rather than use the available resources elmezayen 2020 muralidharan 2020

to use computational approaches cameron et al 2013 to contribute to find an effective
treatment for sars-cov-2thereby computational analyses speed up these approaches since
they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously gupta et al 2020 molecular docking
includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel
relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their
direct physical interaction aanouz 2020 ekins
et al 2007 in present study we attend to
evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders irreversible interactions which
can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses and molecular dynamics
simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent
docking the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo
et al 2015 and some of the antiviral drugs
that can form a covalent bond to the target protein and we aim also here to redirect them
for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2
thence we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem httpspubchemncbinlmnihgov to identify the possibility of the
selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro where pubchem provides
detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories especially
the property of drug to form covalent bond before starting covalent docking we
downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep lim et
al 2020 based on the opls2005 force field
and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 elfiky 2020 s a khan et al2020 in the next step
the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro 6lu7 was downloaded from protein data bank httpwwwrcsborgpdb jin et al  2020 the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens removing water
molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module kumalo et
al 2015 in schrodinger suite 2020-1 the
covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available
in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a
covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently the different mechanisms for
the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1
based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and
receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms these
covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1
finally we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation
of the drug inside the binding pocket the chosen drugs binding energies were calculated using prime mmgbsa modules

level of biological systems which is hard to handle in labs shukla et al 2019 in the current study we conducted molecular
dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values the got protein-drug
complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations saquinavir
ritonavir and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro we hired gromacs 20181 to run 50 ns md
simulations abraham et al 2015 charmm 27
force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation bjelkmar et al 2010 we used swiss param to produce the
topologies of drugs zoete et al 2011 all
protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential
tip3p and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions in the following
step the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent
algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kjmolnm then the equilibration with position
restraint on the protein molecules for 01 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done
electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation darden et al
1993 we performed the molecular dynamics
simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability
in the final step time step of 0015 ns rmsd rmsf rg and number of hydrogen bonds
were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities the principal component analysis pca approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors
and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components
al-khafaji  taskin tok 2020a this
approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 20181 abraham et al 2015 it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic
motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that
are required for their biological function amadei et al 1993 we got the principal component analysis from the md
trajectories a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the
matrix we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2
d-projection of motion of trajectory what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir
has the highest binding affinity lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 7217 kcalmol
therefore the deep examination of saquinavir is needed figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 181  with
cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro in the
second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1
has 7202 kcalmol this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 182 
figure 4 through nucleophilic addition to
double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen
bonds despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 182  and three hydrogen
bonds figure 5 and this is similar to ritonavir
but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction
which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a
fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of
saquinavir ritonavir and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro we utilized
gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of
apo protein rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented
the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics stability and convergence of the
various systems and the results are presented in figure
6a figure 6a shows there is a significant decrease
in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir ritonavir
or remedisivir further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main
protease was 0294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir ritonavir and remedisivir the rmsd
averages were01865 02130 and 02053 nm respectively another significant aspect of md
simulation is the flexibility of proteins backbone which can be assessed through
measuring rmsf value the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and
their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6b closer scrutiny of figure 6b exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of
the proteins backbone and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6b where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led
to reducing the flexibility of the protein the radius of gyration rg is a definition of
systems density and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins
rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes in this work rg values are in
agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and
hollo forms as presented in figure 6c this
reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time the number of
intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability
of drug and protein also the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores
of molecular docking process we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the
stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target as seen in the
figure 6d the ritonavir has highest order of
hydrogen bonding the average 335 while saquinavir has an average of 168 the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of
sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir ritonavir and remedisivir basically
the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference
in order to further understand the configurational space we selected the first two
principal components pc1 pc2 to analyze their projection of trajectories during the
simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space shown in
figure 7 during the four system simulations
the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase
space while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space
especially saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional
motions as compared with another drugs moreover the pca results suggest that the
drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of
sars-cov-2 mpro in short the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf
results which enhance the validity of the performed analysis sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can
infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug
treatment available prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking
to determine effective treatment in short time wu et al 2020 in reviewing the literature we took the advantage of
possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the
sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 an initial objective of the project was to identify effective
and applicable treatment the present study focused on the main protease mpro especially
pdb id 6lu7 as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic
option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine
145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease the mpro in
sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein
to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein the
most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity
binding energy mmgbsa  72 kcalmol to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible
interactions this study supports evidence from previous observations that
lopinavirritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 lim et al 2020 another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with
binding affinity mmgbsa  65 kcalmol  whereas previous research has established that
remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results another significant
finding delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond
of 5765 kcalmol mmgbsa binding energy moreover indinavir and cefuroxime axetil
exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable
interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding mmgbsa binding energies  54
kcalmol furthermore oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with
sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond  51 kcalmol which
is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir peeri et al 2020 in this study results obtained show the binding affinity of
drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form
a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro cys145 and length of a covalent bond
the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of
nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds in this concept the structural features in
saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group -nh2 hydroxyl groups -oh carbonyl
groups co in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond results
show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hivaids
more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind
covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding as discussed above
saquinavir ritonavir remdesivir delavirdine cefuroxime axetil oseltamivir and prevacid
showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and
stabilized with hydrogen bonding these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi 2020 they found that
ribavirin telbivudine vitamin b12 and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding
interactions whilst our results showed that saquinavir ritonavir and remdesivir can form
irreversible interactions which are considered an effective way for viral infections in the present work comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate
the effects of saquinavir ritonavir and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical
demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic
level an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid effective safe and
available for large proportions of people so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the
possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions therefore we had chosen these
drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target but the
docking results are not adequate so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are
able to form stable interactions with targeted protein one interesting finding is the rmsd
of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value whereas the binding with top
three drugs diminished these rmsd average another important finding was that the rmsf of
proteins backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main
protease it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg
values it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the
targeted protein thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md
trajectories to judge without dispute the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca
analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential
dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions these
results seem to be consistent with rmsd results a possible explanation for this might be
that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this
makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological
functions it is possible therefore that using these available drugs in two ways either
alone or in combined way these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against
sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening also the present
results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop
development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be
efficient treatment coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide although
extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 but till now there is no
medication meanwhile the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to
overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 the aim of the present study was
to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs
against sars-cov-2 mpro where they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening the
most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder
toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked saquinavir  ritonavir  remdesivir  delavirdine
 cefuroxime axetil  oseltamivir  prevacid one of the more noteworthy findings in
this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir ritonavir and remdesivir can
form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro also they restricted
the essential motions of protein overall the results of screening toward mpret encourage
for further clinical evaluations they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive

in vitro studies suggest that chloroquine may be more potent at inhibiting sars-cov-2 than hydroxychloroquine but hydroxychloroquine seems to be less toxic16 hydroxychloroquine is administered orally in a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days17 electrocardiogram ecg monitoring is recommended to watch for cardiac arrhythmias including qt prolongation torsade de pointe and atrioventricular block8 a reduction in the dose or discontinuation should be considered with qtc 500 ms or an increase in qtc 60 ms and caution is advised if used together with other therapies that prolong qtc especially antiarrhythmics an antimalarial-induced hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy can also occur but this is exceedingly rare and occurs with prolonged use which is not a concern given the short duration 5 days of treatment required for covid-1918 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also inhibit cyp2d6 which may increase beta-blocker exposure and risk of bradycardia pr interval prolongation and atrioventricular block other potential adverse effects include severe hypoglycemia erythroderma hematological and psychiatric disturbances thus routine monitoring should include a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel a small pilot study19 randomized 30 patients to either the intervention hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily for 5 days or conventional therapy only on day 7 patients were tested through respiratory pharyngeal swab for evidence of covid-19 nucleic acid there was no difference in the number of negative swabs between the hydroxychloroquine n  13 and control n  14 groups p  005 no favorable trends were observed in other secondary measures including duration of hospitalization body temperature regulation or radiological progression in another small single-arm study the effects of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily in hospitalized patients on the presence or absence of virus at day 6 were studied20 twenty-six french subjects received the protocol and 16 served as controls six stopped hydroxychloroquine therapy early due to either being transferred to the intensive care unit n  3 leaving the hospital n  1 death n  1 or nausea n  1 on day 6 of treatment 70 of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured compared with only 125 in the control group p  0001 the addition of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective for virus elimination with a 100 cure rate suggesting this combination may be superior to hydroxychloroquine alone the same authors have published a preprint21 of a larger sample n  80 of patients who received the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin showing clinical improvement in all but 2 patients the authors report that only 15 of subjects required oxygen therapy 93 had a negative nasopharyngeal viral load on day 8 and the length of stay was limited to an average of 5 days despite the favorable outcomes reported in these observational studies a proper randomized controlled trial is warranted before any definitive decisions can be made regarding the role of these therapies in treating covid-19 although the mechanism of how azithromycin would be effective in patients with covid-19 azithromycin has been found to have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in both in vivo and in vitro studies202223 azithromycin also has activity against proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il-6 and il-8 which may reduce the development of cytokine storm but this warrants further study22 one potential concern however with concomitant antimalarial therapy with azithromycin is the potential for qtc prolongation warranting daily ecg monitoring24 although other macrolides have demonstrated similar effects azithromycin minimally inhibits cyp3a4 while others eg erythromycin and clarithromycin are strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 and not as well tolerated as azithromycin at this time the data supporting the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for covid-19 are very limited given the potential for significant toxicity use of this regimen should be considered with caution some have also suggested there may be a role for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to be used for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals such as health care workers therefore chloroquine is being studied as a potential preventative measure against covid-19 in health care workers and other individuals in high-risk environments nct04303507 participants will be randomized to placebo or chloroquine loading dose of 10 mgkg followed by 150 mg daily for 3 months the primary outcome will be the number of covid-19 cases at 100 days at this time however there is little evidence for pharmacological measures to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 in health care workers or other high-risk individuals remdesivir gilead sciences inc foster city ca is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity initially used against ebola25 in vivo and in vitro testing has shown to inhibit human coronavirus replication including sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov152627 remdesivir was initially only available for compassionate use but received orphan drug status from the us food and drug administration fda on march 23 2020 the recommended dosing is an initial single dose of 200 mg intravenously followed by 100 mg every 24 hours for the duration of the hospitalization up to 10 days25 several phase 3 clinical trials are underway in the united states south korea china and europe nct04302766 nct04280705 nct04292899 nct04292730 2020-000936-23 two of the larger ongoing multicenter clinical trials nct04292899 nct04292730 are evaluating remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate n  600 or severe n  400 symptoms not yet requiring mechanical ventilation patients in these studies are randomized to 5 or 10 days of remdesivir or to an additional standard of care arm in the moderate disease trial with a focus on discharge fever and oxygen saturation at 14 days patients with more severe symptoms requiring mechanical ventilation must pursue individual compassionate use protocols in to receive access to remdesivir importantly these trials have no cardiovascular-specific reasons for exclusion overall remdesivir is generally well tolerated but self-limiting hepatotoxicity has been observed nephrotoxicity is also possible thus its use is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 mlmin173 m2 or those on dialysis monitoring recommendations include a complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel there is limited information available at this time regarding the potential for drugdrug interactions with remdesivir information from a clinical trial protocol nct04280705 suggests that remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of cyp3a4 and remdesivir is a substrate for cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 in vitro yet it also states that coadministration with drugs that affect these cyp isoforms is unlikely to significantly affect the metabolism of remdesivir lopinavir is a protease inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of hiv that is combined with ritonavir and another protease inhibitor that also inhibits cyp3a4 and is combined with lopinavir to enhance its potency28 from a cardiovascular perspective lopinavirritonavir does not induce endothelial dysfunction or insulin resistance however it can cause hypertriglyceridemia2930 a retrospective single-center study suggests that ritonavir-boosted regimens may worsen cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hiv and heart failure31 importantly these data are not sufficient to restrict the use of lopinavirritonavir in patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure given the life-threatening potential of covid-19 and short-term 2 weeks duration of treatment there are notable drugdrug interactions with lopinavirritonavir and select cardiovascular therapies because ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 and p-glycoprotein mdr132 this may result in increased concentrations of cardiovascular therapies metabolized through cyp3a4 such as rivaroxaban apixaban simvastatin and lovastatin all of which should not be used in combination with ritonavir3334 likewise ritonavir inhibits the bioactivation of clopidogrel and prasugrel which may decrease antiplatelet activity however this may not affect the antiplatelet activity of prasugrel making it still a reasonable option3536 ticagrelor should not be used with strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ritonavir due to an increased risk of bleeding3536 the use of p2y12 platelet function assays may be appropriate to ensure adequate antiplatelet activity gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting and diarrhea and elevations in hepatic transaminases can also occur routine monitoring includes complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel and a baseline ecg is recommended when used with concomitant agents eg antiarrhythmics that prolong the qt interval recently 199 hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 disease were randomized to either a fixed dose of lopinavirritonavir 400 and 100 mg respectively twice daily for 14 days or standard of care28 the intervention did not improve time to clinical improvement or mortality although the study was underpowered to detect a mortality benefit gastrointestinal complaints nausea vomiting and diarrhea were also common and 138 of patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events additional clinical trials are ongoing including one clinical trial comparing lopinavirritonavir with hydroxychloroquine nct04307693 and another clinical trial comparing lopinavirritonavir with remdesivir 2020-000936-23 in patients with covid-19 of note interferon-beta may also be used in combination with lopinavirritonavir which has been shown to improve pulmonary function and reduce viral loads in marmosets and mice with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus but this has not yet been evaluated in humans2637 patients with severe infection may progress to severe respiratory failure due to ards mediated by a catastrophic inflammatory cascade3839 early observations in china and italy led to widespread use of tocilizumab a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor il-6r4041 although originally fda approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis tocilizumab is routinely used in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome secondary to chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapy in hematologic malignancies42 an observational series of patients with severe respiratory symptoms in china showed recovery in 1921 91 after treatment with tocilizumab 4 mgkg iv maximum dose of 400 mg43 other emerging treatment protocols recommend more aggressive doses 8 mgkg up to 800 mg and repeated doses at 12 and 24 hours for patients showing inadequate responses the primary risks of tocilizumab relate to immunosuppression through neutropenia and interruption of t-cell-mediated immunity infusion reactions and transient transaminase elevations may also occur frequently although tocilizumab significantly increases cholesterol levels and blood pressure a recent network meta-analysis found the cardiovascular risk with tocilizumab was comparable with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs44 regardless given the high mortality rate among patients with covid-19mediated ards 50 the potential benefits of short-term tocilizumab use seem to outweigh risks of treatment for most patients the parallels in inflammatory pathophysiology between chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapymediated cytokine release syndrome and covid-19mediated ards suggest that il-6 suppression is a key advancement in treatment of severe covid-19 infection sarilumab regeneron pharmaceuticals inc tarrytown ny is the only other il-6 blocker currently on the market if tocilizumab is unavailable however there is limited evidence to guide the selection and dosing of these agents at this time an urgent public health priority to combat covid-19 in the future is to develop a safe and effective vaccine widespread vaccination could also play a role in modulating the cardiovascular risk similar to what has been observed with influenza thus the importance of identifying a safe and effective vaccine45 the first phase 1 clinical trial nct04283461 evaluating a vaccine for covid-19 mrna-1273 began on march 19 2020 and is being sponsored by the national institutes of health the open-label study will enroll 45 healthy adults between 18 and 55 years over 6 weeks although 40 vaccine candidates are in the pipeline it is unlikely a vaccine will be available until at least 2021 there has been increased concern regarding the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in patients with covid-1946 this is due to the potential of ace inhibitors and arbs to upregulate ace2 receptors which are found in vascular endothelial cells of the heart kidneys and lungs and have been shown to be the host cell entry point for sars-cov-247 thus there is a theoretical increased risk for covid-19 in patients taking these medications it also seems that sars-cov-2 consumes ace2 and increases angiotensin2 at2 activity which activates an inflammatory response resulting in microvascular constriction and ischemic injury48 moreover the sars-cov led to downregulation of ace2 and more severe lung injury in mice which could theoretically be attenuated by administration of an arb49 mice lacking ace2 have also been shown to have worse outcomes with influenza h7n9 infection50 observational evidence suggests that ace inhibitors but not arbs may reduce the risk of pneumonia51 given the limited data available supporting either harm or benefit multiple professional organizations have released statements to provide guidance a joint statement from the heart failure society of america american heart association and american college of cardiology recommends not to add or remove any raas-related treatments beyond actions based on standard clinical practice and calls for further research in this area52 likewise the council on hypertension of the european society of cardiology also released a position statement recommending physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with acei or arbs should be discontinued because of the covid-19 infection53 to help determine the potential role or harm of ace inhibitors and arbs 2 randomized multicenter clinical trials are underway patients with a presumptive positive test for covid-19 who require hospitalization and are not already taking an ace inhibitor or arb will be randomized to either losartan 25 mg daily or placebo nct04312009 the primary outcome of this study is the sequential organ failure assessment respiratory score which is used to determine the risk of mortality from respiratory failure a similarly designed study nct04311177 will compare losartan 25 mg daily to placebo in patients who test positive for covid-19 but do not require hospitalization the primary outcome of this study will be hospitalization rates at 28 days in addition to ace inhibitors and arbs ibuprofen was purported in a recent correspondence to also increase ace2 and potentially the risk of worsening covid-1946 despite no definitive evidence supporting this claim it was promoted by the french health minister on social media54 although the world health organization originally backed the claim they later retracted that advice and now do not recommend against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid use55 the european medicines agency56 and fda57 have also confirmed the lack of evidence to support a link between nsaids and worsening covid-19 regardless nsaids should still be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease especially those with heart failure and renal disease because they can increase bp and cause fluid retention it is well established that statins have vascular and myocardial anti-inflammatory effects which may exert some potential benefit in patients with acute viral respiratory infections58 observational studies have reported an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes and even mortality in statin-treated patients with influenza or pneumonia however a healthy user bias could be a contributing factor to these findings5960 the randomized controlled trial data are very limited and has found conflicted results6162 importantly there has been no reported harm associated with statin use in these patients which supports the continued use of statins in patients with an indication for statin therapy such as those with established cardiovascular disease diabetes or other high-risk features this is particularly true given the higher mortality rates observed in covid-19 patients with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic comorbidities as previously discussed however dose reductions or therapy substitutions may be warranted if patients receive lopinavirritonavir treatment while on statin therapy table 1 in rare instances patients with covid-19 may develop rhabdomyolysis or acute liver injury which would require prompt statin discontinuation the spectrum of covid-19 disease ranges from mild to severe and it has been well described elsewhere8 patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease are at particular high risk of severe illness and mortality9 myocardial injury as witnessed by elevation in troponin levels is common in patients with covid-193863 and is likely to reflect demandsupply mismatch type ii myocardial infarction or septic cardiomyopathy for which no specific therapy is recommended other than attempting to optimize oxygen supply delivery and demand as much as possible by intervening on the pulmonary hematologic cardiac and vascular systems increased troponin i identifies patients with severe covid-19 and is associated with very high mortality but whether myocardial injury reflects a specific pathologic mechanism of disease or a subgroup of patients with more severe disease is unclear64 anecdotal cases of myocarditis have been reported6566 but they seem to be rare an elevation in d-dimer levels38 suggests an activation of the coagulation cascade in patients with covid-19 however an increase in thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been widely reported regardless anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin in patients with markedly elevated d-dimer levels should be considered although precise recommendations are challenging given the lack of evidence recently the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis released a pragmatic statement recommending clinicians measure d-dimers prothrombin time and platelet count in all patients with covid-1967 furthermore they also recommend a prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin in all patients including those who are not critically ill barring any contraindications additional study is warranted to understand the anticoagulation needs of patients with covid-19 for patients with covid-19 who experience an acute coronary syndrome access to emergency coronary angiography can become restricted in some instances and fibrinolysis can become first-line therapy for lower risk st-segment elevation patients to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of the infection across different areas of the hospital hospitals should also develop protocols for st-segment elevation management for patients with covid-19 in collaboration with their infection prevention departments to optimize patient management while reducing the risk for patient and health care worker transmission in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction a careful review of medical treatments should be considered in case of the initiation of the aforementioned investigational drugs to treat covid-19 when possible guideline-directed medical therapy should be continued but additional monitoring is warranted lopinavirritonavir may only modestly affect ace inhibitors and arbs while sacubitrilvalsartan levels can increase warranting close monitoring of bp lopinavirritonavir can increase levels of beta-blockers warranting ecg monitoring and potentially dose downtitration while hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may reduce levels of beta-blocker and require a dose uptitration68 among mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists spironolactone can be safely used with lopinavirritonavir whereas eplerenone which is mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 should not be coadministered for the same reason coadministration of ivabradine and lopinavirritonavir should be avoided digoxin levels should be followed closely in patients on lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine limited contact with others to minimize the spread of sars-cov-2 during the epidemic phase of the disease is advised this usually implies rescheduling routine follow-up visits options include the use of telehealth to conduct brief focused remote visits or postponement of visits for more stable patients regardless there are some additional considerations for managing these patients home blood pressure monitoring devices weight scales heart failure telemonitoring and other remote equipment should be offered when possible to augment telehealth visits such equipment may require training of the patients and health care providers but also may reveal unequal access to such resources reinforcing heart healthy lifestyle and stress management are also important given the inherent impact of social distancing and quarantine during a pandemic on daily routines and mental health additional medication-related considerations include ensuring patients have sufficient refills and prescribing a longer supply for maintenance medications these represent some of the potential challenges of social isolation during the pandemic in closing sars-cov-2 is a novel virus that has spread rapidly throughout the world causing a potentially life-threatening disease covid-19 causing disproportionally high mortality among elder patients with concomitant pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases although no approved therapies currently exist multiple collaborative efforts are underway to identify effective therapies and a vaccine to prevent future infection cardiovascular clinicians however may not be accustomed to the concomitant use of antivirals and immunomodulators in their patients thus the need to understand how these therapies might impact underlying cardiovascular conditions and medications despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 there is an immense opportunity to enhance our understanding of how to prevent and treat such emerging infections as well as improve our understanding of the relationship between infection immune response and cardiovascular disease  clinical perspective on 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia a systematic review of published case reports alexander muacevic john adler r rikinkumar patel s neev patel mizba baksh annam zaidi jaiminkumar patel   the ongoing outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has posed significant threats to international health and the economy 1 in late december 2019 a cluster of patients were admitted to hospitals with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia of an unknown etiology these patients were epidemiologically linked to the seafood and wet animal wholesale market in wuhan hubei province china 2 analysis of the viral genome has revealed that the new coronavirus cov is phylogenetically close to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the causative agent of a viral outbreak in 2002 thus the new cov has been named sars-cov type 2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv and other virologists 3 on february 11 2020 the world health organization who director-general announced that the disease caused by this new cov was called as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 this new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally on march 11 2020 as the number of 2019-ncov cases outside china has increased 13 times and the number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118000 cases in 114 countries and over 4000 deaths who declared the 2019-ncov a pandemic 4 as of may 5 2020 there is around 1171510 total number of both confirmed and probable 2019-ncov cases in the united states us the highest in the world and the total number of deaths is approximately 68279 the majority caused by pneumonia 5 person-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs primarily through close contact with an infected person mainly via respiratory droplets and after touching contaminated objects additional routes of transmission are currently under investigation including fecal viral shedding 6 the most common presenting symptoms are fever cough sore throat breathlessness fatigue and malaise the disease is mild in most people in some usually the elderly and those with comorbidities it may progress to pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiorgan dysfunction 7 in this systematic review based on findings of previously published case reports on pneumonia in 2019-ncov we have broadly summarized the transmission and pathology of 2019-ncov and demographics clinical presentation laboratory and chest imaging findings along with treatment and outcomes in 2019-ncov pneumonia patients study search strategy and selection the medline database from the national library of medicine nlm was used to identify case reports published in english from december 1 2019 to april 6 2020 the search strings in titleabstract were covid-19 or coronavirus or 2019-ncov and pneumonia that yielded 17 articles all searches and screening were done independently by two authors r patel j patel using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement prisma recommendations the titles and abstracts were screened based on the purpose of our review and resulted in the exclusion of one article a total of 16 case report articles met the criteria for our systematic review and were included as shown in figure 1 pathology and transmission cases of covid-2019 pneumonia are caused by a cov called sars-cov-2 which is a novel type of beta-cov the 2019-ncov is the seventh member of the cov family that includes middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov and sars-cov 8 most early patients had a history of exposure to the south china seafood market in wuhan the source of infection is proposed to be the chinese rufous horseshoe bat yet the exact source of the virus is still unknown 8-10 one study of two patients highlights the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing mngs approach on ribonucleic acid rna extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid it rapidly identifies the 2019-ncov which was the sole pathogen in the sample with a very high abundance level 15 and 062 of total rna sequenced based on the results of genome mapping data revealed extremely active cov replication in the lungs of patients 10 transmission of 2019-ncov is mainly via droplets but it can also be through contact with one another within six feet distance in an analysis of 75465 2019-ncov cases in china the airborne transmission was not reported 11 the incubation period of 2019-ncov is generally no longer than 14 days with a median time of four to five days from exposure to onset of symptoms and the patient is infective during the incubation period 8 elderly patients or those with underlying diseases are more seriously affected during the 2019-ncov pandemic whereas low infection rate and mild symptoms have been noted in the pediatric population which could potentially be explained by greater innate immunity early in life and less exposure compared to adults 12 elderly 2019-ncov infected patients are more likely to have bacterial infections which can be a contributing factor to a higher case fatality rate in the elderly 13 asymptomatic individuals may transmit 2019-ncov to other people but it remains to be determined how common are such transmissions transmission dynamics and the full spectrum of clinical illness are yet to be fully understood 14 pathophysiology 2019-ncov is comprised of a single-stranded rna structure that belongs to the coronavirinae subfamily sequence analysis of sars-cov-2 has shown a structure typical to that of other cov and its genome has been likened to a previously identified cov strain that caused the sars outbreak in 2003 15 2019-ncov shared 987 nucleotide identity to bat cov strain btcov4991 and 879 nucleotide identity to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 strains indicating that it was quite divergent from the currently known human cov including sars-cov 10 sars-cov-2 a single-stranded rna-enveloped virus targets cells through the viral structural spike s protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor following receptor binding the virus particle uses host cell receptors and endosomes to enter cells a host type 2 transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 facilitates cell entry via the s protein 16 ace2 is predominantly expressed by epithelial cells of the lung intestine kidney heart and blood vessels a recent study by liu et al showed that serum angiotensin ii levels in patients with 2019-ncov pneumonia was significantly higher compared with healthy individuals and were linearly associated with viral load and lung injury 13 based on this it can be postulated that sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 may attenuate residual ace2 activity skewing the aceace2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin ii activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage which increases the risk for acute lung injury 17 microscopic findings included diffuse alveolar damage with exudates 18 the inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic and multinucleated giant cells were seen alongside large atypical pneumocytes although no definitive viral inclusions were noted 19 demographics this study included published 16 case reports n  22 patients were from china korea taiwan canada and the us all patients with 2019-ncov were studied for the development of pneumonia patients were males n  13 and females n  9 with an age range from 10 to 75 years clinical presentation the most common clinical presentation of 2019-ncov infection includes fever fatigue and dry cough some patients present with nasal congestion runny nose myalgia and chills headache confusion chest tightness pleuritic chest discomfort rhinorrhea sore throat hemoptysis vomiting abdominal discomfort constipation and diarrhea have been reported but are less common 91020-22 some patients with 2019-ncov have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms 14 in one case report the patient complained of psychiatric symptoms such as depression insomnia and suicidal thoughts after isolation due to stress regarding peoples reactions from the media reports about the 2019-ncov patients 23 most patients came to visit the outpatient clinic andor emergency department ed after three to five days of onset of symptoms in some patients symptoms gradually worsened with exertional dyspnea high-grade fever and type i respiratory failure 102024 in severe cases dyspnea usually occurs one week after the onset of symptoms and some patients can rapidly progress in 8-12 days to ards the disease course of 2019-ncov pneumonia was similar in most cases with the exception of two patients with severe 2019-ncov pneumonia who developed complications such as ards septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes mods requiring non-invasive ventilation 2225 there was one case from korea of a 10-year-old girl who was in close contact with her uncle and mother who were confirmed to have 2019-ncov she presented with mild pneumonia on chest ct and recovered completely by only placing her in a negative isolation unit 12 in patients with a history of fever cough or contact with the epidemic area combined with significant chest ct findings timely detection of the 2019-ncov is required to ensure early diagnosis isolation and treatment 8 during the early stages of infection one cannot predict progression from upper respiratory infection to severe 2019-ncov pneumonia considering this it is safer to do a 2019-ncov screening test for all symptomatic patients with epidemiological risk than to wait until full-blown pneumonia develops 9 imaging results and lab findings chest ct scan is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool to detect pneumonia because the chest x-ray cxr could be normal in those patients with mild or no symptoms the most common finding on chest ct was ground-glass opacities involving bilateral lungs with peripheral distribution noted in most patients interlobular septal thickening and consolidation are common associated findings as 2019-ncov pneumonia progresses an increase in size and density of the ground-glass opacities or crazy-paving patterns were reported 24 one case demonstrated that the ground-glass opacities and consolidations will decrease in size as a patient recovers though the fibrotic changes may remain as a sequela after recovery 20 subpleural opacities were also observable with lesions limited to lower lobe lung 891226-28 with a high-resolution chest ct it will be easier to find ground-glass opacities in the early stage 26 a few cases reported abnormalities on chest ct when cxr was normal which led to an early diagnosis 92326 however the chest ct imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections making the diagnostic value of chest ct imaging for 2019-ncov low and dependent upon interpretations from individual radiologists 29 chest ct should not be used as a first-line test for screening or diagnosis and should be reserved for hospitalized symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications given the variability in chest imaging findings chest radiograph or chest ct alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of 2019-ncov 22 confirmation with the viral test is required even if radiologic findings are suggestive of 2019-ncov on cxr or chest ct 30 in throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract that were obtained from all patients 2019-ncov was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 10 detection of sars-cov-2 rna in the blood may be a marker of severe illness 31 sars-cov-2 rna has also been detected in stool samples test for respiratory panel including respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza virus rhinovirus adenovirus metapneumovirus mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae legionella pneumophila and cov strains like hku1 nl63 229e oc43 and influenza a and b were all negative 810142126 lymphopenia is the most common lab finding in 2019-ncov patients in one case a detailed laboratory investigation revealed lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt c-reactive protein crp and lactate dehydrogenase ldh which may be associated with greater illness severity 2022 laboratory findings in one of the patients showed that there were elevated blood levels of crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and d-dimer level 27 some other findings on laboratory results were elevated creatine kinase ck elevated alkaline phosphatase alp increased level of hematocrit increased neutrophil count decreased lymphocyte count increased lymphokine and thrombocytopenia 14212426 treatment and outcomes the milder spectrum of pneumonia caused by 2019-ncov suggests that the identification of individuals who could be managed by being quarantined at home rather than in a hospital might be an important strategy for containing the 2019-ncov pandemic 21 patients who have mild illness usually recover at home with supportive care and isolation in accordance with guidelines patients who have moderate or severe diseases are usually monitored in the hospital 32 treatment modalities for all the patients included isolation in a negative pressure room and supportive care such isolation rooms can control airflow to prevent viruses from escaping into the rest of the hospital preferred empirical antibiotics were ceftriaxone amoxicillinclavulanate and tabaxin meropenem and linezolid and antiviral medications included oseltamivir and ganciclovir and interferon inhalation 2026273334 one of the cases that was tested positive for 2019-ncov was isolated in negative pressure room and treated with antiviral medication lopinavir lpv 200 mgcapsule ritonavir rtv 50 mgcapsule twice a day bid interestingly the next day cov load monitored by quantitative real-time rt-pcr decreased significantly to no detectable titers 23 one study found that four 2019-ncov positive patients were administered antiviral treatment including lpvrtv arbidol and shufeng jiedu capsule sfjdc a traditional chinese medicine and supplemental oxygen after the treatment three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia symptoms and routine blood analysis revealed that leukocytes and lymphocytes were increased indicating restoration of the immune system and they were confirmed 2019-ncov negative and discharged only one of the four patients developed severe pneumonia and received immunoglobulin therapy with intubated ventilator-assisted breathing therapy due to refractory low blood oxygen pressure and this patient also showed signs of clinical improvement 22 one of the cases received supportive treatment initially and later on received vancomycin and cefepime this patient developed severe pneumonia with high 2019-ncov viral load and so received antiviral therapy with intravenous remdesivir a novel nucleotide analog prodrug in development on day 7 and the next day patients clinical condition significantly improved 14 when lpvrtv was used in high-risk groups of 2019-ncov pneumonia it showed reduced viral loads and improvement in clinical symptoms during the treatment 23 lpvrtv regimen has shown substantial clinical benefit in china and is currently recommended along with sfjdc by national health commission of the peoples republic of china 35 however observational studies done during an epidemic often do not have concurrent controls have a significant risk of bias and use surrogate outcomes like viral clearance rather than patient-important outcomes 36 most of the patients in our systematic review demonstrated a good prognosis with no complications however two patients had developed ards and mods all the patients at the end of hospitalization were cured and discharged in stable condition currently the centers for disease control and prevention cdc panel recommends against the use of combination of lpvrtv or other human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitors for the treatment of 2019-ncov pneumonia except in the context of a clinical trial 37 on the contrary remdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of rna viruses including sarsmers-cov5 infection in cultured cells mice and non-human primate models 38 in vitro studies showed that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov replication and in an in vitro test utilizing epithelial cell cultures of a primary human airway remdesivir was effective against bat-cov pre-pandemic bat-cov and circulating contemporary human-cov in primary human lung cells remdesivir improved pulmonary function reduced lung viral loads and ameliorated severe lung pathology 39 in contrast prophylactic lpvrtv-interferon- ifn- reduced viral loads and did not impact other disease parameters and therapeutic lpvrtv-ifn- improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology overall these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than lpvrtv-ifn- for treating mers-cov infections 40 also a systematic review on acute respiratory distress patients who were positive for 2019-ncov was managed with lpvrtv with or without oseltamivir out of which the majority of them showed significant improvement 41  patients with advanced 2019-ncov pneumonia who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received a placebo according to a preliminary data analysis from the first randomized controlled trial rct involving 1063 patients in the us 42 recently the us food and drug administration fda issued an emergency use authorization eua allowing for remdesivir to be distributed in the us and administered by healthcare providers as appropriate to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-ncov positive adults and children with severe disease 43 an overview of the included case reports is shown in table 1 the results of our systematic review of published case reports of pneumonia in 2019-ncov positive patients will help healthcare professionals to understand the pathophysiology and transmission clinical presentation imaging and laboratory findings and treatment most patients presented with fever fatigue and dry cough some present with nasal congestion runny nose myalgia and chills the most common finding on chest ct was ground-glass opacities involving bilateral lungs with the peripheral distribution lymphopenia was the most common lab finding and along with other inflammatory markers in patients with greater illness severity the use of lpvrtv and remdesivir was associated with significant clinical improvement in severe pneumonia nonetheless we need more rcts and treatment guidelines for developing effective management of the 2019-ncov and improve patient outcomes by reducing mortality in high-risk patients  uncertainty about the efficacy of remdesivir on covid-19 jin-hong yoo   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is betraying what we hoped for and going into a boring and exhausting war to break this everlasting vicious cycle vaccines and special antiviral drugs must be developed1 agents to treat covid-19 can be broadly classified into two categories one is an agent that directly attacks the virus and the other that interferes with the virus life cycle the ideal agent of course is to attack or kill the virus directly however to date a means that can directly attack viruses is disinfectants or antibodies while none of the antiviral agents directly attacks the virus body itself yet neutralizing antibody should be obtained by convalescent plasma from recovered patients and the amount of supply is limited monoclonal antibodies are still under clinical trial disinfectants cannot be used directly on humans antivirals used to date interfere with the life cycle of viruses and are classified into three types first there is an antiviral agent that prevents viruses from entering the host cell umifenovir is a good example next there is an antiviral that prevents the virus from activation protease inhibitors such as ritonavir-boosted lopinavir belong to this category and perhaps the most preferred antiviral agent is the drug that inhibits the viral replication remdesivir is currently the most attracting attention as a drug that ultimately interferes with the activity of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp by inhibiting replication the basic structure of remdesivir is the nucleoside nucleotide since this structure serves as a nucleoside analogue rna chain elongation of corona virus cannot proceed any more as a result rdrp is inhibited by preventing replication of the virus currently indications for administering remdesivir in covid-19 are mainly patients with severe lower respiratory disease although the formal standard for severe covid-19 has not yet been established it is generally agreed that high requirement for oxygen on room air or under the mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is the remdesivir a definitive treatment regimen for covid-19 regrettably the current assessment of remdesivir does not seem to be entirely positive the first full-scale clinical trial of remdesivir was conducted in china from february to march 2020 and the results were very disappointing it did not significantly reduce covid-19 disease duration and mortality moreover a number of serious side effects occurred quite a bit and the clinical trial had to be terminated early2 on the other hand a clinical trial conducted in the united states produced relatively favorable result3 in remdesivir group time to recovery was shortened compared with that of the placebo group however the mortality was not significantly different between the two groups taken together the results suggest that remdesivir shortens the duration of the disease but does not affect prognosis significantly then is the remdesivir less valuable as a covid-19 treatment i cannot conclude that it is from a practical standpoint covid-19 pandemic is still not suppressed so it is inevitable to try drugs that could work several drugs have been suggested but at this point remdesivir is worth trying as a solution remdesivir is undergoing clinical trials in a few medical institutions in korea and recently received emergency approval by the korean ministry of food and drug safety unlike the precedent of oseltamivir used during the swine flu pandemic in 2009 however remdesivir is not expected to have the effect of lowering the rate of propagation and reducing the incidence by administering to all patients in the early stage of covid-19 pandemic it should not be forgotten that remdesivir was not originally designed to target covid-19 it is an antiviral drug originally designed to treat hepatitis c ebola and marburg virus since there is no specific targeting drug to use right now it is only a repurposed drug used on the basis of the mechanism of action therefore dont expect miracles about remdesivirs performance and lower expectations in a word at least now remdesivir is not a magic panacea even if remdesivir has a strong effect we will need to find a partner or partners with something synergistic eventually a definite antiviral treatment strategy for covid-19 should be an appropriate and effective combination regimen until the regimen is established optimism for remdesivir should be avoided for the time being  structural basis for inhibition of the rna-dependent rna polymerase from

sheng-ce tao jingshan shen yi jiang hualiang jiang yechun xu shuyang zhang yan zhang h xu eric   the covid-19 pandemic caused by the virus sars-cov-2 has become a humanitarian crisis with over 15 million infections and 87000 death as reported on april 8 of 2020 1 2 which has increased rapidly to over 299 million infections and 207000 death on april 27 of 2020 2 sars-cov-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and several members from the beta coronavirus family including bat and pangolin coronaviruses 35 possibly due to stronger binding affinity of the virus spike protein for the host receptor 610 sars-cov-2 has much higher incidence of human to human transmission resulting in infection worldwide sars-cov-2 is a positive strand rna virus its replication is mediated by a multi-subunit replicationtranscription complex of viral non-structural proteins nsp 11 the core component of this complex is the catalytic subunit nsp12 of an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 12 13 by itself nsp12 has little activity and its functions require accessory factors including nsp7 and nsp8 14 15 which increase rdrp template binding and processivity rdrp is also proposed to be the target of a class of antiviral drugs that are nucleotide analogs including remdesivir 1618 which is a prodrug that is converted to the active drug in the triphosphate form rtp within cells 19 as such rdrp has been a subject of intensive structural biology efforts the structures of nsp7 nsp8 and the complex of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 have been determined 15 2023 providing the overall architecture of the rdrp complex however the drug discovery effort is hampered because there is no structure of the sars-cov-2 rdrp in complex with an rna template or with nucleotide inhibitors here we determined two cryo-em structures of the sars-cov-2 rdrp complex either in the apo form or in a complex with a template-primer rna and the antiviral drug remdesivir for cryo-em studies we co-expressed nsp12 with nsp7 and nsp8 to form the core rdrp complex in insect cells fig 1a and fig s1 a to d the stoichiometric ratio of nsp7 and nsp8 appeared to be less than nsp12 thus additional bacterially expressed nsp7 and nsp8 were supplemented before the final purification step to improve the yield of heterotrimeric complex the purified nsp12 alone showed little activity in binding to a 50-base partial double-stranded template-primer rna fig 1b and fig s1e which is similar to the sars-cov nsp12 14 the presence of nsp7 and nsp8 dramatically increased nsp12 binding to the template-primer rna fig s1e the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex also showed rna polymerization activity on a poly-u template upon addition of adenosine triphosphate atp fig 1 b and c this rna polymerization activity was effectively inhibited by the addition of the active triphosphate form of remdesivir rtp fig 1d even in the presence of 10 mm atp 1 mm rtp completely inhibited rdrp polymerization activity in contrast remdesivir as a prodrug at 5 mm concentration did not have any inhibitory effect on the polymerization activity of the purified enzyme fig s1f neither did remdesivir in its monophosphate form rmp fig s1g the purified rdrp complex is relatively thermostable with a melting temperature of 53c fig s1h negative-stain em visualization of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed monodispersed particles with excellent homogeneity fig s1i for the apo nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex we vitrified the sample in the presence of the detergent ddm the initial attempt at image processing revealed that the particles are preferentially oriented fig s2a therefore we collected over 7400 micrograph movies of more than 57 million particle projections to increase the number of projection from the non-preferential orientation of these 81494 particles were used to yield a density map of 28  resolution fig s2 b and e cryo-em studies of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex bound with the template-primer rna and rtp termed as the template-rtp rdrp complex faced two challenges fig s3 first most particles were adsorbed to cryo-em grid bars rather than staying in the vitreous ice second the rna duplex were dissociated from the template-rtp rdrp complex likely due to conditions of cryo-em specimen preparation eventually we prepared the cryo-em specimen of the template-rtp rdrp complex at 15 mgml much higher than normal concentrations used for em studies of soluble protein complexes the high concentration of the complex has a mass action effect to stabilize the rna-protein complex and has excess amount of the complex to escape the absorption of cryo-em grid bars to enter the vitreous ice fig s3 we collected 2886 micrograph movies which yielded a 25  resolution structure using 130386 particle projections because of the relatively high resolution of our structure the em map is clear for key structural features across the complex fig s4 a to f the structure of the apo rdrp complex contains one nsp12 one nsp7 and two nsp8 with an overall arrangement resembling those seen in sars-cov and the recently solved structure of sars-cov-2 15 23 fig 2 a and b different from the sars-cov rdrp structure but similar to the recent sars-cov-2 rdrp structure our structure reveals that nsp12 also contains an n-terminal -hairpin residues 31-50 and an extended nidovirus rdrp-associated nucleotidyl-transferase domain niran residues 115-250 24 with seven helices and three -strands 15 23 following the niran domain is an interface domain residues 251-365 composed of three helices and five -strands which is connected to the rdrp domain residues 366-920 figs 1a and 2b the nsp12 rdrp domain displays the canonical cupped right-handed configuration 25 with the finger subdomain resides 397-581 and residues 621-679 forming a closed circle with the thumb subdomain residues 819-920 fig 2 a and b the closed conformation is stabilized by the binding of nsp7 and nsp8 with one nsp8 molecule sitting on the top of the finger subdomain and interacting with the interface domain the closed conformation of nsp12 is further stabilized by the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer which is packed against the thumb-finger interface fig 2 a and b in addition we were able to assign two zinc ions in the conserved metal binding motifs composed by h295-c301-c306-c310 and c487-h642-c645-c646 fig 2c which are also observed in the sars-cov rdrp structure 15 these zinc ions likely serve as conserved structural components in maintaining the integrity of the rdrp architecture the structure of the template-rtp rdrp complex contains one nsp12 one nsp7 and one nsp8 fig 3 a and b the second nsp8 was largely invisible in the em map of the template-rtp complex fig s4c therefore it was not included in the final model in addition the template-rtp rdrp structure contains 14-base rna in the template strand 11-base rna in the primer strand and the inhibitor remdesivir in its monophosphate form rmp fig 3 c and d which is covalently linked to the primer strand as well as a pyrophosphate and three magnesium ions that may serve as catalytic ions near the active site fig 3d and fig s4 d to f 26 the overall structure of the template-rtp rdrp complex is similar to the apo rdrp structure with nsp12 in a closed conformation figs 2a and 3a the double-stranded rna helix formed by 11 base-pairs from the template-primer rna figs 3c and 4 a to e is held by the finger-palm-thumb subdomains extensive protein-rna interactions are observed between the template-primer rna and nsp12 with a total of 29 residues from nsp12 directly participating in the binding of the rna fig 4e surprisingly no rna interactions are mediated by nsp7 or nsp8 although these two proteins are required for rna binding by rdrp most protein-rna interactions involve the rna phosphate-ribose backbones with many interactions directly to 2-oh groups fig 4e thus providing a basis to distinguish rna from dna there are no contacts from nsp12 to any base pairs of the template-primer rna suggesting a sequence independent binding of rna by rdrp this is consistent with the fact that no specific sequence is required for the enzymatic activity of rdrp at the elongation step at the 3 end of the primer strand is remdesivir monophosphate rmp figs 3d and 4 d and e and fig s4 e and f which is covalently incorporated into the primer strand at the 1 position fig 4e additional nucleotides at the 2 and 3 positions of the template strand interact with residues from the back of finger subdomain fig 4 a and b despite the presence of excess rtp in complex assembly only a single rmp is assembled into the primer strand as observed in the structure thus remdesivir like many nucleotide analog prodrugs inhibits the viral rdrp activity through non-obligate rna chain termination a mechanism that requires the conversion of the parent drug to the active triphosphate form 27 28 the rmp position is at the center of the catalytic active site fig 3d as an adenosine monophosphate analog rmp forms base-stacking interactions with upstream base from the primer strand and two hydrogen bonds with the uridine base from the template strand fig 3d and fig s5 in addition rmp also forms interactions with side chains from k545 and r555 near the bound rmp are two magnesium ions and a pyrophosphate both magnesium ions interact with the phosphate diester backbone and they are part of catalytic active site the pyrophosphate is at the gate of the nucleotide entry channel to the active site and may block the entry of nucleotide triphosphate to the active side fig 3 c and d the catalytic active site of the nsp12 rdrp is constructed by seven conserved motifs from a to g figs 1a and 3e and fig s6 motifs abcd are from the palm subdomain with an sdd sequence residues 759-761 in motif c forming the catalytic active center fig 3d both d760 and d761 are involved in coordination of the two magnesium ions at the catalytic center motifs f and g are located within the finger subdomain and they interact with the template strand rna and direct this strand into the active site fig 3e motif f also interacts with the primer strand rna with the side chains of k545 and r555 contacting the 1 base fig 3d thus stabilizing the incoming nucleotide in the correct position for catalysis the orientation of template-primer rna in the active site is similar to the orientation of template-primer rna in the poliovirus rdrp elongation complex 29 and the hcv ns5b rdrp inhibitor complex 30 fig s7 the residues involved in rna binding as well as residues comprising the catalytic active site are highly conserved 31 32 highlighting the conserved mechanism of genome replication by rdrp in these diverse rna viruses and suggesting it may be possible to develop broad spectrum antiviral inhibitors such as remdesivir 18 and galidesivir bcx4430 33 structural comparison reveals several interesting differences between the apo and complex structures fig 3 e and f and fig s8 a and b first nsp7 moves toward the rdrp core by 15  as measured by nsp7 residue f49 fig s8 a and b leading to a rearrangement of the interface which results in weaker association of the second nsp8 in the complex second the loop that connects the first and second helix of the thumb subdomain moves outward by 28  as measured by nsp12 residue i847 to accommodate the binding of the double stranded rna helix fig 3f third motif g residues k500 and s501 also move outward by 20  to accommodate the binding of the template strand rna outside of these changes the apo nsp12 and the rna-complex nsp12 are very similar with an rmsd of 052  for all c atoms across the whole protein in particular the structural elements that make up the catalytic active site can be exactly superimposed fig 3e suggesting that the sars-cov-2 rdrp is a relatively stable enzyme that is ready to function as a replicase upon binding of rna template viral rdrp is a highly processive enzyme with a rate of replication up to 100 nucleotides per second 34 no significant conformational changes between the apo and the active enzyme structures are consistent with the high processivity of the viral rna polymerase which does not need to consume additional energy for conformational changes in the active site during the replication cycle besides remdesivir several nucleotide analog drugs including favipiravir ribavirin galidesivir and eidd-2801 efficiently inhibit sars-cov-2 replication in cell-based assays 35 36 like remdesivir these nucleotide analogs are proposed to inhibit the viral rdrp through non-obligate rna chain termination a mechanism that requires the conversion of the parent compound to the triphosphate active form 33 the structure of the template-rtp rdrp complex provides an excellent model to rationalize how these drugs inhibit the sars-cov-2 rdrp activity fig s8c in particular eidd-2801 has been shown to be 3-10 times more potent than remdesivir in blocking sars-cov-2 replication 36 the n4 hydroxyl group off the cytidine ring forms an extra hydrogen bond with the side chain of k545 and cytidine base also forms an extra hydrogen bond with the guanine base from the template strand these two extra hydrogen bonds may explain the apparent higher potency of eidd-2801 in inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication the covid-19 pandemic has inflicted emotional pain and economic burden across the globe enzymes that are vital for the viral life cycle are excellent antiviral drug targets as they are different from the host proteins among viral enzymes rdrp is the major target of many existing nucleotide drugs in this paper we report the structure of the sars-cov-2 rdrp complex in the apo form and in the complex with a template-primer rna and the active form of remdesivir the structures reveal how the template-primer rna is recognized by the enzyme and how chain elongation is inhibited by remdesivir structure comparison and sequence alignment suggest that the mode of substrate rna recognition and remdesivir inhibition of rdrp is highly conserved in diverse rna viruses providing a basis for designing broad spectrum antiviral drugs based on nucleotide analogs moreover our structures provide a solid template for modeling and modifying the existing nucleotide drugs including the highly potent eidd-2801 together these observations provide a rational basis to design even more potent inhibitors to combat the vicious infection of sars-cov-2  nucleoside analogues for the treatment of coronavirus infections andrea pruijssers j mark denison r   coronaviruses covs are a family of enveloped viruses containing a positive-sense rna genome covs belong to the family coronaviridae within the order nidovirales the coronaviridae henceforth referred to as covs infect a broad range of vertebrates including mammals and birds of the six cov strains isolated from humans four strains hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 cause a usually mild self-limiting upper respiratory infection accounting for an estimated 1529 of common colds 1 two other human cov strains have produced more serious respiratory disease epidemics in recent years severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov originated in china in 2002 and 2003 and spread to a total of 37 countries causing more than 8000 cases of sars with an estimated fatality rate of 9 2 the cause of an ongoing epidemic of middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 and to date has caused more than 2374 cases in 27 countries with a fatality rate 34 34 the use of human host cell receptors by both human and bat covs supports predictions of significant risk for emergence of new potential pandemic zoonotic covs 56 notably no vaccines or antiviral compounds are approved for prevention or treatment of human or potential zoonotic covs emerging covs have been accorded priority status by who and government agencies for development of prevention and treatment strategies due to severity of these infections and credible pandemic potential 7 8 9 this review will focus on opportunities for and challenges to development of antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues targeting viral rna synthesis as effective therapeutics against cov infections drugs currently under investigation for use against cov disease include monoclonal antibodies direct-acting antivirals daas including as protease helicase and polymerase inhibitors and immunomodulators such as interferons and corticosteroids challenges to cov antivirals development are both general to rna viruses and specific to covs the replication of positive-sense rna virus genomes is generally characterized by high error rates high viral yields short replication times and abundant homologous and nonhomologous recombination 10 in consequence viral swarms are generated which consist of a diverse population of genome mutants with varying degrees of fitness this genetic plasticity challenges development of broadly useful antivirals by enabling rapid development of drug resistance while preserving overall viral fitness development of nucleoside analogue inhibitors of covs is further hampered by the novel rna-dependent rna proofreading activity of cov nonstructural protein 14 a 3 to 5 exoribonuclease nsp14-exon which confers up to 20-fold increase in replication fidelity compared with other rna viruses the nsp14-exon activity is responsible for native cov high resistance to many nucleoside analogues including ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil 11 12 13 nevertheless the recent development of nucleotide and nucleoside analogue inhibitors with a high barrier for resistance broad-spectrum activity against multiple covs and the ability to inhibit wt covs in the presence of nsp14-exon holds promise for the treatment of cov disease nucleotide and nucleoside analogue inhibitors hereafter abbreviated ni are chemically synthesized analogues of purines and pyrimidines in which the heterocyclic ring or sugar moiety has been altered currently used to treat both chronic and acute viral infections nis are administered as nucleotide or nucleoside precursors or prodrugs which are metabolized by host or viral kinases to their active triphosphate once inside the cell nis exert inhibitory effects on viral replication by one or more non-mutually exclusive mechanisms figure 1
 first mis-incorporation of foreign nucleotides in replicating viral genomes may cause chain termination and disrupt subsequent replication or transcription chain termination may be immediate obligate or may occur following a limited extent of continued rna or dna synthesis non-obligate second nis may incorporate into elongating nucleotide chains mispairing with andor substituting natural nucleotides thereby introducing mutations that potentially impair rna synthesis structure or rnaprotein interactions or protein functions accumulation of mutations and loss of virus viability are referred to as lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe 14 through these mechanisms nis alter the genetic makeup of the virus leading to a decrease in viral fitness with every consecutive replication cycle finally nis may cause depletion of pools of naturally occurring nucleotides by mimicking 15 nis demonstrate a relatively high barrier to resistance emergence because the structural conservation of the binding site of their polymerase targets is high among virus families and resistance mutations generally incur a fitness cost for the enzyme and the virus 16 for covs amino acid conservation of the viral rdrp ranges from 70 to near 100 and is maintained across genera suggesting nis could potentially serve as broad-spectrum inhibitors of cov infection 17 however proofreading activity of nsp14-exon activity protects covs from many nis effective against other rna viruses 1218 to effectively inhibit covs an ni needs to either evade recognition by exon or undergo uptake into the elongating strand at a rate exceeding exon excision kinetics we will next discuss several antiviral nis described in the literature and evidence supporting their efficacy against covs 
ribavirin 1--d-ribofuranosyl-1 24-triazole-3-carboxyamide is a guanosine analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against rna viruses it is used to treat hepatitis c and e virus respiratory syncytial virus lassa virus and hantavirus infections in its monophosphate form ribavirin interactions with inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh a host enzyme vital to nucleotide biosynthesis result in decreased guanosine production leading to inhibition of viral rna synthesis though depletion of cellular gtp pools 19 furthermore incorporation of its triphosphate form by the viral polymerase leads to lethal mutagenesis 20 the proofreading activity of exon leaves covs impervious to doses of ribavirin that inhibit other viruses effectively 12 although high dose ribavirin showed partial inhibition of sars-cov and mers-cov replication in vitro table 1
 1821 drug treatment increased viral load and exacerbated disease in a mouse model of sars-cov disease 22 ribavirin treatment did not improve the clinical outcome of sars-cov disease in human subjects and caused significant toxicity 2324 synergistic activity against mers-cov of ribavirin combined with ifn2b was observed in vitro and in rhesus macaques suggesting that ifn increases the potency of ribavirin at lower more tolerable concentrations 2526 however five critically ill mers-cov-positive patients who were treated with a combination of ribavirin and ifn2b showed no clinical improvement 27 treatment of 20 mers patients with a combination of ribavirin and ifn2a showed significantly improved survival at 14 days but not at 28 days 28 whereas treatment of mers patients with a combination of ifn2a or ifn1a and ribavirin yielded no survival benefit in another study 29 thus although ribavirin shows some efficacy in vitro it does not provide clinical benefit to humans with sars-cov or mers-cov infections 
remdesivir gilead science gs-5734 is a phosphoramidate prodrug of the adenosine ni gs-441524 which is effective against filoviruses pneumoviruses and paramyxoviruses and is currently in a phase i dose-escalation trial for ebola virus infection 30 biochemical studies indicate that remdesivir acts as a non-obligate chain terminator 31 remdesivir is effective against a broad spectrum of human and pre-epidemic zoonotic covs and potently inhibits replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in primary human airway epithelial cultures table 1 1732 mice infected with a lethal dose of sars-cov displayed less weight loss lower lung viral titer and reduced lung pathology following prophylactic or therapeutic administration of remdesivir 17 a partial resistance phenotype was attributed to two mutations in the viral rdrp suggesting remdesivir acts on this target 32 importantly the fitness and virulence of remdesivir-resistant sars-cov was reduced compared to wt sars-cov indicating the barrier to remdesivir resistance is high 17 increased potency of remdesivir against cov lacking exon catalytic activity suggests that the drug is sensitive to proofreading by exon albeit to a markedly lower extent than other nis 32 this raises important questions about the mechanism of cov inhibition by remdesivir which may be recognized by exon but removed less efficiently or may be less visible to exon compared with other nis studies probing the interactions between remdesivir and the cov replication machinery will likely yield crucial insights into how this ni circumvents or overcomes cov proofreading activity which can in turn be applied to modeling the development of new nis and enhancing potency of existing nis

other nis with in vitro activity against covs and low cytotoxicity include the adenosine analogue bcx4430 which has broad spectrum activity against positive and negative sense rna viruses and has shown antiviral activity against mers-cov and sars-cov 3139 the deoxycytidine analogue gemcitabine hydrochloride a chemotherapy drug that inhibits sars-cov and mers-cov 40 the uridine analogue 6-azauridine with activity against hcov-nl63 36 and the immunosuppressant imidazole nucleoside mizoribine which inhibits sars-cov table 1 18 flex-base modification of the guanosine analog acyclovir acyclovir fleximer yielded activity against hcov-nl63 and mers-cov table 1 41 more research into the efficacy potency and mechanism of cov inhibition is necessary to determine whether further development of these compounds as cov antivirals is warranted as with sars-cov and mers-cov new zoonotic covs likely will emerge from divergent virus pools in animal reservoirs it is therefore critical to develop broad-spectrum anti-cov strategies aimed at multiple conserved targets and functions despite high conservation of the viral rdrp and low tolerance for mutations at key residues resistance against nis due to mutations in the viral rdrp has been observed in covs and other rna viruses 3242434445 treatment with combinations of potent anti-cov nis could increase the barrier to resistance and enhance efficacy especially if additive or synergistic interactions occur moreover a therapeutic regimen that combines drugs with distinct modes of action or which interfere at different steps in the viral replication cycle could simultaneously increase antiviral potency broaden the activity spectrum and reduce the emergence of drug resistance against covs classes of candidate companion compounds include nis helicase inhibitors protease inhibitors monoclonal antibodies viral entry inhibitors and deddh family exoribonuclease inhibitors with potential activity against exon 464748 the latter deserving special interest deddh inhibitors aurintricarboxylic acid and pontacyl violet 6r effectively inhibited lassa virus np exonuclease in a proof-of-concept biochemical assay 48 the structural and functional conservation across cov family members and the absence of redundant functions elsewhere in the genome makes exon a potential achilles heel combining compounds that inhibit exon activity with one or more nis would simultaneously reduce cov replication fidelity boost the potency of the ni mitigate selective pressures leading to drug resistance and ultimately attenuate viral disease finally both sars-cov and mers-cov infections spur exuberant host inflammatory responses that rapidly progress toward severe immunopathology the most probable driver of morbidity and death rather than direct viral damage to pulmonary tissues 49 this potentially limits the therapeutic window for daas thus combinations of daas and targeted immunomodulators may be necessary to halt lethal progression of immunopathology and extend the therapeutic window for intervention a multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial miracle nct02845843 is currently in progress to determine the efficacy of combining the immunomodulator ifn1b with lopinavir-ritonavir a protease inhibitor cocktail used to treat hiv that also inhibits mers-cov in vitro 50 adequately controlled prospective studies like miracle are urgently needed to assess efficacy of candidate cov drugs these studies should include compounds that have demonstrated broad-spectrum in vivo efficacy against covs such as remdesivir knowing that additional novel zoonotic covs are an inevitable future occurrence nothing declared papers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted as of special interest of outstanding interest
  coronavirus disease 2019 treatment a review of early and emerging options erin mccreary k jason pogue m   remdesivir gs-5734 is an investigational monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog that was developed by gilead sciences inc in response to the ebola outbreak in west africa from 2014 to 2016 in its active triphosphate nucleoside form remdesivir binds to ribonucleic acid rna-dependent rna polymerase and acts as an rna-chain terminator it displays potent in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 with an ec50 at 48 hours of 077 m in vero e6 cells 3 similar activity has been demonstrated against other zoonotic coronaviruses with ec50 values of 007 m demonstrated for both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov 36 remdesivir is highly selective for viral polymerases and is therefore expected to have a low propensity to cause human toxicity accordingly sheahan et al 6 demonstrated a wide therapeutic index for remdesivir in a human airway epithelial cell model the drug also displays a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and has a long intracellular half-life that allows for once-daily dosing 7 8 the dose under investigation for treatment of covid-19 is 200 mg intravenously iv on day 1 followed by 100 mg iv daily for up to 10 days infused over 3060 minutes table 1 the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir was first described in an animal model against ebola among infected rhesus monkeys in which once-daily dosing resulted in suppression of viral replication and protection from lethal disease 9 however in a human study remdesivir-treated patients with ebola experienced a 28-day mortality rate of 53 in a randomized controlled trial of 4 experimental therapies conducted in response to the democratic republic of congo outbreak of 2018 resulting in early termination of this study arm 10 it is worth noting that this trial did not have an active control arm and mortality rates for the other experimental treatments were 497 zmapp 351 mab114 and 335 regn-eb3 against mers-cov sheahan et al 5 evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir among infected mice and found treatment significantly reduced virus lung titers weight loss lung hemorrhage and lung injury scores the authors proposed the importance of early therapy initiation to diminish virus replication and promote pulmonary repair because remdesivir demonstrated less clinical benefit with high-titer virus inoculum most notably the authors also noted that prophylactic remdesivir diminished mers-cov replication and disease which was similar to their findings in a murine model with sars-cov-1 5 6 the first report of a remdesivir-treated patient with covid-19 in the united states was a 35-year-old male in snohomish county washington who received treatment on hospital day 7 illness day 11 due to developing pneumonia and persistent fevers 11 the patient experienced clinical improvement and negativity of oropharyngeal swab on hospital day 8 although nasopharyngeal swab remained positive no adverse events to remdesivir were reported for the patient which is consistent with previous case reports of use in other viruses 12 13 among the first 12 patients confirmed by the cdc to have covid-19 in the united states 3 were treated with remdesivir via compassionate use protocol 14 all patients reported transient gastrointestinal symptoms and aminotransferase elevation all patients are reportedly recovering but the authors were unable to assess the efficacy or safety of remdesivir based on the lack of comparator and confounding treatments including concomitant use of corticosteroids in one patient there are 4 clinical trials currently enrolling patients in the united states table 1 two additional trials recruiting only in china have been registered on clinicaltrialsgov nct04257656 severe disease and nct04252664 mildmoderate disease remdesivir may also be obtained through compassionate use and the emergency investigational new drug eind application process at the time of this review requests for compassionate use must be submitted online via httpsrdvcugileadcom compassionate use is only considered for hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 requiring mechanical ventilation in whom enrollment in a clinical trial is not feasible patients are excluded from the compassionate use program if they do not meet the above criteria have evidence of multiorgan failure are receiving vasopressors for hypotension have liver disease defined as alanine aminotransferase alt 5  upper limit of normal uln or renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance crcl 30 mlmin or receiving dialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration inclusion and exclusion criteria for compassionate use may change so applicants are encouraged to review the most up to date criteria for all potential patients clinicians should be cognizant that it typically takes a minimum of 72 hours for institutions to receive emergency institutional review board authorization if required protocol and consent forms from gilead us food and drug administration fda-approval for the eind and eventual drug shipment clinicians should coordinate with their local information technology teams to build a medication order sentence into the electronic health record during this time patients may receive other antiviral therapies during the waiting period but must immediately discontinue them if they receive remdesivir for compassionate use it is interesting to note that the adaptive clinical trial protocol originally stated remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of cyp-3a4 this implies the existence of a drug-drug interaction with cyp3a4 substrate inhibitors such as ritonavir or voriconazole however the protocol also stated although remdesivir is a substrate for cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 in vitro coadministration with inhibitors of these cyp isoforms is unlikely to markedly increase remdesivir levels as its metabolism is likely to be predominantly mediated by hydrolase activity unlike the former the latter statement is substantiated by well described chemistry of the molecule the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases was contacted about this discrepancy and in collaboration with gilead this has been corrected there is no reason to believe that any significant drug interactions between remdesivir and cyp3a4 inhibitors or inducers are likely 8 emerging clinical evidence and available in vitro data suggest remdesivir is a promising agent for the treatment of covid-19 institutions should explore clinical trial enrollment or compassionate use remdesivir for moderate-to-severe patients additional clinical data are eagerly anticipated and should help further define the role of this agent in covid-19 chloroquine an antimalarial agent with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities has gained significant interest as a potential therapeutic option for the management of covid-19 in early february wang et al 3 demonstrated potent in vitro activity of chloroquine against sars-cov-2 with an ec50 at 48 hours of 113 m in vero e6 cells these data were consistent with previous data for chloroquines inhibitory activity against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in various cell lines where ec50 values of 188 and 30 m were demonstrated respectively 15 these findings have supported the clinical use of chloroquine at a dose of 500 mg by mouth twice daily in numerous clinical trials in china during this outbreak although the rationale for this dosing regimen remains unclear and peer reviewed data from the trials are currently unavailable it was announced in mid-february that promising early results have been demonstrated per gao et al 16 thus far results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate were not noted in the aforementioned patients  although this development has been encouraging supply issues in the united states and cardiovascular toxicity concerns limit the use of chloroquine as an alternative hydroxychloroquine a compound that differs from chloroquine only by a single hydroxyl group has garnered interest hydroxychloroquine is perceived as having better tolerability than chloroquine which has led to long-term usage in rheumatological disorders historically very limited data were published assessing the activity of hydroxychloroquine against coronaviruses in 2006 biot et al 17 assessed the comparative inhibitory activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-1 in vero cells the authors demonstrated that chloroquine had an approximately 5-fold increased potency ec50 of 65  32 m compared with that of hydroxychloroquine ec50 of 34  5 m against sars-cov-2 yao et al 18 performed a 2-part study assessing the comparative in vitro activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and performed pharmacology-based pharmacokinetic pbpk modeling to assess comparative exposure and predicted activity of these 2 compounds in the lung in vitro analyses in vero cells demonstrated that the potency of hydroxychloroquine ec50 of 072 m was greater than that of chloroquine ec50 of 547 m against sars-cov-2 18 to inform optimal dosing of hydroxychloroquine the investigators then performed pbpk modeling in this analysis the investigators utilized human population pharmacokinetic and rat lung penetration data for each compound to estimate free trough concentrations in the lung to ec50 ratios rltec 18 because 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily has been reported to demonstrate efficacy against sars-cov-2 the target rltec for hydroxychloroquine regimens was set to 238 day 1 592 day 3 and 189 day 5 which were the rltec values predicted with the efficacious 500 mg by mouth twice-daily dosing of chloroquine 16 various dosing regimens were simulated but 2 are particularly notable the first was an oral loading dose of 1200 mg divided 800 mg then 400 mg on day 1 followed by 400 mg daily this regimen led to significantly higher rltec on day 1 333 day 3 551 and day 5 103 than those values demonstrated with chloroquine the second regimen was a loading dose of 800 mg 400 mg  2 on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily this was also associated with higher rltec values than chloroquine on day 1 3 and 5 corresponding to 210 389 and 854 respectively 18 the authors concluded that these data support the lower dose regimen because rltec values were significantly higher than those with the proven efficacious regimen of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily clinicians should note that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have half-lives of 40 days 19 and therefore short durations would likely provide prolonged courses of therapy this was exemplified in the pbpk modeling in which rltec values with hydroxychloroquine were predicted to still be above the targeted efficacy threshold on day 10 even with a 5-day course of therapy although these data are encouraging for the potential role of hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-2 we caution against solely relying on these data to support dosing regimens for patients the use of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily as the reference for efficacy is rational given initial reports from china 16 but it is important to note that this dosing still requires validation and the improved rltec values reported are largely driven by the finding that hydroxychloroquine was 76 times more potent than chloroquine in vitro although this enhanced potency may very well prove true as more data become available this report is counter to the relative potency demonstrated with the structurally similar sars-cov-1 strain in 2006 in which chloroquine was approximately 5 times more potent than hydroxychloroquine in addition a recently published study has demonstrated that the ec50 value for chloroquine is 113 m 3 similar to the value reported for hydroxychloroquine in the analysis by yao et al 18 because there are currently no efficacy data available for hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 additional consideration should be given to the optimal dosing strategy we use the following example to illustrate this point if one were to consider these 2 compounds to be equally potent identical ec50 values and utilize the pbpk data from yao et al 18 the 800 mg load 400 mg daily regimen for hydroxychloroquine would yield rltec values of 276 511 and 112 on day 1 3 and 5 respectively these rltec values would be slightly lower than those achieved with 500 mg by mouth twice daily of chloroquine on day 3 and significantly lower than those on day 5 suggesting the potential need for a higher dose to have similar activity although the 400 mg daily regimen is the most common regimen currently being assessed in clinical trials the rationale for that dose is currently unclear and at least 1 clinical trial in china is using a higher dose of 800 mg by mouth daily to this point gautret et al 20 recently published their initial experience on the impact of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine by mouth every 8 hours on viral eradication in patients with covid-19 the authors reported on 36 patients 20 hydroxychloroquine and 16 control who were covid-19 positive and able to have nasopharyngeal sampling for the first 6 days of therapy in the treated arm the investigators demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine 14 of 20 70 was superior to standard of care 2 of 16 125 p  001 in eradicating sars-cov-2 from the nasopharynx it is interesting to note that 6 patients were prescribed azithromycin to prevent bacterial super-infection and the investigators found that viral eradication was numerically superior in this subgroup 6 of 6 100 compared with those who received hydroxychloroquine alone 8 of 14 57 the authors concluded that azithromycin reinforced the sars-cov-2 viral load achieved by hydroxychloroquine although these data are intriguing certain limitations to this data set must be acknowledged first although viral eradication is an important endpoint the authors did not report clinical outcomes in these patients second the cohort initially contained 26 hydroxychloroquine patients but 6 of them were removed from the analysis due to early cessation of hydroxychloroquine therapy including 3 pcr-positive patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit icu 1 pcr-negative patient who passed away and 1 pcr-positive patient who discontinued hydroxychloroquine due to nausea finally the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy arm included patients with significantly higher viral loads represented by lower cycle threshold ct values than those who received combination therapy if the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy patients with ct values 23 are separated from those with ct values 23 there is a notable discordance in viral eradication rates 1 of 5 20 vs 7 of 9 78 with this latter number approaching the 6 of 6 demonstrated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy in which all patients had ct values 23 given this finding the small numbers in this study the lack of clinical outcomes presented the potential for additive toxicity with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and the desperate need to practice good antimicrobial stewardship during the covid-19 pandemic we would caution clinicians against using these data to support combination therapy despite all of the unknowns the initial experience in china is encouraging for the potential role of chloroquine or alternatively hydroxychloroquine for the management of covid-19 clinicians are encouraged to closely follow subsequent peer-reviewed publications from the ongoing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials because others have raised concerns regarding the apparent in vitro andor in vivo discordance witnessed with chloroquine in other viral infections 21 furthermore if hydroxychloroquine is utilized careful consideration for dose selection should be given in accordance with the aforementioned data as well as considerations for when to initiate during the course of illness lopinavir is a human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 protease inhibitor administered in fixed-dose combination with ritonavir lpvr a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor that boosts lopinavir concentrations lopinavir seems to block the main protease of sars-cov-1 inhibiting viral replication 22 in 2003 chu et al 23 evaluated a series of antivirals for in vitro activity against sars-cov-1 they reported lopinavir at 4 gml and ribavirin at 50 gml inhibited sars-cov-1 after 48 hours of incubation and that the agents were synergistic when used together 23 de wilde et al 24 later described the antiviral activity of lopinavir against sars-cov-1 and demonstrated an ec50 171  1 in vero e6 cells which is near the upper range of lpv plasma concentrations previously measured in patients with hiv 25 sheahan et al 5 evaluated the in vitro efficacy of lpvr in combination with interferon beta infb against mers-cov and found the addition of lpvr did not significantly enhance antiviral activity of infb alone ec50  160 vs 175 iuml respectively they also described the ec50 of lpvr 85 m and lpv alone 116 m suggesting similar activity to that described for sars cov-1 despite in vitro activity against mers-cov therapeutic doses of lpvr  infb in mice models failed to reduce virus titer and exacerbated lung disease 5 this is notable because this was the same study in which remdesivir demonstrated both more potent in vitro activity as well as in vivo efficacy however the in vivo animal data for mers-cov appears equivocal given that a nonhuman primate model demonstrated improved clinical and pathological features after lpvr treatment 26 a randomized controlled trial of lpvr and recombinant interferon-1b versus placebo is currently enrolling for patients with mers-cov which might help clarify the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and animal models 27 based on in vitro findings chu et al 23 utilized combination therapy with lpvr ribavirin and corticosteroids for any newly diagnosed patient with sars-cov-1 without acute respiratory distress syndrome ards starting in april 2003 patients receiving lpvr combination therapy n  41 were matched to historical patients receiving ribavirin plus corticosteroids n  111 and a significant reduction in the development of ards or death at 21 days was observed 24 vs 288 p  001 this was corroborated by an expanded case-control matched study of 75 lpvr-treated patients from the same center that demonstrated a significant reduction in pulse steroid use 273 vs 554 intubation 0 vs 11 and mortality 23 vs 156 among patients who received lpvr combination versus no lpvr respectively as initial therapy 28 more important the benefits of lpvr were only demonstrated in patients who received initial treatment with lpvr defined as initiation of drug at time of sars-cov-1 diagnosis there was no observed benefit when lpvr was added as rescue or salvage therapy death rate 129 vs 14 this compelling mortality difference in sars-cov-1 and continued investigation in mers-cov led to inclusion of lpvr in the chinese sars-cov-2 guidelines at a dose of 400 mg100 mg 2 capsulestablets by mouth twice a day for no more than 10 days even though to our knowledge no in vitro data for lpvr in sars-cov-2 exist 29 in pediatric patients weighing 1540 kg the recommended dose in the united states is 10 mgkg suspension by mouth twice daily there are 10 ongoing registered clinical trials in china korea thailand and hong kong evaluating lpvr as monotherapy or in combination with other antivirals eg ribavirin interferon beta-1b or traditional chinese medicine for treatment of covid-19 real-world data for treatment of covid-19 with lpvr are emerging young et al 30 reported outcomes of the first 18 patients infected with sars-cov-2 in singapore 5 of whom received lpvr monotherapy three patients had reduction in oxygen requirements after treatment initiation 2 deteriorated to respiratory failure two of 5 patients 40 experienced clearance of viral shedding on treatment and 4 of 5 80 experienced adverse events that precluded completion of the planned 14-day treatment course other published case reports or case series from korea and china comprising 6 total patients describe decreased viral load and clinical improvement after lpvr initiation these data are difficult to interpret in light of concomitant drug therapies varied time points of therapy initiation heterogeneous severity of illness amongst patients and the lack of comparator treatments 3133 finally early reports from wuhan have described some patients receiving lpvr in addition to other therapies including corticosteroids but clinical outcomes and adverse events are either not described or not delineated by treatment group 3436 most recently cao 37 et al reported the results of an open-label randomized trial comparing lpvr 400100 mg twice daily n  99 to standard care n  100 for the treatment of covid-19 pneumonia the primary endpoint was defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of 2 points on a 7-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality time until discharge and virologic response on repeat oropharyngeal swabs over the course of the study the median time from symptom onset to randomization was 13 interquartile range iqr 1116 days and this did not differ between the groups there was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement 16 iqr 1317 days vs 16 iqr 1517 days time from randomization until discharge 12 iqr 1016 days vs 14 iqr 1116 days or mortality 192  vs 250 absolute difference 58 95 confidence interval ci 173 to 57 between patients receiving lpvr and standard care when the 3 patients who died after randomization but before receiving lpvr were removed there remained no difference in mortality 167 vs 250 absolute difference 83 percentage points 95 ci 196 to 30 more important there was no difference between treatment arms in reduction of viral loads over time between the 2 groups with the available data it is difficult to assess whether lpvr has a role for the treatment of covid-19 either as monotherapy or in combination the data from sars-cov-1 are encouraging but this must be weighed against the inferior performance in mouse models against mers-cov the less potent in vitro activity compared with remdesivir and chloroquine for sars-cov-1 and limited data suggesting no advantage over standard care for sars-cov-2 more important it warrants comment that in the recent randomized controlled trial in covid-19 pneumonia the median time from symptom onset to initiation of therapy was 13 days and in the sars-cov-1 experience therapy appeared effective if started early but not as rescue andor salvage if used drug interactions must be screened and gastrointestinal toxicities including diarrhea nausea and vomiting and hepatotoxicity require close monitoring particularly because elevated aspartate transaminase or alt may exclude patients with covid-19 from clinical trials the lpvr tablets can be taken without regard to food but should not be crushed because this decreases systemic exposure solution should be used in patients who cannot receive intact tablets 38 nitazoxanide has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against sars cov-2 with an ec50 at 48 hours of 212 m in vero e6 cells 3 this potent activity is consistent with ec50 values for nitazoxanide and its active metabolite tizoxanide against mers-cov in llc-mk2 cells in which ec50 values of 092 and 083 m respectively have been demonstrated 39 nitazoxanide displays broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activity against influenza respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza rotavirus and norovirus among others in addition to coronaviruses 39 this broad-spectrum antiviral activity is believed to be due to the fact that the mechanism of action is based on interference with host-regulated pathways involved in viral replication rather than virus-specific pathways 39 due to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity nitazoxanide is being investigated for the management of influenza and other acute respiratory infections positive results were demonstrated in a phase 2b3 study for the outpatient management of influenza in which a dose of 600 mg by mouth bid of nitazoxanide was associated with a 1-day improvement in time to resolution of symptoms when compared with placebo p  008 40 three phase 3 randomized controlled trials in uncomplicated influenza have since been completed clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct01610245 march 2018 nct02612922 april 2018 and nct03336619 september 2019 although results are unavailable nitazoxanide failed to reduce the duration of hospitalization or the time to symptom alleviation in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial in patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses requiring hospitalization predominantly caused by respiratory viruses 41 although the in vitro activity of nitazoxanide against sars-cov-2 is encouraging more data are clearly needed to determine its role in the management of covid-19 tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits both membrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 il-6 receptors interleukin-6 which is secreted by monocytes and macrophages is one of the main drivers of immunologic response and symptoms in patients with cytokine-release syndrome crs although tocilizumab was first approved by the fda in 2010 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis it has gained traction in recent years for treatment of patients with crs following chimeric antigen receptor t-cell car t therapy as a corticosteroid-sparing agent 42 indeed it received fda approval for severe or life-threatening car t-associated crs in 2017 due to its efficacy and safety profile although criteria for grading crs severity varies by cancer center it has been proposed to administer tocilizumab to crs patients with any of the following oxygen requirement 40 hypotension responsive to fluids or a low dose of a single vasoactive agent or grade 2 organ toxicity as defined by the common terminology criteria for adverse events 43 interleukin-6 antagonism may make a patient more susceptible to bacterial infection and has been associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving chronic therapy with tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis in a case series of 53 adult patients with relapsed or refractory b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia grade 3 crs or higher was associated with increased risk of subsequent infection but it was unclear whether tocilizumab or corticosteroid use promoted this risk 44 there were no reported adverse events in the 60 tocilizumab-treated patients submitted to the fda for the crs indication which recommends a maximum of 4 doses for treatment 45 hyperinflammatory states and cytokine storming including elevated il-6 has been reported in severe covid-19 and were associated with increased mortality in patients in china 36 a preprint nonpeer reviewed case series of 21 patients treated with tocilizumab between february 5 and 14 2020 in china reported marked success including rapid resolution of fever and c-reactive protein decreased oxygen requirements and resolution of lung opacities on computerized tomography imaging 46 the authors state the patients all had routine treatment for a week before tocilizumab which was described as standard care according to national treatment guidelines including lopinavir methylprednisolone and other supportive care all patients had il-6 analyzed before tocilizumab administration with a mean value of 13238  27854 pgml normal 7 pgml it should be noted that in the united states il-6 monitoring is a send-out laboratory for most institutions with a turnaround time of 37 days no adverse events were described in the chinese cohort however long-term assessment was not done immunotherapy with tocilizumab is listed as a treatment option for severe or critical cases of covid-19 with elevated il-6 in the 7th edition of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china covid-19 diagnosis and treatment guide 29 the recommended dose is 48 mgkg or 400 mg standard dose iv once with the option to repeat a dose in 12 hours not to exceed a total dose of 800 mg there are 2 ongoing trials in china evaluating safety and efficacy of tocilizumab for patients with covid-19 pneumonia but none registered in the united states we anticipate that more data regarding tocilizumab use in patients with covid-19 will emerge and it will be imperative for clinicians to evaluate it closely the optimal timing of tocilizumab administration during the disease course is not yet defined nor is there a known il-6 threshold for progression to severe disease it is imperative to continue to follow the long-term outcomes in these patients to assess the risk versus benefit of tocilizumab similar to other severe respiratory tract infections there is significant interest and controversy surrounding the role of corticosteroids for the management of severe pneumonia due to coronaviruses the potential benefit of these agents to blunt the inflammatory cascade seen in severe disease needs to be carefully weighed against the concerns for secondary infections adverse events and other complications of corticosteroid therapy the data assessing the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive care for severe coronavirus sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 pneumonia are difficult to interpret given the retrospective observational nature of these analyses there is significant confounding by indication that is difficult to control or correct for in addition to limited sample sizes patients who receive corticosteroids have a higher severity of illness are more likely to require invasive interventions and are more likely to be receiving intensive care in addition there is significant heterogeneity with regard to timing of corticosteroid initiation which can significantly impact disease progression and likelihood of response all of these features lead to patients who receive steroids being at increased risk for poor outcomes in addition there is great variation in agent and dosage used which can impact both safety and efficacy therefore clinicians making any therapeutic decisions based on the literature for corticosteroids need to keep these considerations in mind the clinical data for use of corticosteroids in sars-cov-1 infections are mixed multiple analyses show no impact on outcomes 47 one report demonstrates decreased mortality in critically ill patients 48 and others have documented worse outcomes for patients receiving steroids including increased time to viral clearance 49 or an increase in the composite endpoint of icu admission or death 50 in mers-cov receipt of corticosteroids has been associated with a delayed time until viral clearance in a large cohort n  309 of infected patients 51 however this same data set showed a nonsignificant reduction in 90-day mortality in patients receiving corticosteroids adjusted odds ratio  075 95 ci 052107 after accounting for differences between the groups in a regression model accounting for time-varying exposures finally recent evidence in sars-cov-2 suggested a decrease in mortality in patients with ards with the receipt of corticosteroids 23 of 50 46 vs 21 of 34 62 without hazard ratio 038 95 ci 020072 52 as demonstrated the data for corticosteroids are inconsistent confusing and inconclusive although target patients in whom corticosteroids will improve outcomes may exist eg those with cytokine-related lung injury who may develop rapidly progressive pneumonia that population remains ill-defined 53 clinicians need to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of corticosteroids on the individual patient level this need for a risk-benefit assessment in individual patients and careful consideration of dose is exemplified in the covid-19 diagnosis and treatment guide from the national health commission of the peoples republic of china where the authors state based on respiratory distress and chest imaging may consider glucocorticoid that is equivalent to methylprednisolone 12 mgkgday for 35 days or less note that large-dose glucocorticoid suppresses immune system and could delay clearance of sars-cov-2 29 a recent consensus statement from the chinese thoracic society recommends a lower dose 051 mgkg per day methylprednisolone for 7 days in select patients after careful consideration of risks and benefits 53 randomized controlled trial data are urgently needed to clearly define the role of corticosteroids in covid-19 ribavirin a guanosine analog that terminates rna synthesis was first approved in the 1980s and has been used clinically for respiratory syncytial virus viral hemorrhagic fever and in combination with interferon for hepatitis c as mentioned previously see lpvr section it was evaluated against sars-cov-1 in 2003 and used clinically in combination with corticosteroids andor interferon in the absence of other treatment options however outcomes were either poor or ill-defined 54 55 the doses required for antiviral activity against sars range from 12 to 24 grams by mouth every 8 hours which are associated with excessive toxicity to patients 56 wang et al 3 evaluated the in vitro activity of ribavirin against sars-cov-2 and found an ec50 of 1095 m which was over 100 times less potent than remdesivir the risk of hematologic toxicity at high doses likely outweighs potential clinical benefit and therefore ribavirin was not considered a viable candidate for further investigation by the who research and development plan for sars-cov-2 given its lack of in vitro efficacy toxicity profile and poor outcomes interferons   may stimulate innate antiviral responses and are expected to have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 given the previously described activity demonstrated against mers-cov ec50 175 iuml however toxicities are substantial including severe cytopenias hepatotoxicity including fatality neuropsychiatric events and risk of developing fatal or life-threatening ischemia or infection particularly when combined with ribavirin this combination was not associated with improved mortality or enhanced viral clearance in a retrospective analysis of patients infected with mers-cov who were initiated on combination therapy within 13 days of icu admission 57 despite the limited to poor data chinese guidelines recommend ribavirin 500 mg iv 23 times daily in combination with lpvr or inhaled interferon- 5 million units nebulized twice daily as one of the standard treatment options for covid-19 various combinations of ribavirin interferon and other antiviral agents are currently being studied in several clinical trials based on the poor in vitro activity an absence of animal or human data supporting its use and a significant toxicity profile we recommend avoiding use of ribavirin in patients with covid-19 at this time although interferons may be useful as adjunctive care they pose a significant risk to critically ill patients and in the absence of supportive data they also cannot be currently recommended given their antiviral activity against influenza considerable attention has been paid to oseltamivir and to a lesser degree baloxavir as potential treatment options for covid-19 this was exacerbated by the initial report from huang et al 1 in wuhan where patients managed with covid-19 received oseltamivir in addition to broad-spectrum antimicrobials it is important to note that use of oseltamivir was not as targeted therapy of sars-cov-2 but rather driven by the lack of a knowledge of the causative pathogen at the time of treatment and the desire to empirically treat influenza the authors do not suggest the use of oseltamivir for covid-19 in that publication and there are no data that suggest in vitro activity of oseltamivir against sars-cov-2 in fact the only data assessing oseltamivir activity against coronaviruses demonstrated it to be ineffective at inhibiting sars-cov-1 even at a concentration of 10 000 ml 56 coronaviruses do not utilize neuraminidase and thus there is no enzyme to be inhibited by oseltamivir this would hold true for zanamivir peramivir or any other neuraminidase inhibitor agents similarly neither a defined mechanism nor in vitro data have suggested that baloxavir would demonstrate activity against sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses therefore given the critical need for these agents in the management of influenza and concern for drug shortages with oseltamivir these agents should be avoided in patients with covid-19 once influenza has been ruled out 
table 2 lists agents that are being investigated andor theoretically considered for the management of sars-cov-2-infected patients at this time no recommendation can be made for any of these agents in general they should be avoided without additional supporting evidence appropriate management strategies for patients with covid-19 are a rapidly evolving therapeutic challenge and the optimal agents if any to treat infection or prevent progression to critical illness remain ill-defined although certain agents listed in this review are encouraging and the potential benefit of therapy likely outweighs the relatively minor risk of adverse events from short-course therapy the evidence remains inconclusive and changes almost daily patient populations who warrant therapy and the timing of initiation of therapy need to be defined given that disease progression can occur rapidly in stable patients and that viral loads are highest early in the infection course the authors of this review opine that rapid initiation of therapy in high-risk populations patients who are hospitalized or outpatients who are at high risk of complications is rational and should be considered ideally in the context of a well-controlled adequately powered trial more important however this strategy is not without risk and needs to be weighed against potential adverse events that remain poorly defined and impending drug shortages with increases in use of these agents to help address these concerns careful consideration should be given to duration of therapy with many clinical trials and institutional protocols recommending 57 days for uncomplicated disease duration of therapy should be individualized to the patient and the progression of disease clinicians must continually monitor and adapt as new literature becomes available caution should be applied because the bulk of the available clinical data are uncontrolled not peer reviewed or even unpublished given these limitations it is critical that institutions and clinicians report their experiences with the management and treatment of covid-19 to the medical community so that we may further modify and optimize treatment recommendations and pathways
