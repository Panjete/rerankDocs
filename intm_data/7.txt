the current digital signature infrastructure adopts schemes that rely on the hardness of factoring or finding discrete logarithms in finite groups 12 18 24 given recent advances in physics which point towards the eventual construction of large scale quantum computers 1 these hard problems will be solved in polynomial time using shors algorithm 25 lattice-based coding-based and multivariate signatures are considered quantum resilient schemes in the q1 model 7 however either their exact security with respect to quantum attacks is still not clear 5 11 or their communicationstorage complexity is impractical to a multitude of applications eg megabyte keys for the matrices of mceliece-based cryptosystems 27 on the other hand hash-based digital signatures have moderately sized keys order of kilobytes and their quantum security relies solely on that of hash functions based on grovers algorithm they have been proven to offer simple quantum resilient security properties 26 note that the proofs in 26 follow the q1 model where no superposition queries to quantum oracles are allowed 7hash-based signature algorithms are comprised of two schemes an underlying signing scheme and an extension algorithm the former algorithm defines the main signing procedure where a key pair can be used to sign one lamport 19 winternitz one time signature scheme wots wots 8 14 or a few messages eg biba 21 hors 23 hors 22 pors 2 and fors 4 after which a new key pair should be generated to maintain security against forgery attacks more precisely the security of hash-based few time hbft signature schemes decreases after revealing each signature and hence their bit-security is given under the condition that re-keying is required after r signatures accordingly translating this constraint to acceptable attack models implies that a maximum of r queries are allowed to the signing oraclethe extension algorithm is a top level construction that employs several instances of underlying signing schemes ots and hbft in a merkle tree structure such an algorithm enables signing multiple messages where signatures are verified with one public key merkle root extension algorithms can be stateful such as merkle signature scheme mss 20 extended merkle signature scheme xmss 9 xmss 15 multi tree xmss xmssdocumentclass12ptminimal

we analyze the security of fors against adaptive chosen message adversaries we show that its bit security with respect to adaptive chosen message attacks decreases significantly when compared to its security in a non-adaptive setting we adopt the adaptive chosen message attack model defined by reyzin and reyzin 23 and used in the analysis of hors and porswe propose a hash chaining mechanism that binds the process of generating a message ors with signing it which eliminates the offline adversarial advantage and makes ors generation feasible only for the signing entity we apply the chaining scheme to fors and present dynamic forest of random subsets dfors a new hors variant that resists adaptive chosen message attacks we show that the bit-security of dfors with respect to adaptive chosen message attacks is more than that of fors by a factor of documentclass12ptminimal

in this section we present a detailed analysis of dfors with respect to weak-message attacks and r-target subset resilience adversaries more precisely since the proposed chaining technique does not allow an adaptive adversary who has knowledge of k to compute the orss of any message of their choice before asking the signing oracle for its signature dfors is essentially r-subset resilient hence our analysis focuses on its security when an adversary is given the signatures of r messagesweak-message attacks dfors inherits fors mitigation to weak-message attacks 6 because it specifies an independent key pool for each index in the ors consequently even if an ors element is repeated the corresponding revealed secret keys will be differentr-target subset resilience according to definition 3 we assume an adversary documentclass12ptminimal

 in this review the potential use of these glycan-based histo-bgs in the context of personalized medicine will be discussed as well as the technology suitable for determining them in a research as well as clinical settingii epitopes are based on repeating units of either linear or 16-branched n-acetyllactosamine chains fig 2d 41 42 43 the name of the blood group emerged from an abbreviation of individuality and thus represents an upper and a lower-case letter i both structures are ubiquitously expressed with the exception of the very rare adult i phenotype lacking branched i structures either on erythrocytes only or even tissue-wide depending on the type of mutation 23 44similar to other polylactosamines ii structures are substrates to various glycosyltransferases including sialyltransferases and abo and le bg transferases as described in the following for review see refs 32 45the biosynthesis of the antigens from abo and le histo-bgs is closely related although the responsible glycosyltransferases are expressed from several independent genes abo gene on chromosome 9 h-gene fut1 se-gene fut2 and le-gene fut3 on chromosome 19 34 37 for abbreviated as well as full names including linkage specificities and responsible genes of the fucosyltransferases fut see table 1 starting from type 1 lactosamine residues le-fut and se-fut are competing to generate an lea or type 1h epitope led respectively 46 47 fig 2a type 1h or se antigen is a substrate for the abo gene-encoded a or b transferase producing the a or b antigen if one of the active alleles is present furthermore type 1h can be fucosylated by le-fut generating the leb epitope lea and leb structures cannot be further modified whereas a and b antigens are again substrates to le-fut resulting in aleb and bleb antigens 6 28 48 49 this pathway takes place in secretory tissues and cells other than erythrocytes since type 1 structures are highly expressed in outer epithelial layers with higher degree of differentiation eg in the oral or gut mucosa and are substrates to se-fut 4 se-fut is active in about 80 of caucasians the so-called secretors table 1 if the le gene is inactive only the precursor structures lec type 1 precursor and led type 1h that are classified as part of the bg collection 210 3 are found in plasma or on red blood cells of non-secretors and secretors respectively 28 erythrocytes normally have no se-fut or le-fut expression 50 and bear abo antigens mainly on type 2 chains which are the preferred substrates for h-fut 4on type 2 structures lex antigens cd15 in alpha13-linkage to the subterminal glcnac are being generated by either the le-dependent alpha134-fut or one of the other alpha13-futs 28 fig 2b in addition to se-fut if expressed in the respective cell type the h gene-regulated h-fut will primarily synthesize type 2h structures which can be further modified by a or b transferases or alpha13-futs incl le-fut3 the action of this type of futs results in ley epitopes ie type 2 isomers of leb in analogy to the above-described pathway for type 1 chains in type 2 aley and bley will be the largest end products if all the respective glycosyltransferases are expressed in their active form 6 28 the terminal lebley a- or b-epitopes can usually not be further modified by elongation or branching the same applies to the subterminal lea or lex
6 51the antigens of the p1pk fors glob bgs and related collections are all gsls reviewed in 12 24 the classification of these antigens has been changed several times in the past the current state according to the isbt is listed in table 1 structurally gsls are composed of a lipophilic part containing a long chain fatty acid and a sphingosine anchored in the plasma membrane and a hydrophilic glycan head group fig 1 starting from lactosylceramide either pk antigen globotriaosylceramide cd77 is synthesized via the action of the a4galt gene-encoded galactosyltransferase leading to the globo-series gsl pathway or p1 antigen is synthesized via the action of the same enzyme following two other non-bg-related glycosyltransferases generating neolacto-series gsl fig 3 for p antigen production an active b3galnt1-gene is required the structures of the globo- and neolacto-series gsls act as precursors for gsl-attached abo le and hse epitopes as indicated in fig 3 if a null-allele of either a4galt or b3galnt1 is apparent in very rare cases globo-gsls cannot be produced 52 furthermore a rare variant of the a4galt enzyme is linked to the expression of nor antigens 53 the fors1 antigen was found in individuals with an activated gbgt gene which is normally not active in humans but in some non-primate animals 27 except for p1 antigen which is rbc-specific the expression of the other related antigens is common to many tissues and cell types and expression levels can vary during cell cycle and differentiation 12in addition to the blood group systems and collections as classified by isbt two more glycan histo-bgs should be mentioned here ie the high incidence antigen sda and the ttn system tn antigen as part of an o-linked mucin-type glycan is primarily a substrate for t-synthase a ubiquitously expressed beta3-galactosyltransferase responsible for t antigen o-glycan core 1 formation for review see ref 54 t antigen is furthermore identical with type 3 chains which can be further elongated andor decorated by other bg antigens fig 2csda antigen is included in the high incidence 901 series according to isbt classification due to its high prevalence in caucasians similar to the discrepancy of erythrocyte vs secretions phenotypes in le bg individuals having an rbc sda  phenotype may still display sda antigens in their secretions and especially urine for review see ref 26 the minimal antigenic structure as shown in fig 2e is shared by both sda and cad antigens which are assumed to be products of the same b4galnt gene-encoded beta4-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase however the latter resulting from a more active enzyme variant consequently sda  individuals have sda structures primarily on n-linked glycans whereas cad-individuals also express these on type 3 o-linked glycans and long-chain sialyl-paraglobosides 55the genetically determined repertoire of glycosyltransferases is the basis for an individuals histo-bg phenotype however genetic diversity with the  300 alleles found for the abo locus and  50 alleles for the h se and le loci each 25 together with zygosity gives rise to an enormous variation of the levels of antigen expression including weak phenotypes leading to blood grouping discrepancies 56 57 moreover in pregnant women individuals with different hematologic disorders and especially in newborns weak expression of histo-bg antigens on rbcs has been reported 57 58 the age-dependency of abo antigen expression on rbcs is connected to the expression of i antigen which is the major precursor of abo structures on rbcs 12 i antigen expression in rbcs is negligible at birth and reaches the full adult level by the age of 18 months 59 giving an example of the oncodevelopmental nature of histo-bg antigen expression 33 the expression levels of abose and le antigens can also vary tremendously within an adult individual over time 60 regulatory mechanisms of histo-bg-related glycogene expression such as microrna or transcription factor expression are now being studied 38 61the vast variability of the actual histo-bg phenotypes furthermore derives from the numerous interrelations between the respective biosynthetic pathways this is demonstrated by the close relationships between abose and le bgs as well as p1pk glob and fors in addition to their precursor chains ii and ttn fig 2ad another important modification which is however not directly related to blood groups is alpha23-sialylation of the terminal galactose prior to the action of a fut on type 1 or 2 chains producing sialyl-lea and sialyl-lex antigens respectively fig 4
 these combined histo-bg antigens are recognized for their role in the context of cancer as is discussed below interestingly sialyltransferases also compete with futs for the same substrates and can therefore have an impact on the expression levels of the inter-connected abo and le glycan bg antigens 12 the different levels of substrate specificities have an additional impact on the overall complexity of the biosynthetic network of histo-bg glycosyltransferases some antigens can be synthesized by more than one enzyme see hse and in some instances enzymes are not limited to only one type of acceptors see chain types 14 for se-fut or the various substrates of le-fut or one type of linkage s le-fut acting as alpha13 and alpha14-futtaken together various factors can have an impact on the final phenotype ie the presence of individual histo-bg glycans on a cell surface or in a body fluid obviously the various associations found between bg glycans and different diseases disease stages and health-promoting factors are making histo-bg glycans an intriguing topic in the field of personalized medicine as discussed in the following paragraphs in table 2 the major conclusions from selected epidemiological studies reporting on associations between different diseases and abo le and se histo-bgs are summarizedfor all the common and most rare bg phenotypes on rbcs no direct causative relationship is known between the bg null-alleles and inherited diseases 5 12 since glycans are known for their predominant role as recognition molecules in particular in infection the association of glycan histo-bg polymorphisms with various infectious diseases is not surprising many vertebrate species have maintained a functional ab gene however in humans roughly half of the population has o genotype resulting in a non-functional ab enzyme abo polymorphism has been linked to evolutionary adaptation as defense against inter- and intra-species infections since individuals produce antibodies against the non-self ab antigens after the exposure to these antigens originating from eg pathogens 62 masking of pathogen adhesion glycotopes by other glycans is another defense mechanism suggested 63 whereas microbial attachment sites on epithelial surfaces can support colonization histo-bg antigens on soluble glycans such as mucins or free oligosaccharides from human milk may serve as decoy receptors in pathogen defense 64 65 66 fig 1glycan epitopes including histo-bgs have an important role in host-pathogen interactions since glycans act as recognition sites for bacterial adhesins and secondly pathogens express surface epitopes to mimic those of the host to evade immune response as proposed for helicobacter pylori le antigens 14 remarkably h pylori is able to bind to the same antigenic structures on the hosts epithelial surface 91 h pylori is present in half of the world population and chronic infection is linked to gastritis peptic ulcer and gastric cancer with a high degree of heterogeneity in disease phenotypes 92 the bacterium is able to attach only to leb antigen without additional a or b epitopes and has therefore been proposed to be linked to bg o 91 however clinical data on the association of h pylori gastric cancer and abole bgs are contradictory table 2 a higher incidence of h pylori in o and a lower incidence in a-individuals have been reported in multiple studies 63 strikingly gastric cancer risk was higher in a bg incidence rate ratio 120 95 ci 102142 whereas peptic ulcer risk was found to be higher in o-individuals in a large population-based study 68 the link to le and se phenotype seems to be even more unclear for instance se status and h pylori infection have shown to be independent risk factors for gastric disease with a higher risk in non-se 81 although leb se seems to play a crucial role in h pylori adhesion 12 91 on tissue level h pylori infected patients with gastric ulcer were shown to have increased lea and loss of h and leb expression in their inflamed gastric mucosa 7 the authors claimed abo and le antigens to be good indicators for cellular alterations in the gastric epitheliumle- and se-positive women were found to have lower risk for urinary tract infections as compared to le-negative or non-se 75 since adhesins from uropathogenic escherichia coli recognize various globo-series gsls including fors1 p and especially the sialylated lke antigens in vitro 93 a masking function of antigens competing with sialylation in secretors ie leb and ab has been proposed 94 b and ab individuals in a pediatric cohort were found to be more susceptible to salmonellosis and various e coli types of infections meningitis sepsis pyelonephritis as compared to a or o individuals 71 in contrast shigella infections were more prevalent in o individuals 71 this relates to the higher susceptibility of o-individuals to infection by another shiga-toxin related bacterial strain ie e coli o157 67 the same study found p-negative individuals to be more likely to develop severe hemolytic uremic syndrome after infection possibly due to higher induction of tnf-alpha 67 pk lke and fors1 histo-bg antigens have been associated with other shiga toxin- and verotoxin-producing e coli strains stec and ehec 24 95 moreover pk-knockout mice showed no reaction to verotoxin administration whereas basal levels of pk expression were already lethal to wild-type mice 52shiga- and verotoxin-binding pk antigen is further found in human milk and may act as decoy receptor in breastfed infants that are at lower risk for diarrheal diseases as compared to formula-fed ones 96 the level of se-positive free oligosaccharides in human milk has also been positively correlated with eg protection against e coli-induced diarrhea in breastfed infants 97 similarly alpha-12-fucosylated oligosaccharides from human milk were associated with protection against campylobacter jejuni diarrhea 98 possibly due to their function as decoy receptors 99 in premature infants non- or low-se phenotype as well as genotype was furthermore associated with severe outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis or gram-negative sepsis 80expressing ab antigens on epithelia and in secretions as is the case in se-positive individuals might furthermore be protective against pneumonia caused by streptococci
63 78 this pathogen secretes glycosidases acting on type 2 chain a b and ley structures which are known virulence factors 100 secretors predominantly express type 1 chains shielded by a and b epitopes and might therefore be protected against pathogen adhesionnon-secretors have also been reported being more susceptible to infections caused by neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae
78 79 se le and ab bgs seem to also play a role in vibrio cholerae infection and disease severity 101 102pk p abh antigens and 2- and 3-fucosyllactose the latter two being milk oligosaccharides generated by se- and le-fucosyltransferases respectively may play a role in pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion 103 104 pk antigen also binds to adhesin p from streptococcus suis a pig pathogen that can cause meningitis in humans 105various studies have demonstrated the stimulation of antibody titers against bg antigens under different conditions of bacterial exposure thus supporting the hypothesis of an immunologic defense function of bg antigen non-expression 12 another indication for the implication of abo histo-bgs in immunological processes was given by the findings that the efficacy and the vibriocidal antibody response of cholera vaccines was lower in bg o compared to bg a individuals 106 107 therefore exploring the role of anti-bg antibody response and protection following specific vaccinations is of great interest as has been shown in a systems biology approach using glycan microarray analysis of immunoglobulin g preparations from different healthy populations 108 the pooled antibody preparations bound to various self-antigen ligands including especially glob fors1 ley bg a1 and bg b epitopes but also h2 and sialyl-lea in some cases the authors suggested a protective role for these self-antibodies by blocking bacterial attachment sites if released on epithelial surfacesin the context of viral infections associations of non-b as well as se genotype and phenotype with norovirus or rotavirus infection and gastroenteritis have been reported in numerous studies table 2 84 85 86 87 88 in addition a certain rotavirus genotype p11 that mainly infects neonates was found to attach specifically to saliva from neonates and infants but not adults due to high expression of polylactosamines ie the i antigen 109 different viral proteins from selected rotaviral genotypes were found to bind to either i epitopes or their type 1 isomers with or without internal lex of human milk oligosaccharides in a strain- and viral protein-dependent manner 64 consequently infectivity seems to be highly dependent on the virus genotype in interaction with the host ancestryethnicity and different histo-bgs for norovirus multivalent virus-like particle vaccines have therefore been proposed representing a broad set of viral genotypes and strains 110 interestingly anti-histo-bg but not immunoglobulin g or total antibody titers prior to the challenge with norovirus were positively correlated with protection against infection in placebo-recipients while in vaccinees the frequency of severe disease was lower with higher pre-challenge anti-histo-bg antibody titers 111 for the development of efficient vaccines against norovirus and rotavirus individualized approaches addressing all the relevant factors such as virus genotype the specific particles and adjuvants used in the vaccine and their interaction with the histo-bg antigens and anti-histo-bg antibodies of the recipients will be of particular interest in the futureo-bg was associated with resistance towards severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 112 se phenotype has been linked to other respiratory virus diseases including influenza rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus and echovirus 89 non-secretor genotype and phenotype are also associated with protective aspects in hiv such as reduced infection risk p  029 90 and slower disease progression p  001 113 likewise pk expression has been shown protective against hiv-1 infection in vitro as compared to p phenotype 114 the role of the p1pk bg in hiv infection is reviewed in ref 115 in contrast p antigen might be implicated in parvovirus b19 infection shown as its primary receptor 116bgs have also been associated with parasitic diseases table 2 in particular bg-o is a recognized genetic factor for a lower risk of severe malaria 72 the high percentage of o-individuals in malaria-endemic regions supports the hypothesis for a selective advantage of having bg o 13 furthermore the incidence of schistosome infection and disease severity has been linked to a-bg 69since histo-bg glycans are recognized for their role as oncodevelopmental antigens 33 and are moreover linked to tissue differentiation stage 4 it is not surprising that changes in their expression in the context of malignancies have been described 30 117  and more recently other glycosylation changes in cancer for extensive reviews see refs 15 118 119 moreover epidemiological studies found a decreased risk of various types of cancers in bg o and an increased risk in bg a as found in a meta-analysis 70 table 2 however in another meta-analysis no significant association was found when comparing o vs non-o bgs except for exocrine pancreatic cancer or  053 and 95 ci 033083 for bg-o vs non-o 73 further associations were found for le and se genotypes with breast cancer susceptibility and axillary lymph nodes metastasis respectively 76in clinical samples an increase of either incompletetruncated precursor structures t tn pk h ii type 1 chain or de novo expressed cancer antigens ie increased sialyl-leax fig 4 or fors1 p leb se and a antigens in otherwise null-allelic individuals is observed in various cancer types depending on the cancer stage 15 120 121 accordingly sialyl-tn is a recognized tumor marker and has been proposed as a target for the design of anticancer vaccines 122 however with limited success to date 123 sialyl-leax appear to play a role in later tumor stages and especially in metastasis 15 notably fut3 le and alpha23-sialyltransferase transcription and sialyl-leax antigen expression was shown to be upregulated in h pylori infected patients with early onset gastric carcinoma 124 moreover sialyl-lea ca19-9 is elevated in various types of gastrointestinal carcinomas and is an approved prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer therapy however in le-positive patients only since le-negative individuals do not express an active alpha14-fut sialyl-leaca19-9 serum levels are significantly lower or even non-detectable in pancreatic cancer patients with null-allelic le-gene 17another significant glycomic bg antigen change in cancer is a loss of a and b antigens in premalignant or malignant and metastatic tissue of otherwise a- or b-positive individuals 120 125 126 127 this switch has furthermore been linked to enhanced cellular motility and poor prognosis 117 the ab expression loss goes along with a higher abundance of the precursor structure i antigen in carcinomas from secretors whereas cancerous tissue from non-secretors experiences a lower i antigen expression 121 moreover an increased distribution of h antigen throughout all the layers of malignant tissue as compared to a more restricted pattern in normal mucosa has been found 126 128 analogously alpha12-fut activity from both se- and h-gene encoded enzymes were higher in rectal carcinomas than in normal tissue 129 interestingly seh-antigens were found in cecal tumors from se- as well as non-se patients while being absent in normal tissues of non-secretors a very recent investigation of cyst fluid and tissue from ovarian tumors has shown remarkable differences in abo bg antigen expression between different tumor stages and subtypes 130 by using mass spectrometry average compositions of fucosylation abo and le antigens and sialylation of mucin-type glycans the authors were able to distinguish three groups of samples i low-grade low malignant potential carcinomas and benign mucinous ii all serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas and iii serous benign samples again non-secretor samples were exceptions due to a genetically determined lower expression of bg epitopes on epitheliathe described glycomic changes in cancer have a potential as therapeutic vaccine targets including histo-bg antigens 16 131 moreover abo bg was demonstrated as a possible parameter for detecting responders to a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine 132 compared to bg aab participants bg o and b patients experienced enhanced survival after vaccination especially if they developed an antibody response against the fors1 antigen this was explained by the authors by the presence of fors1 in the poxviral vector used for the vaccine showing structural similarity to the a-antigen if verified the conclusions drawn from this and similar studies could open an invaluable opportunity for an effective immunization strategy in a blood-group specific manner by designing vaccines with bg epitopes complementary to the bg of the recipients who would thereby develop an enhanced immune responsein summary malignancy-associated changes of histo-bg glycans can be different in individuals with different genetic histo-bg backgrounds and may even be tumor stage- and subtype-specific revealing them as promising biomarkers for early cancer diagnostics as vaccine targets and as relevant factors to include in personalized oncotherapeutic approachesassociations between abo and especially the non-se phenotype or genotype with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as crohns disease primary sclerosing cholangitis chronic pancreatitis and type 1 diabetes have been reported 21 22 82 83 in addition childhood asthma was found to have a higher incidence in secretors with bg o andor le-negative phenotype 77 a possible explanation for the higher susceptibility to crohns disease in non-secretors is the link via gut microbiota intestinal microbiome composition differs between healthy se and non-se individuals as well as between different abo phenotypes among secretors 133 134 moreover perturbations in gut microbiota metabolism and other factors of the host-microbial environment in non-secretors and fut2 heterozygous individuals with crohns disease have been reported 135 fucosylation in the gut which is primarily mediated by fut2 and can be induced by certain gut bacteria via yet unknown mechanisms has a central role in the host-microbe symbiosys and can suppress pathogens 136 interestingly host fucose utilization by specific microbes is only down-regulated in non-se mice if fed a glucose-rich polysaccharide-deficient diet demonstrating an intense interaction between host genetics diet and gut microbiome 137 notably gastrointestinal malignancies in particular colorectal cancer have also been linked to gut microbiota composition 138intriguingly a previously unrecognized regulatory role of histo-bg antigens in inflammatory adhesion processes has been proposed due to a strong correlation of the abo locus with plasma concentrations of the soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 sicam-1 139 moreover the abo locus was associated with diabetes type 2 and e-selectin levels besides sicam-1 levels 140 in addition a lower risk of cardiovascular and associated diseases has been found for bg o individuals and linked to bg antigens on platelet glycoconjugates as recently reviewed 74 interestingly bg o individuals have lower levels of the blood clotting factors von willebrand and fviii due to their shorter plasma half-life 141in addition to cancer-related changes in ii antigen expression mentioned above a rare disease association has been reported for the adult i phenotype a correlation was found with congenital cataracts in certain kindreds 44 this has been putatively explained by a direct effect of the lack of branched type 2 polylactosamines resulting from a certain null-allelic gene variant of the i-antigen producing enzyme in the human lens epithelial cells 23 38 44some indications do exist that variants of the t-synthase gene generating t antigen are associated with susceptibility to iga nephropathy 142a downregulation of the b4galnt2 gene resulting in strong reduction of sda antigen expression in the colon and a concomitant increase of sialyl-lex expression is observed in colon cancer and might offer a promising opportunity in cancer therapy in the future 143as defined by the us food and drugs administration personalized medicine is the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics needs and preferences of a patient during all stages of care including prevention diagnosis treatment and follow-up 144 as briefly demonstrated by the example of the interaction of an individuals se status and gut microbiota histo-bgs might play a significant role already at the early stage of disease prevention another example is the various histo-bg glycans in human milk which are suggested to provide double protection to the breastfed child via their prebiotic and their antimicrobial activity in the gut 145 the decoy function of milk glycans in particular the highly abundant free oligosaccharides and mucin glycans offers a yet underexamined possibility for a novel preventive and therapeutic antibiotic strategy emerging high-throughput analytical technologies such as glycan microarrays multiplexed capillary electrophoresis or matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization maldi mass spectrometry ms will pave the way for the discovery of such novel bioactive compounds 64 65 146 147traditionally bg phenotyping is performed via targeted immunological assays using antisera lectins or monoclonal antibodies with or without staining on body fluids or tissues to determine the specific antigenicities 41 121 130 148 149 an immunoassay is also used for the determination of ca19-9 sialyl-lea levels in clinics 17 genotyping glycosyltransferase transcript analysis as well as standard proteomic techniques are currently being increasingly used also in the context of bg-typing 27 130 and do therefore comply with the requirements of modern personalized medicine furthermore they might be useful for patient stratification in settings where the genetic histo-bg background in combination with the natural anti-bg antigen antibodies plays a role such as vaccine efficacy studies the reverse abo-typing method developed by muthana and colleagues by using only 4 l of serum with glycan arrays was proven as particularly useful since it enabled retrospective bg typing without having whole blood samples available 132our current knowledge on the significance of histo-bgs in the context of disease as summarized in 5 6 is thus far mainly based on observational studies stratifying patients and controls by their blood type and showing associations with disease or disease stages table 2 information on the underlying mechanisms is very limited to date possibly due to the extremely reductionistic approach that emerged from transfusion medicine ie grouping individuals into a few categories deduced from their serological phenotype table 1 table 2 however the knowledge of a patients rbc pheno genotype or glycosyltransferase expression is only indicative for the final complex glycomic profile 62 especially if taking into account the vast tissue- and disease-specific variations of the histo-bg antigens their precursors and conjugates as well as interactions between different bgs as discussed in 2 4 thus simultaneous mapping of glycans from different histo-bgs next to the information on their carriers would provide the increased degree of comprehensiveness that is required to investigate the mechanisms behind the bg-to-disease associations presented abovemodern glyco-analytical techniques such as ms and liquid chromatography are in principle capable to provide this type of information on multiple levels1semi-quantitative determination of terminal glycosylation including histo-bg glycans as well as sialylation the levels of which appear to be inter-related2mapping of the overall glycome by furthermore providing information on the core glycan structures bearing the terminal bg glycans ie n- or o-glycans or the glycan portion of the gsl-based bg structures3determination of the proteinpeptide or lipid carrier
thus instead of just assigning samples to a limited set of categories as based on traditional or genetic bg typing advanced glyco-analytics will enable an unprecedented insight into the vast complexity and variety of structures fig 1 reflecting the underlying complex biological processes therefore glycomic together with glycoproteomic and glycolipidomic technologies should be further refined to allow unambiguous isomer-specific structural characterization and optimally quantitation of histo-bg glycans that have high potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in the context of both infectious and non-communicable diseases currently applied glyco-analytical techniques in the field of biomarker discovery from cancer tissues are presented in ref 150 major progress in glycomic approaches distinguishing linkages andor different monosaccharide species has been made recently in the field of n- and o-glycomics 151 152 however glycomics of histo-bgs has been neglected in the last years except for some few rather targeted approaches 153 154 155 in a very recent study traditional targeted techniques in combination with liquid-chromatography-msms were successfully applied showing great potential of mucin-type histo-bg glycans for ovarian tumor staging and classification not only from tissues but also from cystic fluid 130 glycomic approaches on only minute amounts of preferably non-invasively acquired patient samples such as saliva tears milk urine or feces 66 156 157 158 159 will be of particular use in the context of early diagnosis and population-wide screeningthe discovery of novel functions of histo-bgs by applying high-end technologies is warranted interestingly the spatial organization of abo antigen patches on rbcs from a b and o individuals was shown to differ in bg-specific manner resulting in higher or lower binding of sialic acid-binding proteins siglecs to sialic acid-rich clusters that are co-expressed nearby the abh regions 160 the authors claimed having found a novel function of abh antigens ie as indirect stabilizers of other glycan-protein interactions further research is warranted to reveal the function relevance of such multi-compound complexes involving the concerted binding of glycans in a multivalent mannerfinally a combination of the different omics techniques including glycomics will likely enhance the performance of the diagnostic and prognostic approaches 15 and pave the way for a successful translation into clinics as a first example in a pioneering combined genomics-glycomics study potential epigenetic regulatory factors of le-fut fut3 next to other futs were proposed on the basis of plasma protein n-glycome 161 studies combining genomic proteomic metabolomic and glycomic data containing histo-bg antigen information of different body fluids andor tissues could help revealing the mechanisms behind the above described disease associations and may provide improved disease biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets in the futurethe authors declare no conflict of interestaccording to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv coronaviruses are members of the sub-family coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales coronavirinae consists of four genera groups -coronavirus -coronavirus -coronavirus and -coronavirus 12 recently these groups are divided in terms of phylogenetic clustering while before they were sorted based on serology all viruses of nidovirales order are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses where within this the coronaviridae has the most significant identified rna genomes containing approximately 30 kilobases kb genomes on the other hand all coronaviruses have animal origin 2 3 table 1
below shows that the four genera of coronaviruses originated from animalsthe hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e are coronaviruses that cause mild infections in humans on the other hand sads-cov which has swine as an intermediate host role does not show any evidence of infections in humans hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 are both coronaviruses and are also mostly harmless to the human body that has a rodent-borne origin hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were isolated nearly 50 years ago while hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were identified in 2003 coronaviruses have not considered as highly pathogenic until the outbreak of sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 the spread of sars-cov in china guangdong indicated that a coronavirus was transmitted from bats to an intermediate host like market civets and from there to the human host while the outbreak of mers-cov in the middle east countries also came from bats to dromedary camels as an intermediate host and then it was transmitted to human 4 5 6 7 8 these viruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections including fever dizziness and coughon the 12th of december 2019 a new virus form of coronaviridae was reported in china wuhan the outbreak was associated again with intermediate hosts like reptilians while the natural host was assumed as bats this novel virus was designated at first as wh-human 1 and was referred after that as covid-19 by the who covid-19 was characterized by two members of -coronavirus human-origin coronavirus sars-cov tor2 and bat-origin coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 while intensive studies show that it was most closely related to the bat-origin coronavirus 9 as a result of the above discussion the primary assumption was set as the natural host of covid-19 is the bat which infects the human population with a domestic intermediate host figure 1
shows the animal origins of the human coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and covid-19explicitly stating if we analyze the environmental origin of covid-19 then we adopt the hypothesis that says that infected bats may spread the disease these bats of genus rhinolophus are mainly in the area of shatan river valley domestic animals like snakes in that area are hunted for the food market in wuhan which had an intermediate host role in the transmission finally this virus spillover from the intermediate hosts to cause several diseases in human a virus that started with an endemic pathogenic behavior in china wuhan reaches somehow to a pandemic point worldwidein this study we give brief information about coronaviruses and introduce the genera of covid-19 we explain the transmission from the natural host to the intermediate one and from there to the human host the mathematical model in section 2 shows the spread from animal to human and human to human we noticed in our model that the transmission risk from human to human is higher and more dangerous than the effect from animal to human in the end the study reveals that the infected class who do not know they are infected because of late recognized symptoms is the major problem of a pandemic spread worldwidemany research areas in biology or medicine are attractive topics for scholars engaging in applied mathematics since mathematical modeling has an essential role in understanding the dynamics of many diseases and biological phenomena over the years biological models have been formulated mathematically 10 11 12 13 mainly studies are restricted to integer-order differential equations however it is seen that many problems in biology as well as in other fields like engineering finance and economics can be formulated successfully by differential equations with piecewise constant arguments 14 15 16 17 in mathematical modeling for an overlapping species population it is convenient to use differential equations on the contrary for a non-overlapping species one it is suitable to use difference equations 14 however there are some dynamics in the environment which combine the tools of both differential-difference equations concerning time t for such biological events it is preferred to construct models of differential equations with both continuous and discrete-time relevant studies that have considered the discrete and continuous-time effects as differential equations with piecewise constant arguments are given in 17 19 20 21the question of whether the coronavirus is used as a biological weapon or not is out of our primary objective in the paper however this question was under consideration for the plague disease 22we consider here the pandemic infection that occurs when the virus is transmitted to the human body from the intermediate host and continues to spread from human-to-human the first three equations on the system show an si susceptible-infected model to explain the transmission from human-to-human where s is the susceptible class c
1 is the infected class which does not know that they are infected because of the late occurred symptoms of covid-19 and c2 represents the infected class that knows they are infected the spillover from the intermediate infected class m to the human host s denotes a predator-prey mathematical model while for the transmission from the natural host n which is the bat population to intermediate host m is a host-parasite model of holling type ii thus the mathematical model of this biological phenomena is modeled as follows1dsdtstr1p1st1c1tst2mtst1mtstdc1dtc1tr212c1t111stc1tc1tc1t212mtc1tdc2dtc2t13c2tc1t11st22mtdmdtmtr314mt2mtftntdndtntr415ntgtntwhere2ftmt1hemtandgtmt1hemtrepresent the holling type ii functions all the parameters in 1 belong to  and t is the integer part of t  0  the susceptible s is composed of individuals that have not contacted the infection but can get infected through contact with the humans that do not know they are infected and from the intermediate hosts r1 is the population growth rate of the susceptible population and

1 who do not know they are infected figure 2-a represents the transmission of the infection that occurs in epidemic form in some areas however it spreads intensively to pandemic phenomena worldwide and covers almost the susceptible class here we assume that the screening rate in the hospitals before the symptoms appear is around 1 figure 2-b shows the graph when the symptoms appear late so that the awareness of the infection is low in this case the endemic spread starts earlier and might be uncontrolled
figure 3

1203 to compare the difference between figure 2b and figure 3b it is seen that to be aware of the symptoms in the early stages is an essential parameter that affects the speed of the transmission in section iv the rate of screening was discussed intensively and it was shown that  is one of the essential control parameters and c

2 that knows they are infected it is seen that the infected class that do not know they are infected is higher than the class that is determined as c2 which is the infected class who is tested as positive this means that the spread of transmission from human to human occurs mainly from the c
1 which should be controlled with the parameters

2 and 
figure 5
shows a diagram of the population classes of 5 it is seen that the natural host and the intermediate host has a stable dynamical system in the habitat in contrast they have only a role as hosts in the transmission of the coronavirus the pandemic spread undergoes when the infection is transmitted from human to human the intermediate host animal shows only an endemic spread which should be considered as a minor role in this dynamical structure
figure 6
a-d show the relation of the susceptible class st and the c
1t class who do not know they are infected we increase the screening rate in each graph to 1 5 10 and 20 respectively it is noticed that the effect of c
1t relative to st decreasesfinally figure 7
a and 7 b shows the rate of recognition of the dynamical behavior related to the susceptible class st and the c
1t class who do not know they are infected we found that the recognition through health organizations and media are highly operative points to stop the pandemic spread and return it to its endemic form at first we considered the rate of recognition as i04 and after that i06 for i12 which are shown in figure 7 a and b respectivelyin this paper we first review the reasons for the spread of coronaviruses from the natural host to the human host after that we established a model of the novel coronavirus which is known as covid-19 described by differential equations with piecewise constant arguments the model is constructed in alignment with important biological and medical reasons we divided the model into five sub-classesthe susceptible class sthe infected class c
1 that does not know they are infected since specific symptoms do not appearthe infected class c
2 that knows they are infected because of some symptoms such as respiratory and intestinal infections including fever dizziness and cough appearedthe intermediate domestic host m that has a transmission role from the natural host to the human hostthe natural host n that are bats of genus rhinolophus

we considered in this study the pandemic infection case animal to human and human to human therefore the first three equations in the model show human to human transmission while the spillover from the intermediate infected class to the human host denotes a predator-prey mathematical model and the transmission from the natural host to intermediate host is a host-parasite model of holling type iithe main results are then stated and proved in section 3 we analyzed the local and global stability of the co-existing equilibrium point via the linearized stability theorem and a lyapunov function respectively theorem 2 and theorem 3 show the stability results when the natural host population is under control but the screening of c
1 is not high we deduced that the necessary reproduction numbers r
01  1 and r
02  1 that shows the transmission potential of the sc1 and the mn classes respectively we concluded that among the human hosts those who do not know they are infected are the control class in the spread in contrast between the animal hosts the intermediate class plays a dominant role since that class has an essential role in transmitting the disease from animal to human we noticed that c
1 can decrease if there might be a periodic screening and awareness of information transmitted through media for the susceptible class it is more important to keep the population rate per year non-infected the transmission of the virus to the offspring would reach an uncontrollable phenomenon worldwidelater in section iv we incorporated the allee function at a discrete-time t we analyzed both weak and strong allee effect and obtained that screening for possible inflectional cases in discrete time is an essential control parameter to support both allee functions in stabilizing the effect of the spread we emphasized that the susceptible class and the classes who do not know they are infected are the central populations that affect the allee function in stabilizing the spread of transmission while it is the priority to keep human non-infected the other essential aim is to detect the infected class before the symptoms appearin section v we obtained that the system demonstrates a neimark-sacker bifurcation under specific conditions it is seen that the basic reproduction number r
01 and the natural host has an essential role in the mentioned bifurcationin the end numerical simulations along with graphical illustrations are presented to examine the validity of our theoretical findings we focused on two control parameters which are  the screening rate and ii12 the rate of recognition we obtained that if the screening percentage stays low the spread of infection reaches to a pandemic form since the group who do not know they are infected is the significant risk group in transmission the rate of recognition shows the behavioral act of the civilians considering the daily information from the health organizations it is seen that any discrete-time of health care protections would expand the pandemic spread over timethe results of this paper studied a biomedical model that describes the character of coronavirus the analysis of the model as well as specific qualitative properties are discussed throughout the paper our study is based on mathematical interpretations and consistent with biological and medical assumptions we believe that our results are essential and of great significance for further investigations

de 20e eeuw kende drie influenzapandemien3 in tabel 1 zijn enkele bijzonderheden van deze pandemien weergegeven de spaanse griep veroorzaakte vooral sterfgevallen onder jonge volwassenen sommige onderzoekers geven aan dat er voor dit merkwaardige fenomeen nooit een goede verklaring gevonden is terwijl anderen suggereren dat een cytokinestorm aan dit verschijnsel debet is geweest eenvoudig gezegd komt deze hypothese erop neer dat een op hol geslagen afweersysteem waarbij vooral wordt gedacht aan t-lymfocyten binnen korte tijd fatale schade toebrengt aan het lichaam en dat niet zozeer het virus zelf hiervoor verantwoordelijk is dit zou verklaren dat vooral jonge gezonde volwassenen met een optimaal functionerend afweersysteem zo snel en zo zwaar werden getroffen

in 1997 werden in hongkong achttien volwassenen besmet met het vogelgriepvirus h5n1 van hen overleden er zes deze besmetting viel samen met een uitbraak van de vogelgriep binnen drie dagen slaagde hongkong er destijds in om de volledige kippenpopulatie te vernietigen circa 15 miljoen kippen experts zijn het erover eens dat deze actie mogelijk destijds een pandemie heeft voorkomenin februari 2003 waren er opnieuw twee humane besmettingsgevallen in hongkong waarvan er n fataal verliep medio 2003 brak in azi de vogelgriep uit onder diverse diersoorten niet alleen vogels en kippen werden getroffen door het h5n1-virus maar ook tijgers en luipaarden in een dierentuin in thailand nadat ze gevoed waren met verse kipkarkassen terwijl de vogelgriep zich steeds verder uitbreidde over azi en europa waarschijnlijk via trekvogels kwamen er vanaf januari 2004 steeds meer alarmerende berichten over menselijke slachtoffers van 2003 tot juni 2010 zijn er 500 besmettingen gedentificeerd 300 patinten 60 zijn overleden4
vanwege deze zonotische besmetting ontstond eind jaren negentig van de vorige eeuw het idee dat de wereld zich zou moeten voorbereiden op een nieuwe pandemie de who riep de lidstaten op om pandemic planning te starten er werd een indeling in zes fasen gemaakt waarbij de verspreiding van het influenzavirus het criterium voor verhoging van de alarmfase dicteerde tabel 2 de dreiging van de vogelgriep met humane infecties van een aviair influenzavirus zonder mens-op-mensbesmetting was daarin fase 3

ook de nederlandse overheid startte de voorbereiding op een mogelijke pandemie de gezondheidsraad bracht een aantal adviezen uit over antivirale middelen vaccinatie en andere preventieve maatregelen tabel 3 er werden draaiboeken ontwikkeld antivirale middelen aangekocht voor een derde van de bevolking de ontwikkeling van een nhg-standaard pandemie werd gestimuleerd en bedrijven kregen het advies zich voor te bereiden op continuteit van de ondernemingen bij grote uitval van personeel bij een pandemie

het ministerie van vws richtte binnen het rivm het centrum voor infectieziektebestrijding cib op er kwamen afspraken voor het samenroepen van een outbreak management team omt met deskundigen uit de publieke gezondheidszorg microbiologen infectiologen en behandelaars afhankelijk van het soort dreiging kan de samenstelling van een dergelijk team wisselen maar alle contactgegevens van de deskundigen zijn bekend de eerste keer dat dit omt met spoed bijeenkwam was tijdens de sars-epidemie in 1997 in nederland viel die samen met de h7n7-infectie van kippen de kippenpest daarbij werden 87 mensen besmet en viel n dode te betreuren na ruiming van miljoenen kippen stopte de besmetting van de kippen in nederland ook bij de verspreiding van de q-koorts werd vaak het omt bijeengeroepenbij een pandemie is de minister van vws verantwoordelijk voor de bestrijding het omt van het rivm geeft vertrouwelijk advies aan het bestuurlijk afstemmingsoverleg bao dat de minister adviseert het advies van het bao is openbaar vervolgens beslist de minister over te nemen maatregelen toen bij de kippenpest bleek dat bij de ruimers de infectie met het influenza-a-virus h7n1 kon leiden tot conjunctivitis adviseerde het omt om oseltamivir profylactisch te geven aan de mensen die langer dan een bepaalde periode op een besmet bedrijf verbleven nadat dit advies gemplementeerd was ontstonden weinig nieuwe gevallen onder de ruimersvaccinproducenten bereidden de massale aanmaak van een pandemisch vaccin voor vanwege de lange productietijd van zes maanden en de registratievereisten voor een nieuw vaccin maakten zij op basis van het h5n1-virus een vaccin een dergelijk vaccin zou al vr een epidemie gegeven kunnen worden om het immuunsysteem te primen bij het vaststellen van het definitieve pandemische virus zou dan slechts een tweede iets gewijzigd vaccin nodig zijn om het voorbereide systeem te boosteren de registratie zou dan snel kunnen verlopen zodat daarmee geen tijd verloren zou gaan de gezondheidsraad bereidde begin 2009 een advies daartoe voorin maart 2009 kwam de eerste melding van een nieuw influenza-a-virus h1n1 uit californi dit virus leek op een influenzavirus dat bij varkens voorkwam min of meer gelijktijdig kwamen er berichten uit mexico over een forse toename van pneumonien onder jonge mensen eind april bleek dat het californische virus ook de oorzaak was van die mexicaanse uitbraak na typering van het virus bleken er elementen van humane aviaire en varkensinfluenza in voor te komen op 24 april kwam de eerste pandemiewaarschuwing van de who het virus zou later genoemd worden naar de eerste vindplaats influenza acalifornia72009 h1n1v maar de termen mexicaanse griep swine flu en nieuwe influenza h1n1 bleven internationaal in omloop in dit stuk is gekozen voor de term mexicaanse griepde ontwikkelingen in nederland zijn weergegeven in tabel 4 na de eerste melding door de who werd op 27 april fase 4 afgekondigd vanwege het bestaan van kleine clusters van mens-op-mensbesmettingen het rivm riep op 29 april het omt bijeen diezelfde dag werd de pandemie door de who opgeschaald naar fase 5 omdat de clusters groter bleken dan eerder voorzien het omt adviseerde om de mexicaanse griep meldingsplichtig te maken en om maatregelen te nemen om verspreiding in nederland te beperken iedere mogelijke besmetting moest door een test aangetoond worden de patint en diens gezinsleden werden behandeld met oseltamivir en mochten een week lang niet buiten komen vooral de ggd in amsterdam werd overstelpt met reizigers die in een vliegtuig in de buurt van een mogelijke patint hadden gereisd

op 30 april 2009 werd het eerste geval van mexicaanse griep in nederland aangetoond de commissie van de gezondheidsraad die een advies over eventuele prepandemische vaccinatie had voorbereid kwam op 8 mei bijeen en adviseerde de minister om vaccin voor de gehele bevolking te kopen in het gezondheidsraadadvies van 2000 over pandemische vaccinatie was dit plan al voorbereid uit proeven met het prepandemische h5n1-vaccin was gebleken dat minstens twee vaccinaties nodig zouden zijn en dat deze liefst ook een hulpstof zouden bevatten omdat niemand in de bevolking eerder met een nieuw pandemisch virus in aanraking zou zijn gekomen was een geadjuveerd vaccin tweemaal gegeven de beste garantie op een beschermende titerin mexico en ook in de verenigde staten breidde de griep zich uit beelden van overvolle ziekenhuizen en het stilleggen van alle activiteiten in mexico-stad domineerden het nieuws eind mei verschenen de eerste epidemiologische gegevens uit mexico waarbij de meest opvallende bevinding was dat vooral jongvolwassenen risico op complicaties en zelfs sterfte liepen5 de sterftecurve had een w-vorm met een piek op midvolwassen leeftijd naast de pieken bij kinderen en ouderen net als tijdens de spaanse griep in 1918 de traditionele u-curve van ziekenhuisopnames en sterfte tijdens een gewone griepepidemie waarbij vooral kinderen en ouderen slachtoffers waren werd nu niet aangetroffen op basis van de toen beschikbare gegevens kondigde de who op 11 juni fase 6 af dat betekende dat het virus wereldwijd verspreid was de fasering had geen betrekking op de ernst van de ziekte langzamerhand bleek dat de mexicaanse griep mild was ouderen vooral geboren vr 1957 leken relatief beschermd wellicht door eerder verworven immuniteit tegen dit h1n1-virus de meeste risicogroepen voor complicaties van een griepvirus betreffen juist oudere mensen de sterftecijfers vielen daardoor mee maar sterfte onder kinderen en jongvolwassenen had grote impact in de publiciteitin nederland was het aantal gevallen nog steeds beperkt er waren enkele uitbraken na bezoek aan evenementen maar de virologische laboratoria de ziekenhuizen en de ggds konden de belasting nog aan de eerste dode in nederland viel op 4 augustusinmiddels had de minister op 19 juni 34 miljoen vaccins besteld ook andere europese landen zoals het verenigd koninkrijk frankrijk en duitsland bestelden vaccin voor de gehele bevolking maar landen waaronder belgi deden dat voor n enkele vaccinatie of bestelden niets vanwege gevreesde bijwerkingen of gebrek aan vertrouwen in de werking van het vaccin dan wel uit financile motievende zeggenschap over de gezondheidszorg berust in de europese unie bij de lidstaten het europese centre of disease control ecdc had in het verleden wel toegezien op de pandemische voorbereiding in de lidstaten maar speelde in de advisering over vaccinatie en behandeling met antivirale middelen geen enkele rol het gevolg was dat er in europa 27 verschillende protocollen voor de bestrijding van de pandemie bestondenhet unieke aan deze pandemie was dat nooit eerder een pandemisch virus zo snel gedetecteerd en getypeerd was ook de verspreiding van epidemiologische gegevens ging snel en het beleid kon op basis van deze evidence voortdurend worden bijgesteld via elektronische media kon de implementatie van dat beleid ook snel plaatsvinden de voorlichting aan de bevolking en ook aan de gezondheidszorgmedewerkers kon dit maar net bijhouden waardoor soms de indruk van een zwalkend beleid ontstondzo was het oorspronkelijke advies om iedere patint met griep tijdens de pandemie met een antiviraal middel te behandelen dit advies lag ten grondslag aan de opslag van vijf miljoen kuren oseltamivir en in kleinere aantallen zanamivir bij een geschatte ziektelast van een derde van de bevolking zou dan voldoende medicijn beschikbaar zijn de bedoeling was vooral om daarmee de top van de epidemie af te vlakken waardoor complicaties minder zouden voorkomen en over een grotere tijdspanne zouden worden gespreid daarmee zou de beschikbare ziekenhuiscapaciteit langer voldoende zijnaangezien bleek dat de pandemie tot milde ziekteverschijnselen leidde leek behandeling van iedere patint met griep met oseltamivir niet meer aan de orde de bijwerkingen van het middel zouden bij een dergelijk uitgebreide toepassing wellicht erger zijn dan de kwaal de sterfgevallen bleken vooral bij patinten uit de bekende risicogroepen te liggen bij kinderen onder de 2 jaar en bij zwangeren in het derde trimester bij die laatste groep leek de beperkte bewegingsmogelijkheid van het diafragma een belangrijke oorzaak want ook bij mensen met fors overgewicht werd meer sterfte gevonden het rivm bracht samen met de gezondheidsraad een advies uit om deze groepen met oseltamivir te behandelen mits mogelijk binnen 48 uur na de start van de ziekte6
inmiddels nam het aantal gevallen fors toe in nederland kwamen de besmettingen niet meer alleen uit mexico en de vs maar vooral uit andere europese vakantielanden als het verenigd koninkrijk en spanje de meldingsplicht en de isolatie van patinten leken niet meer doeltreffend op
15 augustus werd de meldingsplicht beperkt tot ziekenhuisopname en sterfte door het h1n1-virus behandeling van patinten met antivirale middelen werd beperkt tot de genoemde risicogroepen en profylactische toediening van oseltamivir aan familieleden werd gestaakt de reguliere gezondheidszorg en vooral de huisartsen moesten de pandemie gaan bestrijdenin september was het vaccin nog niet beschikbaar en gezondheidszorgpersoneel liep dus grote kans op besmetting voorzorgsmaatregelen als mondkapjes en handalcohol werden geadviseerd de adviezen van vr die tijd met bijvoorbeeld disposable schorten werden teruggedraaid wel bleef het advies om patinten thuis te bezoeken om zo besmetting op de praktijk te voorkomen vooral op huisartsenposten bleek dit advies moeilijk te implementeren en leidde het tot veel telefoontjes en gescheiden patintenstromende dreiging van het instorten van de gezondheidszorg door overbelasting met patinten of massale uitval van personeel bestond nog steeds de ghor de geneeskundige hulpverlening bij ongevallen en rampen maakte plannen om de gezondheidszorg zo veel mogelijk intact te houden regionale verschillen in uitvoering van de plannen maakten het voor de huisarts weinig overzichtelijk er kwamen plannen voor zorgmeldpunten die ingericht zouden worden bij uitval van huisartsenpraktijken deze zouden gevestigd worden in hotels en kazernes en zij zouden bemand moeten worden door dezelfde huisartsen die nu net uitgevallen waren plannen om huisartsenposten ook overdag open te stellen waren wellicht relerde vaccins waren besteld maar de levering zou nog even duren bovendien was de afspraak met de producent dat per maand een bepaald percentage van de bestelde hoeveelheid zou worden afgeleverd landen die weinig bestelden bijvoorbeeld alleen voor de risicogroepen kregen slechts een gedeelte tijdig geleverd aangezien nederland voor de totale bevolking had besteld kwamen voldoende vaccins voor de risicogroepen in november binnen op 17 augustus adviseerde de gezondheidsraad om de bekende risicogroepen te vaccineren aangevuld met werkers in de gezondheidszorg met directe patintencontacten en zwangeren7 gezinsleden van patinten met een hoog risico kwamen ook in aanmerking voor de vaccinatiede huisartsen hadden het seizoensvaccin al in huis en er was genoeg tijd om ook dat toe te dienen nog steeds was het onduidelijk of de gewone griep met influenza a h3n2 niet ook nog zou gaan circuleren gevolg was dat de risicogroepen drie vaccinaties moesten krijgen eenmaal voor de seizoensgriep en twee keer voor de mexicaanse griep de omvang van de risicogroep voor de mexicaanse griep was groter vanwege de toevoeging van de zwangeren de huisgenoten van hoogrisicopatinten en het personeel van de huisartsenpraktijk zelfnadat de vaccinatie van de bekende risicogroepen was afgesproken ontstond angst voor verdere verspreiding onder kinderen veel kinderen werden vaak uit voorzorg opgenomen maar sommige belandden op de kinder-ic tijdens de jaarwisseling wanneer vaak het rs-virus en het influenzavirus elkaar afwisselen is de bezetting van kinder-ics normaliter al hoog teneinde te voorkomen dat de kinderafdelingen zouden worden overspoeld met kinderen met influenza werd op 17 november besloten om alle kinderen ouder dan 6 maanden en jonger dan 5 jaar te vaccineren de gezinsgenoten van kinderen onder de 6 maanden  voor die jonge leeftijd is het vaccin niet geregistreerd  kregen ook het advies tot vaccinatie om zo besmetting van die kwetsbare babys te voorkomen twee weken later startten de ggds met het vaccineren van meer dan een miljoen kinderenal deze berichten leidden tot een grote informatiebehoefte bij het publiek en de gezondheidszorgmedewerkers het ministerie cordineerde de voorlichting aan het publiek met een huis-aan-huisfolder televisiespotjes en een speciale website het rivm verzorgde de voorlichting aan professionals dit gebeurde wat betreft de voorlichting aan huisartsen in nauw overleg met de lhv en het nhg beide beroepsorganisaties richtten een website over de mexicaanse griep in en zorgden ervoor dat alle informatie afgestemd bleef met die van vws en het rivm en voor de vaccinatie met het nationaal programma grieppreventie8 in tabel 5 staat als voorbeeld een opsomming van de activiteiten van het nhg zoals vermeld in het jaarverslag

alle voorlichting werd voortdurend onderzocht op consistentie vooral over het geadjuveerde vaccin kwam veel informatie op het web terecht op websites van bijvoorbeeld kritischprikkennl in een vragenlijstonderzoek bleek dat de informatie van het rivm en vws door 56 van de bevolking werd gewaardeerd9 de informatie van de ggd werd door 62 van de ondervraagden betrouwbaar geacht ruim 70 beoordeelde de informatie van de huisarts als het betrouwbaarstde vaccinatiegraad was ondanks al deze wisselende publiciteit niet anders dan tegen de seizoensgriep van de risicopopulatie kreeg 70 de seizoensprik 72 minstens n vaccinatie tegen de mexicaanse griep en 64 zelfs beide vaccinaties10 de vaccinatiegraad van de huisarts en het praktijkpersoneel zelf lag op gelijke hoogte11 de huisartsenpraktijken gaven in de periode oktober-november in totaal 12 miljoen vaccinaties de ggds haalden in de eerste ronde 69 van de opgeroepen kinderen en in de tweede ronde 58 de percentages liggen aanzienlijk hoger dan in andere landen zo werd in frankrijk nog geen 10 gevaccineerd daar werd de huisarts gepasseerd bij de vaccinatie en dat bleek geen goede zetde omvang van de mexicaanse griep bleek uiteindelijk na of juist door de vaccinatie mee te vallen zie figuur 1 het aantal gevallen zoals bijgehouden door de peilstations van het nivel kwam niet boven de normale seizoensgriep uit doordat bij ouderen de ziekte weinig voor kwam bleef de sterfte ver achter bij de normale jaarlijkse mortaliteit door influenza in totaal werden 2196 mensen opgenomen in een ziekenhuis en stierven 63 patinten aan de gevolgen van de mexicaanse griep

de discrepantie tussen de uitgebreide voorbereiding en de uiteindelijke omvang van de pandemie heeft wereldwijd geleid tot behoefte aan evaluatie de who de raad van europa het europees parlement en vele ministeries van gezondheidszorg startten onderzoek naar het effect van alle maatregelen in nederland zal het ministerie van vws voor eind 2010 daarover een rapport uitbrengen een belangrijk aspect is de rol die de farmaceutische industrie zou hebben gespeeld bij het opblazen van de pandemie de adviseurs van de who liggen onder vuur vanwege vermeende financile belangenhet lijkt te vroeg om nu al conclusies te trekken de effectiviteit van preventieve zorg is altijd moeilijk te meten het resultaat van preventie is een non-event als het goed wordt uitgevoerd gebeurt er niets de opvatting dat door de optimale voorbereiding en uitvoering van alle activiteiten de omvang van de pandemie is meegevallen is niet populair duidelijk is al wel dat europese afstemming node gemist is op het terrein van voorbereiding vaccinatie en antivirale behandeling waren er geen twee protocollen gelijk als alleen al dat zou verbeteren is de evaluatie niet voor niets geweest
in nederland sterft gemiddeld elk halfuur iemand omdat hij of zij heeft gerookt bijna 20000 doden per jaarnaar schatting hangen 4 van de 10 voortijdige sterfgevallen samen met rokenonder rokers is kanker de voornaamste doodsoorzaak met longkanker aan kop bijna 8600 sterfgevallen door longkanker toe te wijzen aan roken in 2017ook chronische ziekten door roken dragen fors bij aan de sterfte meer dan 5000 tabaksgerelateerde copd-sterfgevallen en meer dan 1000 door coronaire hartziekten in 2017
afgezien van vervroegde sterfte verhoogt roken het risico op tal van lichamelijke aandoeningen extra belangrijk in het kader van de covid-19 pandemie is de bij rokers beschreven verminderde immuunfunctie bij een aantal van deze aan roken gerelateerde aandoeningen zoals copd en hart- en vaatziekten heeft stoppen met roken zelfs meer effect dan een medicamenteuze behandeling van de aandoening zelf roken is tevens een belangrijke oorzaak van negatieve zwangerschapsuitkomsten verlaagde vruchtbaarheid perinatale sterfte spontane abortus loslating van de placenta buitenbaarmoederlijke zwangerschap en last but not least als niet-rokers meeroken verhoogt dit het risico met 25 procent op onder meer longkanker een cva en coronaire hartziekten bij volwassenen en luchtwegklachten bij kinderen daarnaast geldt dat de meeste rokers een tabaksverslaving hebben die voldoet aan de criteria van de dsm-5 daarmee is het een aandoening op zich die behandeling legitimeertin de nhg-behandelrichtlijn stoppen met roken 2017 staan richtlijnen voor diagnostiek en het beleid om rokers effectief te adviseren en te begeleiden bij het stoppen met roken in de nhg-behandelrichtlijn staat de medicamenteuze behandeling centraal de nhg-zorgmodule leefstijl roken gaat juist in op de niet-medicamenteuze begeleiding die bouwt voort op de eind vorige eeuw ontwikkelde minimale interventiestrategie stoppen met roken voor de huisartsenpraktijk h-mis tegenwoordig stimedic dan is er ook nog de zorgstandaard tabaksverslaving 2019 geautoriseerd door het nederlands huisartsen genootschap deze beschrijft de organisatie van de stoppen-met-rokenzorg waarin een integrale benadering wordt nagestreefd in de vorm van netwerkzorg met een programmatische aanpak door multidisciplinair samenwerkende zorgverleners een regiebehandelaar vaak de pohpvk zet zich in voor de cordinatie en continuteit van de zorg en fungeert als vast aanspreekpunt voor de patintde centrale speler tijdens de behandeling om te stoppen met roken is echter de roker de patint zelf zonder diens medewerking is de kans van slagen nul het bevorderen van het zelfmanagement van de patint is in elk onderdeel van de behandeling noodzakelijkbij rokers die niet gemotiveerd zijn om te stoppen beveelt de nhg-behandelrichtlijn aan om regelmatig jaarlijks het advies om te stoppen met roken te herhalen in ieder geval bij patinten met kinderwens en met aan roken gerelateerde klachten en aandoeningen bij patinten die overwegen om te stoppen kan een motivatieverhogende interventie hen over de streep helpen dat kan aan de hand van de 5 rs

research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed on march 3 2020 for reports on serological testing in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 we used the keywords covid-19 or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 and serology or serologic testing our search did not identify any reports of the epidemiological application of serological tests in covid-19 in one report researchers described serological characteristics of covid-19 and in other publications researchers have commented on the potential importance of covid-19 serological tests in another study epidemiological investigations were reported of the epidemic in singapore but serological methods had not been used
added value of this study
in our epidemiological investigation we used rt-pcr and serological testing to diagnose cases of covid-19 and establish links between clusters rt-pcr testing alone is limited by its ability to detect convalescent cases of covid-19 because rt-pcr can only detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the period of viral shedding which is the acute phase of infection serological testing can be useful in detecting previous infection in people with suspected infection who have recovered assisting in epidemiological investigation and containment efforts
implications of all the available evidence
covid-19 laboratory testing is focused on use of quantitative rt-pcr for diagnosis and serological testing can be overlooked we have highlighted the importance of serological testing for epidemiological investigation of covid-19 cases and we urge further development of serological testing capabilities
once individuals with covid-19 were identified their activities from 14 days before symptom onset until they were isolated were mapped and their close contacts traced contact tracing before symptom onset was done to identify the source of exposure that led to the case being infected allowing for further active case-finding around the source contact tracing after symptom onset until isolation was done to identify exposed individuals for quarantine to break the transmission chain both these approaches were part of the containment strategy a close contact was defined as anyone who had prolonged contact within 2 m of the case all close contacts with active or recent symptoms were tested whereas those who were asymptomatic and exposed while the case was symptomatic were quarantined activity maps were reviewed and cross-checked to establish potential exposures and identify possible epidemiological links between cases and clustersall epidemiological investigations and outbreak containment measures were implemented under the infectious diseases act5 which allows use of data for analysis to control outbreaksfor laboratory confirmation of covid-19 we did rt-pcr testing for sars-cov-2 using previously published methods6 two serological platforms were developed for confirmation of specific antibody responses to sars-cov-2 in people with suspected infection or individuals with pcr-confirmed disease a virus neutralisation test vnt was established at the duke-national university of singapore medical school absl3 facility using a sars-cov-2 virus isolate betacovsingapore22020 gisaid accession number epiisl407987 cultured from a patient in singapore vnt was done using protocols previously published for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov7 for elisa assays we used recombinant nucleocapsid protein from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 expressed in mammalian cell culture using the pcdna31 vector thermofisher scientific carlsbad ca usa according to previously published methods8 and a recombinant receptor binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein custom-produced by a commercial provider genscript piscataway nj usa elisa wells were coated with 100 ng of the respective protein per well and serum samples were used at dilutions from 150 to 1400 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human igg santa cruz dallas tx usa used at a dilution of 12000the funders had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationas of april 6 2020 singapore had recorded 1375 cases of covid-19 of which 554 were imported and 821 locally transmitted three clusters were identified that involved two churches church a and church b and one family gathering these clusters comprised 28 locally transmitted cases the clusters were linked to two travellers w1 and w2 from wuhan china who attended a church service at church a on jan 19 2020 figure 1
 the clusters at church a and church b were linked by one individual from church a a2 who probably transmitted the infection to the primary case of the church b cluster f1 at a family gathering on jan 25 2020 all cases were confirmed by rt-pcr testing except for a2 who was diagnosed by serological testingthe clusters at church a and church b were detected in early february and mid-february respectively although w1 and w2 were diagnosed with covid-19 at the end of january their possible link to church a was only discovered after the church a cluster was identified through investigation and repeat interviews5 by that time a2 had recovered from covid-19 and was not immediately linked to either cluster family members who had been infected at the family gathering on jan 25 2020 were first linked to f1 and were initially regarded as part of the cluster at church b however subsequent investigations into case histories indicated that the family cluster was a distinct cluster and that a2 was most probably the missing link between the two church clusters this idea was substantiated when a2s serological results were confirmed to be positivefive locally transmitted cases of covid-19 a1a5 were linked to church a these people attended a church service on jan 19 2020 the same day w1 and w2 visited the church although all five people had developed symptoms by feb 2 2020 figure 2
 only a1 a4 and a5 were diagnosed between feb 6 and feb 8 2020 because they had been hospitalised for pneumonia and tested for sars-cov-2 as part of enhanced surveillance measures to test all patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia a2 and a3 were not diagnosed when symptomatic in late january because their symptoms were mild and they did not meet the suspect case-definition at that time a2 and a3 were tested only after mapping of activities and movements of other cases suggested that a2 could be the missing link between the clusters at church a and church b an rt-pcr test of a nasopharyngeal specimen taken from a3 on feb 18 2020 was positive although this individual had clinically recovered from the illness which persisted from jan 28 to feb 10 2020 serological analysis of a serum sample obtained on the same day as the nasopharyngeal specimen was also positive although a2 had two negative rt-pcr tests the serological result was positive indicating past infectiona2 and a3 attended a chinese new year family gathering on jan 25 2020 at the home of f1 nine cases a2 a3 and f1f7 were linked to this family gathering a2 whose symptoms started on jan 23 2020 was unwell at this event and most probably was the primary source of transmission a3 developed symptoms later on jan 28 2020 and was therefore unlikely to be the source of infection at this gathering17 locally transmitted cases were linked to church b b1b16 and f1 thorough review of activity maps ascertained that f1 who had developed symptoms on jan 29 2020 and continued to work at church b while ill was the primary case of the church b clusterin mid-february epidemiological and clinical evidence strongly suggested that a2 was the missing link between the clusters at church a and church b through attendance at the family gathering on jan 25 2020 while symptomatic however by the time this link was ascertained more than 3 weeks had passed from symptom onset on jan 23 2020 and symptoms had resolved completely a week previously on feb 810 2020 a2 had two negative rt-pcr test results from samples taken from the nasopharynx with testing done 1 day apart on feb 18 and feb 19 2020 the sample for serological testing was taken on feb 18 2020 and a positive result was confirmed on feb 22 2020elisa results for a2 and a3 on feb 20 2020 figure 3a
 showed a strong antibody response to the sars-cov-2 rbd protein which was not seen in serum samples from sars-cov patients the results were further confirmed by vnt on feb 22 2020 figure 3bthis investigation shows how sars-cov-2 serological analysis elisa detecting igg and vnt detecting neutralising antibodies in addition to use of traditional epidemiological methods was important in establishing links among locally transmitted covid-19 cases and tracing the transmission chain to an imported source detection of covid-19 can be difficult because of the non-specific mild respiratory symptoms in many affected individuals and because some people might recover without being diagnosed9 although pcr tests offer a rapid diagnostic solution they can only detect sars-cov-2 during the period of viral shedding which is the acute phase of infection the duration of viral shedding for covid-19 is not certain10 but sars-cov data indicate that 21 days after symptom onset 53 of cases achieved viral clearance in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples11 as such pcr testing alone is limited by its ability to detect convalescent casesserological testing can be especially useful in detecting a previous suspected infection in people who have recovered for seroconversion kinetics past coronavirus studies indicate that all patients with middle east respiratory syndrome mers seroconverted 3 weeks after symptoms started12 and 93 of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars seroconverted at an average of 20 days from symptom onset11 the first preliminary analysis of sars-cov-2 igm and igg indicated that the antibody response in covid-19 patients is similar to if not earlier than these times13 cross-reactivity of immunoglobulins to closely related viruses such as sars-cov is a potential issue14 but our rbd-based elisa showed sufficient differentiation power a finding further supported by vnt resultsigm serological testing might hold promise as a diagnostic method although for sars and mers limitations for its use have been noted12 13 for mers igm was not detected earlier than igg and igm against prevalent human coronaviruses showed cross-reactivity12 preliminary data for sars-cov-2 igm are promising13 but more work is needed to assess the feasibility of igm serological analysis as a rapid diagnostic method to enhance covid-19 detection capabilitiesfor most people in the three clusters we report here transmission of infection was accounted for by close contact with a symptomatic case our findings suggest that covid-19 is largely transmitted by close contact particularly when contact occurs over a prolonged period and in close congregation two churches were the setting for covid-19 transmission in our report a church cluster has also been reported in south korea15 churches host prolonged repeated activities during which close contact occurs thus providing the opportunity for disease spread through droplets or fomites singing a common practice in churches can generate droplets in a similar quantity to coughing16 17 repeated social interactions of church groups has also facilitated discovery of transmission compared with other settings in which people might not know each other the interactions are similar in nature to large family gatherings which other cases in our report were linked to other similar settings include school and workplaces in which respiratory disease transmission is not uncommon and should be the focus for preparedness surveillance and containment measuresrisk of transmission could be reduced if symptomatic people do not attend events in which prolonged social interactions take place eg at the family gathering when a2 was unwell and f1 who continued to work at church b while unwell other risk reduction measures could include having smaller group activities and prevention of interactions across these groups moreover there may be common touchpoints within each setting that could result in contact transmission to prevent transmission people should practice increased personal hygiene and reduce physical contact to minimise indirect transmission riskslinking disease transmission to an imported source and contact tracing for each identified case has facilitated a high capture of cases in singapore this successful linking of a large proportion of cases to imported sources provides encouraging evidence that the intense containment measures undertaken in singapore have been effective the three clusters we report here occurred relatively early in the emergence of covid-19 in singapore within 4 weeks of the first imported case as the epidemic continues it might be progressively difficult to establish linkages by relying on traditional epidemiological methods alone challenges include difficulty in obtaining information from cases and contacts which could be inaccurate because of recall and other biases in our investigation information for symptom onset of w1 and w2 was based on case history alone and could not be independently corroborated5 in such instances determining the transmission chain would have to account for possible inconsistencies in case history and rely on triangulation with other methods the development and adoption of additional laboratory techniques such as serological tests and phylogenetic analysis by whole-genome sequencing could help identify possible links between casesserological testing is a key method in the response to the covid-19 epidemic as shown in our study it enabled detection of a convalescent case which could be key in initial containment efforts to discover transmission links to support containment efforts serological testing also detects people with mild or asymptomatic disease who have recovered allowing for more accurate determination of the number of people probably infected in a cluster or the population identifying people who were probably infected in household or school clusters could help ascertain attack rates by age particularly among children who mostly manifest less severe disease18 calculating population-level attack rates is also important to estimate disease incidence and the case-fatality rate cfr thus far the cfr for covid-19 has been based on pcr-diagnosed symptomatic cases serological surveys would be important to estimate cfr more accurately and would better inform calibrated responses to covid-19 as the pandemic progresses monitoring seroprevalence would enable countries to track transmission dynamics and population immunity levels and to inform disease control policies such monitoring would necessitate the development of ready serological testing solutions that are cost-effective and the establishment of population-level surveillance programmes to obtain blood samplesdevelopment and application of serological assays has helped to unravel connections between three clusters of covid-19 in singapore linking the disease to two travellers from china serological assays should be considered to identify mild or subclinical infections in the communityin december 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were identified in wuhan hubei province china huang et al 2020 the pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as it has a phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov zhu et al 2020 since then sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization who who 2020a as of march 4 2020 93091 laboratory-confirmed cases and 3198 deaths have been documented globally who 2020bcoronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the orthocoronavirinae subfamily although most human coronavirus infections are mild sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov  betacoronaviruses zoonotic in origin  have been associated with potentially fatal disease particularly during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively zaki et al 2012 zhong et al 2003 currently the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 a novel betacoronavirus is about 34 which is lower than the rate of 10 for sars-cov and 34 for mers-cov who 2020b who 2020c who 2020d however sars-cov-2 has potentially higher transmissibility than both sars-cov and mers-cov chen 2020the rapid and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 contributes to disease and outbreak management by enabling prompt and accurate public health surveillance prevention and control measures real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr has been the primary means for diagnosing sars-cov-2 huang et al 2020 however molecular detection carries the risk of false-negatives because of low viral loads in specimens pang et al 2020 serological testing another common laboratory diagnostic can diagnose illness by detecting antibodies serological studies on sars-cov-2 appear to be scarce the aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serological detection to covid-19 and the dynamic variance of viral antibodies in sars-cov-2 infectiona retrospective study was conducted at xixi hospital of hangzhou a designated hospital for emerging infectious disease in zhejiang province china from january 2020 to march 4 2020 case definitions of confirmed covid-19 are based on the who interim guidance who 2020eforty-three patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and at least one viral serological test performed in the hospital were enrolled in this study thirty-three patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in whom the disease was eventually excluded in the hospital and who quarantined at home were included as a control group the definition of suspected sars-cov-2 infection included a fever or any respiratory symptoms especially in those with a history of travel to wuhan or exposure to an infected case within 2 weeks before the onset of disease since january 2020 xu et al 2020 patients who were suspected to be infected were discharged from hospital once the results of two separate molecular tests performed with an interval of 24 h were negative the demographic and clinical data of these patients were extracted from their medical recordstwenty-four patients received laboratory confirmation at other hospitals and were transferred to xixi hospital of hangzhou oral swab or sputum specimens collected from the remaining 19 cases at admission were sent to the center for disease control of hangzhou and tested by real-time rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 rna laboratory confirmation of the virus was based on the result of real-time rt-pcr huang et al 2020 virus detection was repeated twice every 24 h fitness for discharge of covid-19 patients was based on a normal body temperature for at least 3 days with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from the upper respiratory tract on two occasionsthe study was approved by the ethics committee of xixi hospital of hangzhou and written informed consent was obtained from each participantserum was separated by centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min within 12 h of collection the sars-cov-2 igm and igg chemiluminescence immunoassay clia kits used in this study were supplied by shenzhen yhlo biotech co ltd china the magnetic beads of these clia assays are coated with two antigens of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein or n protein spike protein or s protein all serum antibody tests were performed with an iflash3000 fully automated clia analyzer from shenzhen yhlo biotech co ltd china sars-cov-2 igmigg titers in arbitrary units auml were calculated automatically by the immunoassay analyzer on the basis of relative light units rlu because the viral antibody titer is positively associated with rlu according to the manufacturers instructions the cut-off value for a positive sars-cov-2 igmigg result is 10 aumlcontinuous variables were expressed as the mean  standard deviation sd if normally distributed or as the median interquartile range iqr if not categorical variables were described as the count  serum antibody titers before and after conversion to virus-negative were compared using the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test proportions for categorical variables were compared using fishers exact test all analyses were done with ibm spss statistics software version 230 a two-sided p-value of less than 005 was considered statistically significantforty-three patients with a laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection were included in the study among them 24 patients were transferred to xixi hospital of hangzhou after laboratory confirmation elsewhere and the remaining 19 patients were confirmed in the hospital thirty-three patients with suspected covid-19 in whom the disease was finally excluded were chosen as the control groupthe demographic and clinical characteristics of the covid-19 and control groups are shown in table 1
the median age of the covid-19 patients was 470 years iqr 340590 years ranging from 7 years to 74 years and 395 were male among both groups less patients had chronic disease including hypertension diabetes and liver disease fever was present in 628 of covid-19 patients before or on admission the second most common symptom was cough 605 similarly fever and cough were also the most common symptoms in the control group the duration from first symptoms to hospital admission to laboratory confirmation and to first serological test in the covid-19 group patients was 3 days iqr 27 days 3 days iqr 27 days and 18 days iqr 1123 days respectively among these patients two with a history of exposure to an infected case presented without any symptom until the first serological testin the control group the igm and igg positive rates were 0 033 and 91 333 respectively the igg titers of the three positive patients were all less than 15 aumlin the covid-19 group 27 patients were tested for viral antibody before becoming virus-negative including oral swabs anal swabs or sputum the median duration from first symptoms to serological testing in these 27 patients was 16 days iqr 920 days among these people 13 were igm-positive 481 and 24 were igg-positive 889 three igg-negative patients were also igm-negative according to molecular detection as the gold standard the sensitivities of serum igm and igg antibodies to diagnose covid-19 were 481 1327 and 889 2427 respectively and the specificities were 100 3333 and 909 3033 respectively moreover the positive predictive values ppvs of igm and igg antibodies were 100 1313 and 889 2427 respectively and the negative predictive values npvs were 702 3347 and 909 3033 respectivelyafter the 43 cases in the covid-19 group were laboratory-confirmed 98 serological tests were performed figure 1a shows that the igm-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased as the number of days from laboratory confirmation to serological detection increased in contrast the igg-positive rate increased to 100 and was higher than igm at all times meanwhile the virus-positive rate tended to decrease over time before laboratory confirmation two serological tests were performed in one case and viral igm and igg were both positive in two results figure 1b shows a similar trend as the duration from symptom onset to serological testing increased it was also found that both igm and igg levels were not high during the first 5 days following symptom onset in the covid-19 group 34 patients were tested for viral antibody after two oral swabs taken 24 h apart tested negative without other molecular detection positive the igm and igg positive rates were 559 1934 and 941 3234 respectively two igg-negative patients were also igm-negative the median igm and igg titers among these 34 people were 121 auml iqr 52466 auml and 1322 auml iqr 6551791 auml respectively all patients were discharged and the median time from this serological test to discharge was 2 days iqr 13 daysamong these 34 people who were tested after they were virus-negative 20 also had serological testing performed before they became virus-negative table 2
shows that the igm-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative the igg-positive rate was up to 90 and also not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative however the median igg titer after testing virus-negative was double that before and the difference was statistically significant the median interval between these two serological tests was 6 days iqr 49 daysas the diagnosis of covid-19 is complicated by the diversity of symptoms and imaging findings molecular and serological detection tools are rapidly being developed laboratory confirmation of covid-19 has been based on a positive real-time rt-pcr result however molecular and serological studies on this virus appear to be scarce in this study 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and 33 suspected patients in whom the disease was finally excluded by nucleic acid test twice and who were rapidly discharged were included to investigate the diagnostic value of serological detection to covid-19 in addition the dynamic variance of viral antibodies during sars-cov-2 infection was also examinedmost of the infected patients in this study were female the age range of individuals was wide with children and those older than 65 years also being infected the proportion of patients with any co-existing illness among the infected individuals was low in this study consistent with the non-severe patients in the study by guan et al guan et al 2020 through the media and national advocacy people who had been in contact with an infected case as well as those with a suspected infection were asked to go to the hospital at an early stageas soon as possible furthermore xixi hospital of hangzhou was a designated tertiary hospital and mainly admitted patients with mild to moderate symptoms in hangzhou fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in concert with recent studies huang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 guan et al 2020 in the control group the patients were generally younger more often male and less commonly presented any co-existing illness when compared to those in the infected groupin this study it was found that the specificities of serum igm and igg to diagnose covid-19 were both more than 90 when compared to molecular detection moreover the igg titers of the three positive patients in the control group were only weakly positive in the covid-19 group igm and igg were also both found to be positive in one case before laboratory confirmation for the first time therefore covid-19 should be considered when serum igm or igg is positive in the covid-19 patients the igg-positive rate 889 was found to be higher than the igm-positive rate 481 before conversion to virus-negative by molecular detection interestingly three igg-negative patients were also igm-negative in this study the duration from symptom onset to this serological test in these three patients was 0 days 5 days and 8 days respectively furthermore it was observed that serum viral antibodies increased only slightly in the early stage of the disease hence it may be that serum viral antibodies have not been produced yet and could be undetectable zhang et al found that the igm and igg positive rates were 50 and 81 on day 0 the day of first sampling and increased to 81 and 100 respectively on day 5 zhang et al 2020 thus covid-19 cannot be excluded at an early stage when viral serological testing is negativethe igm-positive rate showed a trend to increase at first and then decline however the igg-positive rate increased and then became stable over time furthermore the igg-positive rate was consistently higher than the igm-positive rate and this phenomenon was also observed in the study by zhang et al 2020 there were two patients with both igm and igg negative after oral swabs were negative twice the interval between laboratory confirmation and serological testing was 10 days for one of these patients and 14 days for the other a lag period was found as antibodies specifically targeting mers-cov would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset al johani and hajeer 2016 therefore we cannot infer whether viral antibodies have not been produced yet or have turned negative because of the use of only one serological test as well as the high positive rate we found that the igg titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before in this study these covid-19 patients were discharged soon after oral swabs were negative on two occasions whether higher antibodies titers in sars-cov-2 infection are associated with better outcomes needs to be studied furtherthis study has several limitations first only 43 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients and 33 controls were included therefore due to the small sample size the study results should be interpreted with caution second the time to viral molecular detection and to serological testing was variable and depended on clinician judgement as this was a retrospective study third since the infected patients included in this study were non-severe cases the value of serological testing in patients with severe cases of the disease needs to be assessed fourth the median duration from symptom onset to serological testing was long as viral serological detection kits were available late finally follow-up data on these individuals who were discharged are scarcein conclusion viral serological testing is an effective means of diagnosis for sars-cov-2 infection the positive rate and titer variance of igg are higher than those of igm in the course of covid-19this study was supported by the research project on the prevention and treatment of covid-19 in hangzhou establishment of a clinical diagnosis and treatment system for covid-19 with treatment evaluationthe study was approved by the ethics committee of xixi hospital of hangzhou and written informed consent was obtained from each participantthe authors declare no conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have influenced the work reported in this papercoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 formerly known as 2019-ncov appeared in china for the first time and subsequently spread worldwide 12 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who officially announced the covid-19 epidemics as a threat to public health internationally and subsequently in march 2020 the global situation escalated into the covid-19 pandemic johns hopkins university reported over 7600000 cases of infection and more than 427000 deaths as of 13 june 2020 3 as a result of this rapidly progressing covid-19 pandemic and the limited laboratory-based molecular testing capacities new point-of-care poc scalable rapid diagnostic tests have been invented recently as easy-to-use tools to allow covid-19 diagnostics outside of laboratory settings what is more the urgent need to multiply testing for covid-19 has been clearly identified as an essential element of the anti-coronavirus strategy all over the worldthe diagnostic sensitivity specificity and accuracy concerning suspected covid-19 infection based on controlled testing and performance data from clinical settings is of substantial importance in the context of limiting the scope of coronavirus epidemics unreliable and unproved tests may not detect patients with active infection or may incorrectly indicate covid-19-negative patients as positive hampering healthcare efforts the diagnostic laboratory and point-of-care tests pocts used in order to detect sars-cov-2 are first of all reference tests based on molecular technique real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay rt-qpcr as well as serological antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting tests for auxiliary purposes at present only molecular quantitative reverse transcription pcr rt-qpcr testing of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the identification and laboratory confirmation of covid-19 cases as these methods were evaluated for their quality and safety through the world health organization who protocols 45 on the other hand based on current scientific evidence who recommends the use of poc immunodiagnostic tests for research purposes and at present they should not be utilized in a clinical decision-making setting and in patient care until fully validated with supporting data available however they can be useful in epidemiologic research or disease surveillance and further evolve as a critical step to develop covid-19 vaccine in future at the time of increased demand for hospital services clinicians governments and health services urgently need a fast sensitive but at the same time inexpensive diagnostic test in order to rapidly manage patients regarding admissions to hospitals meant for covid-19 treatment therefore the role of an approved and reliable diagnostic test in the covid-19 care pathway is of the utmost importanceas in the case of other infectious diseases the rt-qpcr method as well as serological tests are suitable for the in vitro diagnostics ivd of patients suspected of being infected with sars-cov-2 genetic assay based on the rt-qpcr technique performed in real time especially plays a role at the early stages of viral infection when the virus multiplies quickly as this technique enables direct detection of the pathogens genetic material a different approach in diagnosing infection is represented by serological methods based on detectingin blood serumof antibodies that act specifically against viral proteins which are produced in response to sars-cov-2 serological ivd tests detect antibodies which are responsible for neutralizing the virus therefore this implies that they are used when the immunological reaction against sars-cov-2 virus is already taking place these ivd measures can determine how fast antibodies fighting the virus are produced which may influence the identification of subjects who already developed immunity the results of serological ivd tests should not be used as basis for diagnosing ruling out infection with sars-cov-2 or informing about infection status 6the relatively quick discovery of the composition of the full genome of sars-cov-2 early during the epidemics made it easier to develop specific starters and normalized laboratory protocols for covid-19 the protocol of the first rt-qpcr test focused on rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp envelope e and nucleocapsid n of sars-cov-2 was published very early indeed at the end of january 2020 providing a brief description the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is equipped with a receptor-binding domain rbd a structure similar to the original sars-cov that emerged for the first time in 2002 functionally important orfs 1a and 1b and other main structural proteins including the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins are also well interrelated and clearly annotated according to previous reports the m and e proteins are essential for virus assembly while the s protein is crucial for affinity and attachment to host cells as the rbd of the s protein enables binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the s protein on the surface of the viral particles and has been reported to be highly immunogenic the n protein the main structural protein of sars-cov-2 is responsible for the transcription and replication of viral rna the packaging of the encapsulated genome into virions and interactions with the cell cycle of host cells in addition coronaviruses contain the n protein which has a substantial immunogenic ability and is abundantly expressed during viral infection figure 1 the sn proteins are targeted as potential antigens for serodiagnosis of covid-19 similarly to other diagnostic methods that were implemented for diagnosing sars disease based on sn proteins 7the progress made in recent years in the diagnostics of infections enables the application often simultaneously of numerous methods in order to detect respiratory viruses effectively the choice of suitable tests depends upon the type of virus to be detected the presumed number of antigens patient population to be tested as well as the technical abilities and experience of the testing unit the validation of rt-qpcr tests seems to be an important step in combating the new coronavirus one of the most significant parameters regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic procedure is most probably the one related to the minimum amount of analyte which may be detected and quantitatively determine by means of a particular test the parameters describing those properties are known as limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq in many laboratories lod is used interchangeably with sensitivity analytical sensitivity orand detection limit this may be misleading though as sensitivity is also understood and used in other ways sensitivity and clinical diagnostic specificity are two different parameters diagnostic sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results to the sum of true positive and true negative results a sensitivity ratio of 100 implies that all the sick people have been identified the specificity of a test is the proportion of true negative results to the sum of true negative and false positive ones the specificity of 100 implies that all healthy people in a given test have been correctly identified as healthynot having the condition as indicated in table 2 sensitivity and specificity of tests is already about 100 with a few exceptions still one can notice differences in analytical sensitivity of the test lod the vast majority of molecular tests kits contain a so-called internal positive control ipc that can be utilized either as an extraction control or internal control the ipc is essential for an evaluation of whether the genetical material extraction procedure and amplification stage were carried out correctly the failure in ipc detection using a patients specimen may indicate the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical material as a consequence of nucleic acid loss or the transposition of pcr inhibitors and the lack of sufficient biological material in the collected sample it needs to be noted that many molecular tests may not provide sets for extraction stages and they need to be acquired separately however all tests reviewed here that detect the rna of sars-cov-2 contain ipcanother important factor which describes a diagnostic test is the analytical specificity it is the ability of a test to detect a specific target eg a virus it is of great importance to check whether the starters used in pcr test are specific to a given virus there are two components of analytical sensitivity cross-reactivity and interference cross-reactivity may occur if in a sample collected from a patient there are organisms which are genetically related that imitate the virus analysed which causes test starters to cross react as shown in table 3 the producers have analysed their tests from the perspective of cross-reactivity unfortunately that analysis is selective and does not concern the same micro-organismsamong the many contemporary technologies available special attention should be paid to rapid lateral flow immunoassay lfia also referred to as immunochromatographic tests perhaps they are not so much appreciated in the scientific community as pcr methods or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa tests despite the fact that they do find application in diagnostics more and more often they differ depending on the type of test but the basic principle of their action is invariably the samethey make use of the unique property that antibodies possess that of selective binding to a specific particle or group of similar particles antigen lfias provide an uncomplicated and relatively inexpensive tool meant for detecting the presence or absence of a given component in the examined specimen such as the presence of a virus in an analyzed blood sample examination with the use of those tests is possible for various types of test materialwhole human blood blood plasma serum stool urine sweat cerebrospinal fluid or even tears 9 the test principle is based on an immunological method using specific antibodies most often in complex with colloidal gold where a drop of the examined substance first moves along the nitrocellulose membrane using capillary phenomena after the sample is absorbed by the membrane the antigen should the test prove to be positive binds to the colloidal gold complex and respective antibodies consequently the effect of that reaction is the formation of a complex which will be detected by the test the interpretation of results consists of confirmation or ruling out of the presence of antigens in the examined sample based on color test strips that appear in the test 2122 the brief comparison of advantages and disadvantages of immunochromatographic tests is presented in table 4at present most immunoenzymatic tests available are based on the immunochromatic technique the difference between those tests depends upon the molecule assayed pc or antigens structure performance time and diagnostic material it may be supposed that in future rapid tests will enable easier and quicker diagnostics of many diseases without the necessity of performing tedious and complicated procedures this would reduce the waiting time for obtaining results and accelerate decision making regarding suitable treatment 272829the detection of specific sars-cov-2 serum antibodies allows for a rapid cost-effective and reasonably sensitive clinical diagnosis of covid-19 as immunoglobulins such as igm provide the initial humoral response during the first stage of viral infection prior to the onset of the adaptive high-affinity igg response essential for long-term immunological memory research indicates that after sars infection antibodies of the igm class may be detected in patients blood about 6 days after the infection while igg may be already detected after 8 days as sars-cov-2 belongs to the same large family of viruses which includes those causing middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it should be assumed that the process of producing antibodies will be similar to that in case of other viruses belonging to that family while the detection of igg antibodies and igm antibodies acting against sars-cov-2 may be an indication of infection moreover the detection of igm antibodies usually indicates a recent exposure to sars-cov-2 whereas the detection of igg antibodies in case of covid-19 indicates exposure to the virus some time ago 30serological tests detecting solely the igm class of antibodies should find applications for diagnostic purposes when using tests which detect both igm and igg antibodies one should remember that a positive result may be the evidence of past infection not active infection table 5 negative results from serological tests do not exclude sars-cov-2 infection as the window period delay in the production of antibodies may exceed 7 days serological tests may also give false positive results this may be the case of past or ongoing infection with virus strains other than sars-cov-2 such as coronavirus hku1 nl63 oc43 or 229e moreover the first tests assessing the titer of iga class antibodies have been launched which from the perspective of immunology is of extreme importance as it provides the possibility of testing for antibodies in a material other than blood samples collected from patients eg respiratory tract secretionsserological tests are thus applied as an adjunctive method for monitoring the epidemiological situation yet they may be performed faster and are less costly than genetic tests this diagnostic method has a limited sensitivity yet efforts to improve it are ongoing as it is useful for monitoring the infection due to insufficient data concerning among others the dynamics of immunological response to infection and the diagnostic value of available tests for detecting igm and igg class antibodies comprising sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive value in many countries it is currently not recommended to use serological tests for diagnostic purposes table 6 displays the evaluation of serological tests validated by the fda and table 7 provides a comparison of the selected immunochromatographic tests for sars-cov-2 based on sensitivity specificity sample type and test performance timein serological ivd the so-called window period is of much importancethat is the time when specific antibodies are not yet detectable in a patients blood in the initial phase of an infection the production of antibodies is initiated but their level is still low and thus test results may prove negative anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies appear quite late ie a few days after clinical manifestations which is why serological tests cannot be used as a basic tool in diagnosing sars-cov-2 infections 32the detection of specific anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies is possible about 10 days after the first clinical manifestations of infection thus this serves the purpose of confirming contact with coronavirus and is of enormous importance from an epidemiological perspective as it allows us to detect subjects who had the infection but were asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic and could have been the source of infection for other people silent carriersvectors it also allows us to determine the spread of covid-19 infection in the population a comparative review of currently available serological immunodiagnostic covid-19 tests is presented in table 8the protein microarray method pmm is a proteomic screening technique serving the purpose of simultaneousparallel quantitative and qualitative analysis of mixtures containing many proteins the chip used is composed of a supporting surface eg modified glass plate nitrocellulose membrane or microtitration plate on which the matrix of capturing proteins is immobilized in accordance with the determined formula performing the function of a probe the material captured may be antibodies enzymes or ligands protein analyte added to the matrix may be modified by means of various types of markers among others radioisotopes fluorescence luminescence markers the interaction between micromatrix proteins and analyte induces an analytical signal registered by means of suitable equipment the advantages of protein micromatrices include the short time required for analysis modest consumption of samples and reagents high sensitivity automation of testing they allow us to investigate the functions and effects of proteins on large scale 3334the newly developed pepperchip sars-cov-2 proteome microarray pepperprint based on the sars-cov-2 genome derived from the virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 enables us to serologically screen about 5000 individual peptides spanning the whole viral proteome sequences of orf1ab protein surface glycoprotein orf3a protein coat protein membrane glycoprotein orf6 protein orf7a protein orf8 protein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and orf10 protein have been elongated and connected by means of neutral gsgsgsg connectors the elongated protein sequences have been transcribed into 4883 different peptides composed of 15 amino acids printed in two repetitions 9766 peptide sites in order to obtain high-resolution epitope data in the case of sars-cov which emerged in 2002 it was demonstrated that the application of pmm is characterized by enhanced sensitivity as more chinese subjects were diagnosed as sars-positive when applying pmm in comparison with elisa tests the pmm seems to be more reliable as it allows us to determine more protein antigens of the virus 35 an additional advantage of such tests is the possibility of automating the entire analytical process unfortunately the method has several imperfections including the repeatability of the test itself while the cost of the testing and equipment used for micromatrix diagnostics is significant which makes the pmm method less accessible in standard laboratory settings 36undoubtedly the scalable and reliable pocts used in the community and outside laboratories would have the opportunity to reduce the time to obtain covid-19 diagnostic results and might support early implementation of isolation resources and infection control measures from a medical workforce point of view antibody- and antigen-detecting tests appear to have a significant role in identifying healthcare workers who recovered from sars-cov-2 infection to assess their suitability to provide frontline health services on the other hand the false negative serology tests could cause spread of covid-19 unjustified reassurance and a change in public behavior undoubtedly the negative results of serology tests swabs should not be treated as definitive for ruling out but a positive test results are beneficial to rule in coronavirus infection the sufficient accuracy of serology tests used more widely will allow us to make an appropriate decision regarding lifting restrictions on a national level nevertheless the wider implementation of pocd will ultimately support public health strategies about the potential lifting of social distancing restrictions in future 30 moreover with the limited data available at present for antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting rapid pocd further intense research into their potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged if these tests demonstrate adequate accuracy it is likely that they could potentially be used as triage tests for quick identification of patients who are suspected of contracting covid-19 reducing the need for expensive reference molecular pcr testing 46 finally it is worth noting the psychological and behavioral consequences of correctly established and known immunity status within the communityrecently a test has been developed based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprcas12a with visual readouts the test can detect 10 copies of the virus gene in merely 45 min providing simple and reliable diagnostic method which additionally demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in order to enable fast diagnosis at the hospital or on admission the test has been provided with an ssdna reporter labeled with a blank green fluorescent particle which will be split off by the cas12a protein when the nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 is found in the detection system in this way a green signal of fluorescence will be obtained visible with the naked eye in the light with a wavelength of 485 nm the high specificity of the test was obtained by designing 15 crrnas which may distinguish the polymorphisms of a single nucleotide with other viruses related to sars in four domains orf1a or orf1b n and e genes 37the search for new diagnostic methods is continued because sars-cov-2 is spread by droplets while the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity index for rt-qpcr tests is the highest for broncho-alveolar lavage bal higher than for sputum or nosethroat swabs scientists recently proposed the use of exhaled breath condensate ebc for diagnostic purposes ebc is most similar in its biochemical composition and origin to bal examinations with the use of ebc are a relatively novel diagnostic method used mainly to assess inflammation within the respiratory tract and its components reflect the composition of the fluid lining the bronchi and alveoli ebc is a condensed form of small droplets of the fluid lining the lungs which is usually exhaled it contains various components from small ions to proteins and organelles it may even contain viruses fungi and bacteria taking samples of the condensate is safe totally non-invasive easy to perform it may be repeated many times it may also be performed on patients with severe complications of covid-19 its enormous advantage is that in may be performed in small children with the use of special facial masks the course of the examination is such that the patient is requested to exhale when breathing uneventfully for some 10-15 min to an apparatus provided with a cooling system which allows us to accumulate the condensate in which sars-cov-2 may be detected the application of this method seems justified from a public health perspective the false positive results that are presently obtained contribute the continued spread of the virus worldwide 3839the optimization of laboratory diagnostics is the most dynamically developing field in the time of the covid-19 pandemic supporting contemporary medicine government decisions and healthcare strategies the efforts of scientistclinician teams focus first of all upon implementing the most reliable diagnostic tools however because covid-19 is a new nosological entity there are not enough data as of yet that would enable the determination of standards for the interpretation of serological pocts as with any other infectious diseases the diagnostic value of a test is not only about the method of collecting the material the quality of the sample and the equipment applied equally essential pre-analytical considerations are also the time point when a sample is collected as well as a suitable procedure storage and handling prior to analysis from the moment of collecting the biological material to the assaying stagecoronaviruses infect a wide range of mammals and birds exhibit a marked tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory and enteric tracts and cause a remarkably diverse spectrum of diseases in humans and livestock they typically have a restricted host range

2013 sequence similarity comparisons of dipeptidyl peptidase4 dpp4 cd26 the functional receptor for merscov have revealed that equine dpp4 is phylogentically closely related to human dpp4 and the binding affinity of merscov spike s1 domain for equine dpp4 is similar to that of human and camel dpp4 raising the possibility that merscov infections may occur among horses barlan et al 2014 serological studies of horses originating from spain and the united arab emirates gave negative results for merscov alexandersen et al 2014 meyer et al 2015 but it is still relevant to investigate for evidence of merscov in horses in areas endemic for merscovwe have tested for coronavirus infections in apparently healthy horses in saudi arabia and oman by testing nasal and rectal swabs by rtpcr

assayscrossreactive responses in the merscov ppnt bcov mn and ecov mn assays were assessed using a panel of previously characterized immune or hyperimmune reference antisera generated against alpha beta and gamma coronaviruses these sera were either obtained from bei resources animal cov reagents supplied to bei by dr linda saif httpwwwbeiresourcesorgaboutbeiresourcesaspx or kindly provided by dr linda saif or dr stanley perlman equine sera known to be seropositive to ecov were provided by dr nicola pusterla department of veterinary medicine and epidemiology school of veterinary medicine university of california davis ca usa the homologous antibody titres to the immunized virus were also obtained where available from the providers of these respective antisera the serum panel for alpha coronavirus included sera generated against porcine respiratory coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus canine enteric coronavirus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus sera produced against mouse hepatitis virus strains jhm and a59 sars coronavirus bcov ecov represented the betacoronavirus group furthermore an immune serum for infectious bronchitis virus was used as representative for the gammacoronavirus group all these reference sera as well as additional ecov immune sera and merscovnegative camel sera were tested in ppnt or mn assays in parallel against merscov bcov as well as ecov to assess possible crossreactive antibody responses among these three coronaviruses some of these reference sera with the exception of horse and camel sera had been previously tested against merscov and bcov and the results were reported by us hemida et al 2014all nasal and rectal swabs were tested using the pancoronavirus nested rtpcr assay ecov and merscov upe gene rtqpcr assays all swabs were negative in the merscov rtqpcr assay five rectal swabs 5315 were positive for coronavirus rna by the pancoronavirus assay tables 1 and 2 sequencing of the 440 base pair nucleotide fragment from the rdrp gene confirmed four of these to be ecov and the other to be dromedary camel hku23like virus designated as equine hku23 cov sa1354 additional sequence was obtained from these specimens to generate a nucleotide sequence of 933 nucleotides position 14780 to 15712 of ecov strain nc99 which was used for analysis of nucleotide differences in comparison with other coronaviruses genbank accession numbers ky458228ky458232 table 3 and phylogenetic analysis which confirmed the identification of the coronaviruses to be ecov and hku23 respectively figure 1 this result led to the testing of 306 nasal and 315 rectal swab specimens by specific rtqpcr assays for ecov and rtqpcr assay for hku23 testing by the ecov specific rtqpcr led to the detection of five rectal swabs specimens four of which had been detected by the pancoronavirus rtpcr assay as well as an additional positive rectal swab ct value 363 from a horse in the riyadh area table 2 using the hku23specific rtqpcr two positives were detected including sa1354 identified as hku23 by sequencing the pancoronavirus rtpcr assay amplicon and an additional positive result with a high ct value of 376 from a nasal swab sample none of the other nasal swabs had evidence of coronavirus rna compared to the pancoronavirus assay the specific ecov and hku23specific assays detected one additional specimen that was weakly positive for each of these viruses table 2the five pancoronavirus pcr covpositive specimens had ct ranging from 294 to 359 in either the ecov or hku23 specific assays the pancoronavirus rtpcr was not sensitive at detecting specimens with ct higher than 36 in the ecov or hku23 assays however the results do demonstrate the importance of using the pancoronavirus assay when investigating coronavirus activity in animal species in new geographic areas our initial focus was to explore for evidence of merscov infections in horses in saudi arabia and oman none of the rectal swabs were positive for merscov rna but the application of the pancoronavirus rtpcr to these specimens revealed the presence of two other coronaviruses infecting horses in this region that is ecov and hku23all seven horses from whom ecov or hku23 were detected were apparently healthy the specimens positive for ecov rna all came from different horses at a horse breeding facility in riyadh the two horses positive for hku23 rna were from dammam and qateef saudi arabia where horses were used for farming and in dammam also for breeding tables 1 and 2 in both cases these horses frequently came into contact with camels and other domestic livestock hku23 coronavirus is known to be endemic in camels woo et al 2014we investigated for serologic evidence of merscov infections in the 243 horse sera using ppnt screening followed by endpoint titrations any sera positive at a screening reciprocal antibody titre of 20 in ppnt were confirmed using mn assay and prnt assay using live merscov strain emc possible serologic crossreactions with ecov and bcov were evaluated in mn assays which are the most specific serological assays available of the 243 sera tested only five 2 had detectable merscov antibody in the mersppnt assay at a screening titre of 20 four of these were from saudi arabia and one was from oman the endpoint mersppnt titres of these five sera ranged from 40 to 160 but only serum 92 which had the highest mersppnt titre was positive in the merscov mn test titre 20 table 4 in the confirmatory prnt which is considered the gold standard serological test for merscov horse serum 92 reduced plaque numbers by 90 prnt90 up to a titre of 40 this serum was negative in ecov and bcov mn assays table 4 this serum was from a racing horse stable in alqassem and may represent a rare example of transmission of merscov to horses or crossreaction with another yet undocumented coronavirus infecting horses this horse was not known to frequently come into contact with camels three of the other sera serum id nos 535 541 212 positive in the merscov ppnt assay had detectable ecov mn antibody and one of these also had detectable bcov mn antibody table 4 thus these may well represent evidence of crossreactive responsesthe extent of the serological crossreactivity of merscov ecov and bcov was systematically investigated we did not have an isolate of hku23 virus available for serological testing and bcov was used as a virus that is genetically closely related to hku23 with pairwise amino acid similarity of 941 in the spike protein gene the determinant of antigenic crossreaction in neutralization tests woo et al 2014 horse sera obtained from the usa reported to be strongly reactive by elisa optical density ranging from 1458 to 1939 for ecov showed high titre 1280 for ecov in mn assay as expected but also had high antibody titres ranging from 160 to 1280 in bcov mn tests table 5 as these horse sera were from horses in the field they may well have been exposed to multiple coronaviruses thus these results may reflect crossreactivity or coinfection of us horses with ecov and bcovlike viruses two of these sera showed low titres 20 in the merscov ppnt assay but were negative in the more stringent merscov mn assay as merscov is not circulating in the usa these results suggest crossreactivity between merscov and ecov or related covs may occur albeit at low titre similarly a bcov immune serum from an experimentally infected gnotobiotic calf showed detectable but 16fold reduced antibody titre with ecov but no crossreaction with merscov spike proteins of equine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus have an overall amino acid similarity of 808 and 731 similarity of the s1 region which contains the receptorbinding domain and neutralization epitopes this probably explains the large difference in neutralization titres observed in table 5 a dromedary serum from kazakhstan a region known to be free of merscov activity miguel et al 2016 had detectable antibody to bcov probably reflecting hku23 or bcov infection and also to ecov we cannot conclude whether this reflects crossreactivity or infection with bcov hku23 andor ecov none of the beta coronavirus immune sera to sarscov or mouse hepatitis virus nor immune sera to alpha or gamma coronaviruses gave crossreactions in bcov or ecov mn assays table 5 as had been previously reported none of these dromedary sera crossreacted with merscov hemida et al 2014fiftyfour horse sera from saudi arabia and oman were selected to represent different collection locations excluding those five sera previously reported to be merscov ppnt positive table 6 these sera were seronegative for merscov as expected 40 74 of them had detectable mn antibody to ecov titres ranging from 20 to 640 median 40 and 18 333 had mn antibodies to bcov titres ranging from 20 to 160 median 20 the reciprocal geometric mean antibody titres assigning sera with titres 20 the value of 10 for computational purposes for ecov and bcov were 44 and 255 respectively there were twentyfour sera with undetectable antibody to bcov with detectable ecov antibody titres ranging from 20 to 640 the titres to ecov were higher than or equal to titres to bcov with two exceptions where the titre to bcov 20 was marginally higher than that with ecov table 6 these results are compatible with the rtpcr detection of ecov in rectal swabs in horses and probably suggest that ecov or a closely related virus is commonly infecting horses in many regions of the arabian peninsula two of the five horses in whom ecov rna was detected by rtqpcr had low ecov mn antibody titres 20 while the other three had titres ranging from 160 to 640 table 6 this may reflect virus shedding persists into convalescence or that reinfection of previously seropositive horses can occurthe rtqpcr detection of two hku23like viruses indicates that hku23 which is common in dromedaries in the region is also infecting horses in the absence of an hku23 isolate for use in neutralization tests and given the potential serological crossreactivity between these three viruses it is difficult to conclude how commonly equines are infected with hku23 the antibody titres to bcov which is genetically closely related to hku23 in the spike protein gene may suggest that bcov or hku23like virus infection of horses does occur in saudi arabiathe serological evidence of one of the 243 sera with detectable merscov antibody titres in the prnt90 test raises the question whether merscov may occasionally cross species to horses this serum did not have any detectable antibody to ecov or bcov however it is not possible to exclude the possibility that this observation reflects crossreaction with ecov bcov or other yet unknown coronaviruses confirmation of natural infection of horses with merscov can only come from detection of merscov rna in horse specimens recent experimental infection of horses with merscov did not result in virus replication or seroconversion adney et al 2016in conclusion the serological data suggest that lineage a betacoronaviruses are commonly infecting horses in saudi arabia and oman but antibody crossreactions between these viruses do not permit us to use serological data alone to identify which coronaviruses are causing these infections rtpcr detection of ecov and hku23 in equine swabs confirms the circulation of these two viruses in horses in saudi arabia cocirculation of related viruses may provide potential for recombination a potential means of generating genetic diversity and facilitating host jumps in coronaviruses this is the first report of hku23 being detected in horses and the first detection of ecov in asia outside of japanwe declare that we have no conflict of interestson march 18 2003 who initiated a virtual network of laboratories to investigate the cause of sars16 daily teleconferences updated members of the network on the progress of laboratory investigations in different parts of the world on patients with suspected sars16 this investigation established that influenza and other common respiratory pathogens were not the cause of this novel disease syndrome strategies for the detection of a novel agent included the use of direct electron microscopy on respiratory specimens bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue obtained from lung biopsy or necropsy culture in cell lines known to support respiratory viral infection and subsequently on other types of cells pcr and reverse-transcription pcr rt-pcr with consensus primers for respiratory viral pathogens and random-primer rt-pcr methods serology was used for the detection of agents antigenically related to known respiratory pathogens one of the problems faced in this investigation was the differentiation of sars from more routine causes of atypical pneumonia the one feature supporting the probable diagnosis of sars was epidemiological linkage to a cluster of similar disease cases substantial numbers of such cases were initially present in guangzhou at the hospital outbreaks at hanoi and at the prince of wales hospital hong kong and subsequently in toronto and singapore through global case notification a suspected case from singapore was also intercepted on a flight arriving in frankfurt germany17
members of the network reported virus-like particles in clinical respiratory specimens by electron microscopy and these virus particles had pleomorphic morphology compatible with paramyxoviruses16 17 shortly after human metapneumovirus was detected in the respiratory tract of patients with sars at the prince of wales hospital in hong kong and in toronto18 19 however human metapneumovirus was not consistently detected in other patients with sars in hong kong outside the prince of wales hospital or elsewhere globally in addition the genetic sequence of the human metapneumovirus isolated from these patients was essentially similar to that previously known to circulate in human beings as such it was difficult to explain why human metapneumovirus which was known to have been a human pathogen for many years would cause a novel and unusual disease syndrome such as sars rhinovirus and chlamydia were also detected in patients with suspected sars10 17 20
three laboratories within the who network independently reported the isolation of a novel coronavirus from clinical specimens of patients with sars14 17 20 in all three laboratories the strategies that led to the detection of this novel coronavirus were broadly similar although culture in cell lines including hep-2 mrc-5 mdck llc-mk2 hela rde nci-h292 hut-292 b95-8 and a549 that were usually used to culture respiratory viruses proved unproductive the virus was isolated in vero-e6 cells in two laboratories and frhk-4 cells in the other even before the nature of the virus was identified a link with sars was established by showing that serum samples from patients with suspected sars had increasing antibody titres to virus-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay iifa the identification of the agent as a coronavirus was made using thin-section electron microscopy of virus-infected cells and negatively stained preparations of cell-culture supernatants that were virus infected figure 1
 independent confirmation of the identity of the virus was obtained by sequencing fragments of the viral genome derived through random-primed rt-pcr in two laboratories and the use of consensus primers for coronaviruses in the other laboratory in all three laboratories the region that yielded the early sequence information was the open reading frame orf 1b region of the replicase gene possibly because this is a highly conserved region of the virus dna array analysis using a microarray containing probes for various virus families21 was done on infected and uninfected cells this analysis gave positive signals for a group of eight oligonucleotides whose sequence was derived from two virus families the coronaviridae and the astroviridae20 however microarray analysis could only be done once the virus was isolated in culture and could not be done directly on the clinical specimenthe independent detection by three laboratories of a coronavirus-like agent in samples from patients with sars-like disease in hong kong vietnam singapore and germany patient from singapore led particular credence to the significance of this observation however to conclusively establish a causal role for this novel coronavirus the virus had to be consistently found in the relevant clinical specimens from patients with the disease and not in healthy controls rt-pcr methods based on the initial genetic sequence of the virus replicase gene were designed and applied to detect viral rna in patients specimens the virus isolate was also used in iifas and eias to detect serological responses in acute and convalescent serum specimens with these approaches infection with the novel coronavirus subsequently named sars-associated coronavirus was detectable in 45 of 50 consecutive patients with clinically suspected sars in hong kong all 32 patients from whom paired serum samples were available had seroconverted to positive for sars coronavirus viral rna was not detectable by rt-pcr in healthy controls serum samples from 200 healthy blood donors in hong kong even though there was an outbreak of sars at the time did not have antibody that was reactive to cells infected with sars coronavirus in iifas14 a second study found evidence of sars coronavirus by rt-pcr or virus culture in 19 patients with sars from vietnam hong kong and singapore and nine patients from whom serum samples were available had increasing antibody titres to the virus20 furthermore 384 randomly selected serum samples from us blood donors had no reactivity to the sars coronavirus by eia20 a third study found all five patients with probable sars and three of 13 patients with suspected sars who originated from singapore and vietnam to have evidence of sars coronavirus rna by rt-pcr17 taken together these results indicated that the novel coronavirus was associated with sars and given the lack of serological reactivity in human beings suggested that it was probably recently introduced to the human population because on the basis of the partial genetic information available the virus seemed to be an agent not previously known to circulate in human populations the likely origin of the virus was from an animal sourcefulfilment of kochs postulates for establishing the cause of a disease requires that the microbe should be detected at the site of the disease sars coronavirus was detected in the lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage of a patient with sars by virus culture rt-pcr and electron microscopy10 17 20 in addition virus-like particles compatible in size and morphology to coronavirus were shown in lung biopsy tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage10 20 the lung pathology of fatal sars showed bronchial epithelial denudation loss of cilia type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and in patients who died later in the course of the disease syncytial cells were seen in the alveoli20 22 23 sars coronavirus rna was shown in the lungs by rt-pcr23 24 and in-situ hybridisation25 26 27 and viral antigen was detected in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages by immunohistology our unpublished data no evidence of human metapneumovirus was detected in the lungs by rt-pcr by electron microscopy or by a serological response in paired serum samples22 23
the final requirement for the fulfilment of kochs postulates to establish the cause of an infectious disease is reproduction of the disease in a relevant animal model infection of cynomolgous macaques with an isolate of sars coronavirus led to disease that was pathologically similar to that seen in human patients with sars with epithelial necrosis serosanguinous alveolar exudates hyaline membranes type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and the presence of syncytia28 29 the virus was successfully re-isolated from these lesions and an antibody response to the virus was shown in the infected animals by contrast infection of macaques with human metapneumovirus produced a mild suppurative rhinitis with minimal erosion in the infected airways28 the possibility remained that co-infection with human metapneumovirus could exacerbate the disease caused by sars coronavirus however there was no evidence of human metapneumovirus infection by rt-pcr or serological methods in patients with severe and fatal sars sars coronavirus was detected in these patients which suggested that human metapneumovirus was not necessary for development of severe or fatal sars23 in addition infection of macaques with sars coronavirus followed by human metapneumovirus did not produce enhanced disease28 thus it was concluded that sars coronavirus was both necessary and sufficient to cause the full syndrome of sars subsequently it was shown that sars coronavirus infects and replicates in cats and ferrets and can be transmitted to uninfected animals30 recently sars coronavirus has also been shown to infect and replicate in mice although without overt disease31 these experiments provide alternative animal models for the investigation of sars of these the macaque and ferret models show clinically significant diseasewithin weeks of the isolation of the novel coronavirus associated with sars the full genome of the virus was sequenced32 33 analysis of the genome of the sars coronavirus confirmed that it was completely novel across the whole of its length and was not derived by recombination between previously known animal or human coronaviruses this finding also confirmed that sars coronavirus could not have been artificially generated in the laboratory as a bioterrorist agentcoronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single positive-stranded rna genome all coronaviruses have five major orfs that encode the replicase spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins34 35 these viruses can be subdivided into three groups on the basis of antigenic and genetic studies all previously known human coronaviruses can be classified into group 1 eg 229e and group 2 eg oc43 sars coronavirus showed some serological cross-reactivity with antisera raised to human coronavirus 229e group 120 partial initial viral sequences of the viral replicase had indicated that sars coronavirus was genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses14 17 20 further characterisation of the full genome confirmed this deduction and suggested that the virus is distantly related to coronaviruses from groups 2 and 332 33 36 these findings prompted the conclusion that either the sars coronavirus represents a new fourth group within the coronavirus genus32 33 or that it represented a group 2 virus that had diverged from others in the group very early in evolution37 however unlike other group 2 viruses sars coronavirus does not contain a haemagglutinin-esterase protein encoding sequence further work is required to confirm the taxonomic classification of this virusthe availability of the full genetic sequence has allowed refinement of diagnostic assays see below rational antiviral drug design and vaccine development38 39
the recent introduction of a novel coronavirus in human beings without prior serological evidence of infection in the human population prompted much speculation about the origin of this virus whereas bioengineered or even extraterrestrial agents were adduced by some to explain its origin40 the most probable explanation was that it was an animal virus that had recently acquired the ability for human-human transmission this hypothesis was strengthened by reports that early patients with sars in guangdong were exposed to live wild game animals held in markets serving the restaurant trade for freshly cooked game meat5 7 a search for the animal source of the precursor virus was prompted figure 2
 sampling of several animal species found in one of the live-game markets in guangdong revealed that some of them carried a virus genetically and antigenically related to the human sars coronavirus41 in particular a sars-like coronavirus was detected by rt-pcr in the nasal and faecal swabs of civet cats paguma larvata and a raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides serological evidence of infection was found in these species and also in a chinese ferret-badger melogale moschata41 genetic sequencing of the virus revealed that the animal coronavirus had more than 99 homology with human sars coronavirus figure 3
 however when compared with the animal viruses the human sars coronavirus seemed to have a 29-nucleotide deletion in orf8 figure 4
 this additional sequence predicts that the animal virus will express a putative protein of 122 aminoacids that is not seen in the human sars coronavirus interestingly a subsequent study revealed other genotypes with similar deletions in the same orf42 in that study viruses with a 82-nucleotide deletion were isolated from the early phase of the epidemic in addition viruses with a 415-nucleotide deletion resulting in the loss of the whole orf8 region were found in may 2003 ie at the late phase of the outbreak these results indicated that the expression of orf8 is dispensable for the sars coronavirus in human beings alternatively it is also tempting to speculate that deletions in orf8 might give the virus an advantage to adaptation in human beingsanimal traders working with live animals in these markets had high seroprevalence for both the human and animal sars coronavirus although they did not have a history of sars-like disease41 43 the animal precursor of sars coronavirus is thus likely to be inefficient at infecting human beings and repeated exposure to the precursor animal virus probably leads to the abortive infection or antigenic stimulation that results in this observed serological response in the animal handlers these findings taken with the history of exposure to these same live-animal markets provided by some of the early patients with sars suggests that the live-animal markets were probably the site where the inter-species transfer of the animal virus to human beings occurredit seems that once the virus is introduced into such live-animal markets with a diverse fauna of small mammals the precursor sars coronavirus efficiently establishes itself in several small mammalian species studies with avian influenza viruses in live-poultry markets has shown that such viruses amplify within the setting of a market trading in live birds44 and it is likely that the precursor sars coronavirus does likewise in markets in which there is a diversity of mammalian species with animals being removed and added to the ecosystem on a regular basis45 however the reservoir of this virus in nature remains to be conclusively identified the palm civet or the raccoon dog are current candidates equally another species could be the reservoir of the virus in the wild while the civet cats and similar species serve as the amplifier of the disease in the setting of live-animal markets further work is required to identify the natural reservoir of this virusdetailed molecular epidemiological investigations indicate that the viruses detected in human beings in the early stages of the sars outbreak in guangdong are closely related to the animal sars coronavirus41 42 46 some viruses had the additional 29-nucleotide sequence that was seen in the animal viruses the early viruses were found to be genetically more diverse and more prone to mutation than viruses isolated later in the course of the outbreak which suggests that the sars coronavirus was in the process of host adaptation and was subjected to a high selection pressure during the early phase of the outbreak42 later in the outbreak the virus had presumably become more adapted to human-human transmission and one lineage of the virus had become dominant for example in feb-march 2003 there were at least four introductions of sars coronavirus from china to hong kong46 these were genetically diverse however both classic and molecular epidemiology suggests that only one of these viruses seems to have given rise to the major outbreak in hong kong that subsequently spread globally thus most of the sars coronaviruses isolated from patients in canada vietnam and singapore are genetically closely related to the virus isolated from a single sars patient in hong kong hku-33 whereas other genetic lineages seem to be less transmissible42 46 47 48 49 50
isolation of the causal agent and determination of its partial genome sequence provided the basis for the first generation of laboratory tests for sars14 17 20 rt-pcr tests were based on the orf1b sequence of sars coronavirus replicase gene the first part of the genome to be sequenced serological tests were based on the iifa of virus-infected cells and eias were based on viral cell extracts virus isolation was not very sensitive was labour intensive and took too long to be clinically relevant although these tests used in combination proved robust and useful for the retrospective diagnosis of sars they proved less satisfactory for providing a diagnosis in the first few days after disease onset51 52
the first generation of rt-pcr assays were more sensitive at the end of the first week of illness with only 3565 of specimens testing positive in the first few days of the disease51 53 54 55 however these assays provided important insights into the pathogenesis and transmission of the disease virus was detected by rt-pcr and by culture not only in the respiratory tract but also in the faeces and urine51 replication of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed by electron microscopic studies of biopsies of the upper and lower intestinal mucosa in patients with sars56 these findings suggested that infection with sars coronavirus was disseminated and not simply confined to the respiratory tract they also raised the possibility that the infection could be spread by the faecal route this route proved to be important in at least one major community outbreak amoy gardens in hong kong in which over 300 patients were infected within the period of a few days presumably through contaminated faeces57 quantitative rt-pcr assays on the nasopharyngeal aspirates as well as rates of positivity of first-generation rt-pcr assays at different stages of the illness showed that unlike other respiratory viral infections viral load and rates of positivity of sars coronavirus in the upper respiratory tract increased progressively to peak at around day 10 after disease onset51 53 54 55 58 these findings provided the reason why rt-pcr assays were of poor sensitivity early in the course of the disease they also predicted that virus transmission would be lower in the first few days of illness a finding supported by epidemiological observations59 whereas viral rna could be detected by rt-pcr for many weeks or even months after the onset of disease virus culture was only possible during the first 3 weeks of illness51 it is possible that even though virus replication continues after the first 3 weeks of disease the virus may be complexed with antibody and therefore no longer infective or transmissible this finding was also in agreement with epidemiological findingsapart from respiratory samples viral rna was also detected in stool blood cerebrospinal fluid and urine58 60 61 62 63 of these non-respiratory samples stool specimens had the highest proportion of positive rt-pcr results in one study 65 of 67 stool samples collected later in the illness mean 142 days were positive in conventional rt-pcr assays58 this observation agreed with the report that stool samples might be a good alternative to respiratory samples for the identification of sars patients55 however one study indicated that viral rna was not detectable in stool samples within the first 4 days of illness suggesting that stool samples might not be useful for early diagnosis of sars51
the low sensitivity of conventional rt-pcr assays in the first few days of disease the period during which laboratory diagnosis is most relevant for patient care prompted the exploration of several strategies to improve test sensitivity a quantitative real-time rt-pcr approach was used to improve sensitivity as well as turnaround time64 65 these methods had the benefit of being closed systems that reduced the chance of pcr cross-contamination within the laboratory more importantly the technology when combined with automated specimen extraction methods had the potential to become high throughput assays a significant advantage in areas with outbreaks of sars in which large numbers of specimens had to be tested in addition these assays provided quantitative viral load data which helped elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease for example these assays showed that viral load was highest in specimens of the lower respiratory tract eg bronchoalveolar lavage sputum endotracheal aspirates and was higher in nasopharyngeal aspirate than in throat swabs17 faecal samples had very high viral loads toward the end of the first week of illness and were the specimen of choice during the second week of disease66
other approaches were also used to enhance the detection rate of sars the sensitivity of detection could be increased by testing multiple serial samples collected from the same patient62 however this increased the already high workloads in clinical diagnostic laboratories real-time nested rt-pcr strategies were shown to be useful for detecting low copy numbers of sars coronavirus present in the early stage of illness67 68 the turnaround time for this method was much shorter than that for the conventional nested rt-pcr assay however nested rt-pcr increases the risk of laboratory cross-contamination leading to false-positive results69
in infected cells coronaviruses generate subgenomic mrna for the synthesis of structural viral protein by discontinuous transcription because of the genomic organisation of sars coronavirus all subgenomic mrna molecules contain the nucleocapsid gene sequence region of the sars coronavirus32 33 thus targeting the nucleocapsid gene sequence should be expected to enhance sensitivity of diagnosis this proved to be the case when applied to specimens collected from experimentally infected macaques29 however several independent studies on clinical specimens from patients with sars proved otherwise66 70 71 72 and showed that most of the viral rna in clinical specimens is of genomic origin66 however it was advisable to have rt-pcr assays that target different parts of the viral genome to serve as a confirmation of the positive result73 this strategy provides some assurance that a positive result is not due to laboratory contamination with pcr amplicongiven that the analytical sensitivity of rt-pcr assays could not be increased much further the only other option for enhancing test sensitivity was by increasing the amount of viral rna added to the rt-pcr reaction mix70 74 by extraction of rna samples from a larger volume of nasopharyngeal aspirate and by applying quantitative real-time rt-pcr technologies the sensitivity of sars-coronavirus detection improved to approximately 80 of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from day 13 of disease onset with 100 specificity75 this method was not necessarily associated with an increase in pcr inhibitors75 however this strategy implies that an inhibitor control is important to assure against a false-negative result due to pcr inhibitionin initial studies serum or plasma were not thought to be useful for molecular diagnosis of sars17 62 however subsequent studies on plasma and serum samples from sars patients showed that sars coronavirus rna was detectable in more than 50 of plasma and 78 of serum samples during the first week of illness70 in another study which used multiple serial plasma samples 79 of sars patients within the first 3 days of illness could be identified by quantitative rt-pcr76 a recent study showed that sars coronavirus rna was detectable and was claimed to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a sars patient during early disease61 whether the viral rna originated from infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or by phagocytosis or endocytosis of virus replicating the respiratory tract is still unclear nevertheless blood leucocytes may provide yet another alternative for early sars diagnosis however sars coronavirus viraemia occurs mainly within the first week of the disease77 in addition outside the period of a sars epidemic most respiratory infections are caused by other pathogens and a respiratory specimen still remains the most important clinical specimen for clinical investigationaccording to the results of first-generation rt-pcr assays patients with a positive rt-pcr result on admission had worse outcomes in terms of survival requirement for intensive care and assisted ventilation when compared with sars patients with negative rt-pcr results at admission53 this finding was presumably a surrogate for viral load early in the disease recently this hypothesis has been confirmed using quantitative rt-pcr and high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality viral load from patients who died from the disease was recently shown to be about 45 log higher than in patients who eventually recovered from the illness78 a high viral load is also associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea78 and the requirement for intensive care70 thus quantitative pcr assays might provide critical prognostic information for clinical management in particular if the viral load is a major predictor of clinical outcome effective antiviral therapy that helps to reduce viral load is likely to provide clinical benefitserodiagnosis is currently the gold standard for confirmation of a diagnosis of sars iifa using virus-infected cells spotted onto teflon-coated microwell slides51 or eia based on extracts of virus-infected cells coated on microwell eia plates have proved reliable methods for the diagnosis of sars79 however seroconversion usually occurred in weeks 2 or 3 of illness and a few patients seroconverted as late as 28 days after disease onset58 thus serology is not an option for early diagnosis of the disease detection of igm or iga subclass-specific antibody did not allow earlier diagnosis58 80 these tests require culture of live sars coronavirus to provide the relevant antigen used in the assays and require reliable inactivation of virus infectivity before they can be used outside biohazard level 3 containment recombinant viral nucleoprotein and spike protein antigens expressed in escherichia coli and other substrates have been assessed as alternative serological test platforms79 81 82 these have the potential for providing low cost reproducible and non-hazardous serological tests in an eia format that is amenable to high throughput testing79 83 84 however it should be borne in mind that each antigen and assay format must be individually tested to assess the possibility of cross-reaction with other related human coronaviruses whereas such serological cross-reactions did not prove to be a major problem with the whole native viral antigen assays mentioned above this should not be assumed to mean that recombinant antigens are equally specific until they have been shown to be so furthermore although serological cross-reactivity proved not be a problem during the period of the sars outbreak in the post-sars era when the prior probability of sars is extremely low a positive serological result must be treated with even greater caution in addition to the two known human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 a new human coronavirus has been discovered85 the possibility of cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses although rare is real and must be taken seriously furthermore individuals vary in the antigenic epitopes to which they produce antibodies hence cross-reactivity may well be a rare event although such a result if not interpreted with care may have major implications for public health we therefore suggest that all positive serological results should be confirmed by neutralisation tests in reference laboratoriesin periods in which there are no outbreaks of sars clinical specimens for investigation of sars should be tested with particular care positive rt-pcr results should be confirmed by an independent molecular test on a different specimen rt-pcr tests for different genome targets eg replicase gene and nucleoprotein gene should be available in reference laboratories to confirm positive results and for selective use in confirming negative results on patients on whom there is a high degree of suspicion serial specimens from many sites eg respiratory faeces and serum should be tested in addition to avoid obtaining false-negative results assays with internal pcr inhibitor control should be encouraged positive results should be confirmed in an independent reference laboratory serological assays should show a significant rise in antibody titres to native viral antigens eg iifa and be confirmed by virus neutralisation human infection with an animal sars-like coronavirus which is what we are most likely to encounter may behave atypically compared with sars for example the clinical disease may be milder and the viral load may be even lower and more transient than with sars this means even greater vigilance may be required in making the diagnosis of a infection with the sars-related animal coronaviruspossible options for the re-emergence of sars includes the undetected continued transmission of the virus from the outbreak in the summer of 2003 escape of the virus from laboratories that contain live sars coronavirus or the re-emergence of the virus from an animal reservoir there is at present no evidence for the virus persisting in the human population although the virus may be detected by rt-pcr in the faeces for months after the onset of disease51 virus isolation is rarely possible after the third week of illness and there is no evidence for disease transmission by patients in late convalescence the possibility that immunocompromised patients such as those with aids may harbour the virus long term has to be considered however if epidemiologically relevant transmission from such cases occurred sars should have been manifest by now given the intense global surveillance and awareness that now exists escape of the virus from a laboratory has indeed occurred on three occasions86 and highlights the importance of biosafety who has provided strict biohazard guidelines for the handling of this virus and its secure storage87 at least one of these events involved the handling of virus that was thought to be chemically inactivated86 88 thus researchers should use appropriate and internationally accepted methods for the inactivation of live viruses89 a detailed study on sars-coronavirus inactivation has been recently reported90 to prevent any inadvertent laboratory-acquired infection leading to secondary transmission in the community as happened after the laboratory infections in beijing88 a high level of alert for febrile and respiratory illness in all laboratory workers who handle infectious sars coronavirus needs to be maintainedthe re-emergence of the virus from its animal reservoir remains possible given that the virus is detectable in the faeces and respiratory secretions of small mammals within live-animal markets in southern china re-emergence in four patients with sars in guangdong in december 2003 and january 2004 and epidemiological genetic linkage to live-game markets and viruses isolated from them prompted the wholesale cull of civet cats and other small mammals in these markets in january 200491 no further human cases of sars acquired from animals have since been detected

validation of new immunologic tests aint easy its been said validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a particularly daunting task while we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic serologic testing for antibodies to sars-cov-2 has now come to the limelight sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on health care resources in the united states and many other countries specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion ie flatten the curve scientific experts governmental officials and other professionals have publicly advocated for sars-cov-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially reenter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus a test for detecting immune individuals who will not be reinfected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept but is it realisticthe temporary easing of food and drug administration fda marketinguse regulations has enabled the rapid expansion of accurate fast and reliable nucleic acid tests to identify acute infection with sars-cov-2 laboratory professionals diagnostic companies suppliers investigators and hospital administrators have all stepped up to manage acute supply shortages for critical testing components including instruments test-compatible swabs and nucleic acid extraction kits ensuring continued availability of reliable and timely test results as we approach the peak of severe disease prevalence in several regions according to comprehensive models developed by epidemiologists and statisticians we now are faced with a new laboratory crisis sars-cov-2 antibody testingnumerous antibody tests have recently become available serologic tests for antibodies to sars-cov-2 are typically based on lateral flow immunochromatography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa currently available tests predominantly target antibodies to 1 of 2 main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus  the nucleocapsid protein n and the spike protein s several assays focus on the s1 subunit of the spike protein which is somewhat specific to each coronavirus strain12 the s1 subunits host the binding domain for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is thought to be the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 gains entry into cells1 because the s1 subunit is highly immunogenic and its affinity for the ace2 receptor appears to correlate with infectivity1 it has been the target for sars-cov-2 serologic assays with reportedly high sensitivity and specificity23clinical implementation urgently requires validation of these new assays since real-life performance data are scarce the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has been marked by an inspiring level of interlaboratory collaboration at yale-new haven hospital we are particularly grateful for invaluable discussions and sharing of data with johns hopkins massachusetts general hospital mount sinai nyu-langone cornellcolumbia arup mayo clinic and many others scientific journals have contributed via the rapid dissemination of curated studies and preprint sites offer additional information that can be scrutinized in a shorter time frame prior to dedicated reviewer analysis the accumulation and exchange of valuable laboratory evidence has increased our understanding of the serologic testing landscape in a short period of time as a result we now know that individuals with symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection will generally not have detectable antibodies to sars-cov-2 within the first 7 days of the onset of symptoms34 the majority of hospitalized sars-cov-2-infected individuals with confirmed viral rna will have detectable igg antibodies 14 days and more certainly 28 days after the onset of symptoms with assay sensitivity and specificity in the high 90 percents5 total antibody concentration appears to rise to detectable levels first igm and iga both rise 1 to 2 days earlier than igg3 unpublished observations preliminary data suggests older individuals produce more robust antibody responses assays differ in overall performance but several methods being validated by large laboratories appear comparable one might therefore ask what exactly is the problemas valuable as this information is it may be insufficient to support critical decisions that providers managers administrators and governmental agencies will face especially regarding immunity in individuals who have remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during the pandemicto determine whether an individual is immune to sars-cov-2 we must know the pretest probability in the specific population being tested as well as the sensitivity and specificity for protective antibodies of the assay a significant challenge is that to date serologic data are largely limited to hospitalized ill patients there is reason to suspect that serologic findings in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic exposures may not correlate as well as in hospitalized patients particularly as anecdotal evidence suggests individuals with low viral loads produce lower antibody titers unpublished datain addition assessment of antibody effectiveness is problematic even in seriously ill patients approximately one-third of sars-cov-2-infected patients who developed antibodies during hospitalization have been reported to lack antibodies that neutralize virus in plaque growth assays considered the standard laboratory test for antibody effectiveness6 this implies an individual with antibodies may not be immune to reinfectionfinally a positive antibody result in a potentially immune individual does not guarantee noninfectious status there may be continuing active viral shedding particularly if their antibodies are nonneutralizing the molecular heterogeneity of sars-cov-2 subtypes7 could also have an effect on the sensitivity and specificity of serologic assays the imperfect performance of comparable more established serologic tests for other diseases eg toxoplasma igm may be acceptable because we have a much better understanding of the clinical scenarios unfortunately the same confidence does not hold true for sars-cov-2 serologic testingquality will play a pivotal role in ensuring we are able to obtain the data required to understand covid-19 immunity some of the serologic tests currently available are simply bound to be inferior and that needs to be documented the united kingdom abandoned large-scale purchasing of test kits when the kits failed to satisfy minimum validation metrics8 predictably online direct-to-consumer tests are being aggressively marketed without any published information to evaluate their clinical performance9 while some antigenic targets have shown minimal cross-reactivity with the 4 prevalent non-sars-cov-2 coronaviruses2 without validation studies there is a real risk that some assays may simply reflect prior exposure to the common cold fortunately reputable commercial entities with experienced scientists sophisticated equipment and good manufacturing practices have begun to release serologic assays under fda guidance commercial assays typically undergo extensive prerelease standardization including testing for interferences and matrix effects quality control and test results in large patient cohorts this sets the stage for acquisition of clinical and epidemiologic databut concerns remain when proposals call for testing populations different from those used to validate the assay what if a health care worker hcw who had a fever and no other symptoms 14 days ago wants to return to work and tests positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies can we assume with high confidence that this hcw is both immune and noninfectious if we are wrong then we have placed patients and coworkers at risk a failed prevention is also likely to erode faith in the integrity of laboratory tests for the disease we have heard the argument that any testing is better than none providing a path to restoring normalcy and the lack of which has high ongoing societal costs as laboratory professionals we can only respond that for anti-sars-cov-2 serology 1 bad assays will always be counterproductive 2 good assays have not been proven in the proposed test population and 3 more experience is needed to help us properly interpret the serologic test resultsregulatory and health officials appear to recognize these limitations eg return to work guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention currently do not include serologic testing the role of serologic testing in identifying potential donors for convalescent plasma remains to be fully investigated as does the therapeutic benefit of such an intervention in this setting but other uses for serologic testing may emerge one such clinical scenario where sars-cov-2 serologic assays may be particularly useful is when a positive serology is accompanied by repeatedly negative nucleic acid testing in the setting of a highly suggestive clinical presentation serology may provide the basis for specific therapies for covid-19 infection still until we understand the patterns of antibody response to sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic individuals and the correlation of antibody response with susceptibility to reinfection it seems prudent to apply caution to the criteria used to frame economic social and corporate policybiological variability is the bane of clinical pathology in the setting of validation and clinical application of serologic testing this variability presents a daily struggle reputable diagnostic companies and both commercial and academic clinical laboratories have repeatedly demonstrated that the value of dedication to testing quality ensures clinical utility health industry manufacturing experts engineers quality and regulatory managers sales professionals scientists and physicians have been working diligently under significant duress during the covid-19 pandemic to the great benefit of society as laboratory medicine professionals we must now leverage these efforts by ensuring that 1 serologic tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies perform as well as intended and 2 we provide information that enables health care providers administrators and health officials to best interpret and apply the available evidence at this point in the evolution of serologic testing for sars-cov-2 we must say in unison caveat emptortot voor enkele jaren geleden bestond er slechts een beperkte voorziening voor het overplaatsen van ic-behoeftige kinderen naar een picu het interklinisch transport werd veelal verzorgd door de insturend kinderarts of in sommige gevallen door een anesthesioloog van het insturend ziekenhuis deze persoon had in de meeste gevallen weinig tot geen ervaring met het transport van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen3 daarnaast beschikte men tijdens het transport niet of onvoldoende over de juiste apparatuur uit nederlands onderzoek bleek dan ook dat het voor het kind beter was als het interklinisch transport plaats zou vinden door een transportteam van de picu waar het kind zou worden opgenomen4
op grond van deze gegevens heeft de sectie intensive care kinderen van de nederlandse vereniging voor kindergeneeskunde een notitie opgesteld waarin de zorg voor ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen werd besproken5 deze notitie volgde op een beleidsnotitie met een soortgelijke strekking opgesteld door de inspectie voor de gezondheidszorg6 in beide notities werd gesproken over het transport van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen naar een picu dit leidde onder andere tot de afspraak om in 2006 een landelijk dekkend transportsysteem functionerend te hebbenuit diverse onderzoeken uitgevoerd in australi het verenigd koninkrijk en de verenigde staten blijkt dat de kwaliteit van zorg tijdens een interklinisch transport groter is als het transport begeleid wordt door een picu-team hiervoor is een aantal verklaringen te geven ten eerste de ruimere ervaring en scholing in het herkennen en behandelen van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen evenals kennis van het voortschrijden van het ziekteproces beyond the golden hour ten tweede het gebruik van de trolley met eigen materialen en als derde een veel lagere frequentie aan complicaties zoals bijvoorbeeld accidentele detubatie of onvoldoende sedatie tijdens transportnu functioneert in een aantal regios in nederland een 24-uurs transportsysteem voor ernstig zieke of gewonde gentubeerde kinderen bij patinten bij wie geen noodzaak tot endotracheale intubatie bestaat wordt het transport door het insturende ziekenhuis verzorgd het voordeel van het 24-uurssysteem is dat insturend artsen niet meer hoeven te zoeken naar een beschikbaar picu-bed als zij een patint over willen plaatsen naar hun regionale picu wordt contact gezocht en wordt de overname gerealiseerd in het geval van een niet te realiseren opname zorgt het regionale centrum voor opname op een andere picu inclusief het transport naar deze afdelingde insturende specialist blijft verantwoordelijk voor de primaire opvang van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen in toenemende mate hebben kinderartsen maar ook anesthesiologen en seh-artsen van perifere ziekenhuizen met succes deelgenomen aan de advanced pediatric life support apls-cursussen waarin de opvang van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen op gestructureerde wijze eigen wordt gemaakt de insturende specialist heeft telefonisch overleg met de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist over de conditie van het kind en de indicatie tot endotracheale intubatie daarnaast kan de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist adviezen geven omtrent de verdere stabilisatie van het kind het kind zal volgens de abc-methodiek gestabiliseerd worden de veiligheid van het transport net als de outcome van de patint wordt voor een groot deel bepaald door de kwaliteit van primaire opvang en stabilisatiehet picu-transportteam bestaat uit een kinderarts-intensivist of een anesthesioloog-kinderintensivist en een kinder-icverpleegkundige dit team is volledig op elkaar ingespeeld en kent elkaars functioneren vanuit de dagelijkse patintenzorg op die manier kan de picu-behandeling al beginnen op locatie continue scholing van deze personen in het vervoeren van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen is essentieelhet transportteam beschikt over een speciale trolley waarmee kinderen tot ongeveer 75 kilogram kunnen worden vervoerd de trolley is ingericht als een mobiele intensive care unit micu en is onder andere uitgerust met beademingsapparatuur bewakingsapparatuur en perfusoren voor het continu toedienen van medicatie zie foto 1 daarnaast wordt een uitgebreid arsenaal aan hulpmiddelen meegenomen die nodig zijn bij het waarborgen van de zorg voor ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen volgens de abc-systematiek zie foto 2 ook is een uitgebreid formularium aan medicamenten aanwezig


ouders kunnen tijdens het interklinisch transport niet mee in de ambulance daarom is een goede voorlichting aan de ouders voorafgaand aan vertrek essentieelde procedure rondom een transport is vrij strak georganiseerd en begint met de aanmelding van een patint door de insturende specialist de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist geeft zo nodig adviezen over de verdere stabilisatie van de patint en de indicatie tot intubatie deze indicatie wordt altijd in samenspraak met de insturende specialist gesteld veelal wordt geadviseerd om indien mogelijk de intubatie plaats te doen vinden op de operatiekamer onder zo gecontroleerd mogelijke omstandighedenin de tussentijd wordt het transportteam gewaarschuwd buiten kantooruren komen zij naar het ziekenhuis er vindt een korte overdracht plaats tussen de dienstdoende kinderarts- intensivist en het transportteam waarna het transportteam begint met de voorbereidingen voor het transport de brancard wordt gecontroleerd volgens een checklist de apparatuur wordt gecontroleerd en diverse medicamenten worden opgetrokken en klaargemaakt voor gebruik op de perfusor de arts van het transportteam maakt bij de meldkamer ambulance melding van een picu-transport waarop zo spoedig mogelijk een ambulance vrijgemaakt wordt de picu-transporten worden altijd uitgevoerd als a1-ritten dat wil zeggen dat altijd zwaailicht en sirene worden gevoerd het streven is om te vertrekken binnen n uur na melding door de insturende specialistbij aankomst van de ambulance vertrekt het transportteam naar het insturende ziekenhuis daar aangekomen volgt een korte medische en verpleegkundige overdracht van de patint waarna het transportteam de behandeling van de patint en daarmee ook de verantwoordelijkheid overneemt er wordt lichamelijk onderzoek verricht volgens het abcprincipe de apparatuur en de perfusoren worden ingesteld en vervolgens wordt de patint overgetild op de transportbrancard kleine kinderen zullen op een vacummatras worden geplaatst de patint wordt aangesloten op de ventilator en de bewakingsapparatuur er wordt dan wederom een kort lichamelijk onderzoek volgens het abc-principe verricht waarna het transportteam vertrekt in overleg met de ambulancechauffeur wordt bepaald hoe er wordt teruggereden naar het eigen centrum niet zelden zal begeleiding van het korps landelijke politiediensten noodzakelijk zijn bij terugkomst in het eigen ziekenhuis wordt de patint overgetild en aangesloten op de apparatuur de patint wordt overgedragen aan de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist het transportteam is vervolgens verantwoordelijk voor het reinigen en aanvullen van de brancard zodat het direct gebruiksklaar is voor een volgend transportsinds 2004 functioneert het transportsysteem in de regio amsterdam waarbij 60 procent van de transportdiensten verzorgd wordt door het academisch medisch centrum en 40 procent door het vu medisch centrum in heel 2004 werden 97 kinderen door een van beide transportteams vervoerd naar een picu respiratoire insufficintie was bij ongeveer 55 procent de primaire reden van opname meer dan de helft van de transporten 56 procent vond plaats buiten kantooruren of op weekenddagengemiddeld duurt een transport twee uur waarbij het transportteam ongeveer 45 tot 60 minuten aanwezig was in het verwijzende ziekenhuis tijdens de transporten hebben zich geen noemenswaardige problemen voorgedaanop zondagavond omstreeks elf uur wordt een 15-jarig meisje aangemeld met het beeld van een septische shock door de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist worden behandelingsadviezen gegeven en wordt het transportteam gealarmeerd rond n uur s nachts arriveert het transportteam dat de patint beoordeelt er is sprake van een ernstige septische shock met een zeer ernstige ards de patint wordt zowel centraal veneus als arterieel opgelijnd er worden diverse vaatvullingen gegeven en vaso-actieve medicatie wordt gestart tevens wordt de beademing fors aangepast uiteindelijk vertrekt het transportteam rond half vier in de ochtend de patint heeft hoge beademingsvoorwaarden peep 20 fio2 10 en forse inotrope ondersteuning dopamine 20 mcgkgmin en noradrenaline 04 mcgkgmin bij gebrek aan plaats in het eigen centrum wordt de patint vervoerd naar een ander ziekenhuis waar men om half vijf arriveert gedurende het transport doen zich geen noemenswaardige problemen voor om half acht s ochtends is het transportteam terug in het eigen centrumrond het middaguur op een maandag wordt melding gemaakt van een vier weken oude baby die respiratoir insufficint is geworden op basis van een rsv respiratoir syncytiaal virus pneumonie door de dienstdoende kinderarts- intensivist worden behandelingsadviezen gegeven en wordt het transportteam gealarmeerd de baby wordt onder gecontroleerde omstandigheden op de operatiekamer gentubeerd door de anesthesioloog bij aankomst in het insturende ziekenhuis wordt de baby onderzocht overgetild op de transportbrancard en aangesloten op de apparatuur er zijn geen verdere interventies noodzakelijk ruim twee uur na de initile melding is het transportteam weer terug in het eigen centrum en wordt de picu-behandeling voortgezeternstig zieke of gewonde kinderen bij wie een noodzaak tot endotracheale intubatie bestaat dienen door een picutransportteam vervoerd te worden naar een picu het vervoer van deze patinten door artsen en verpleegkundigen die zijn opgeleid en getraind in het handelend optreden bij ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen n het gebruik van speciaal materieel heeft een gunstig effect op zowel morbiditeit als mortaliteitvalidation of new immunologic tests aint easy its been said validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a particularly daunting task while we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic serologic testing for antibodies to sars-cov-2 has now come to the limelight sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on healthcare resources in the united states and many other countries specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion ie flatten the curve scientific experts governmental officials and other professionals have publicly advocated for sars-cov-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially re-enter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus a test for detecting immune individuals who will not be re-infected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept but is it realisticthe temporary easing of fda marketinguse regulations has enabled the rapid expansion of accurate fast and reliable nucleic acid tests to identify acute infection with sars-cov-2 laboratory professionals diagnostic companies suppliers investigators and hospital administrators have all stepped up to manage acute supply shortages for critical testing components including instruments test-compatible swabs and nucleic acid extraction kits ensuring continued availability of reliable and timely test results as we approach the peak of severe disease prevalence in several regions according to comprehensive models developed by epidemiologists and statisticians we now are faced with a new laboratory crisis sars-cov-2 antibody testingnumerous antibody tests have recently become available serologic tests for antibodies to sars-cov-2 are typically based on lateral flow immunochromatography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa currently available tests predominantly target antibodies to 1 of 2 main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus  the nucleocapsid protein n and the spike protein s several assays focus on the s1 subunit of the spike protein which is somewhat specific to each coronavirus strain12 the s1 subunits host the binding domain for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is thought to be the mechanism by which sars-cov gains entry into cells1 because the s1 subunit is highly immunogenic and its affinity for the ace2 receptor appears to correlate with infectivity1 it has been the target for sars-cov-2 serologic assays with reportedly high sensitivity and specificity23clinical implementation urgently requires validation of these new assays since real-life performance data are scarce the covid-19 pandemic has been marked by an inspiring level of inter-laboratory collaboration at yale-new haven hospital we are particularly grateful for invaluable discussions and sharing of data with johns hopkins massachusetts general hospital mount sinai nyu-langone cornellcolumbia arup mayo clinic and many others scientific journals have contributed via the rapid dissemination of curated studies and preprint sites offer additional information that can be scrutinized in a shorter time frame prior to dedicated reviewer analysis the accumulation and exchange of valuable laboratory evidence has increased our understanding of the serologic testing landscape in a short period of time as a result we now know that individuals with symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection will generally not have detectable antibodies to sars-cov-2 within the first 7 days of the onset of symptoms34 the majority of hospitalized sars-cov-2-infected individuals with confirmed viral rna will have detectable igg antibodies 14 days and more certainly 28 days after the onset of symptoms with assay sensitivity and specificity in the high 90 percents5 total antibody concentration appears to rise to detectable levels first igm and iga both rise 12 days earlier than igg3 unpublished observations preliminary data suggests older individuals produce more robust antibody responses assays differ in overall performance but several methods being validated by large laboratories appear comparable one might therefore ask what exactly is the problemas valuable as this information is it may be insufficient to support critical decisions that providers managers administrators and governmental agencies will face especially regarding immunity in individuals who have remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during the pandemicto determine whether an individual is immune to sars-cov-2 we must know the pre-test probability in the specific population being tested as well as the sensitivity and specificity for protective antibodies of the assay a significant challenge is that to date serological data are largely limited to hospitalized ill patients there is reason to suspect that serological findings in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic exposures may not correlate as well as in hospitalized patients particularly as anecdotal evidence suggests individuals with low viral loads produce lower antibody titers unpublishedin addition assessment of antibody effectiveness is problematic even in seriously ill patients approximately one-third of sars-cov-2-infected patients who developed antibodies during hospitalization have been reported to lack antibodies that neutralize virus in plaque growth assays considered the standard laboratory test for antibody effectiveness6 this implies an individual with antibodies may not be immune to reinfectionfinally a positive antibody result in a potentially immune individual does not guarantee non-infectious status there may be continuing active viral shedding particularly if their antibodies are non-neutralizing the molecular heterogeneity of sars-cov-2 subtypes7 could also have an effect on the sensitivity and specificity of serologic assays the imperfect performance of comparable more established serologic tests for other diseases eg toxoplasma igm may be acceptable because we have a much better understanding of the clinical scenarios unfortunately the same confidence does not hold true for sars-cov-2 serologic testingquality will play a pivotal role in ensuring we are able to obtain the data required to understand covid-19 immunity some of the serologic tests currently available are simply bound to be inferior and that needs to be documented great britain abandoned large-scale purchasing of test kits when the kits failed to satisfy minimum validation metrics8 predictably online direct-to-consumer tests are being aggressively marketed without any published information to evaluate their clinical performance9 while some antigenic targets have shown minimal cross-reactivity with the 4 prevalent non-sars-cov-2 coronaviruses2 without validation studies there is a real risk that some assays may simply reflect prior exposure to the common cold fortunately reputable commercial entities with experienced scientists sophisticated equipment and good manufacturing practices have begun to release serologic assays under fda guidance commercial assays typically undergo extensive pre-release standardization including testing for interferences and matrix effects quality control and test results in large patient cohorts this sets the stage for acquisition of clinical and epidemiologic databut concerns remain when proposals call for testing populations different than those used to validate the assay what if a healthcare worker hcw who had a fever and no other symptoms 14 days ago wants to return to work and tests positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies can we assume with high confidence that this hcw is both immune and non-infectious if we are wrong then we have placed patients and co-workers at risk a failed prevention is also likely to erode faith in the integrity of laboratory tests for the disease we have heard the argument that any testing is better than none providing a path to restoring normalcy and the lack of which has high ongoing societal costs as laboratory professionals we can only respond that for anti-sars-cov-2 serology a bad assays will always be counterproductive b good assays have not been proven in the proposed test population and c more experience is needed to help us properly interpret the serologic test resultsregulatory and health officials appear to recognize these limitations eg return to work guidelines from the cdc currently do not include serologic testing the role of serologic testing in identifying potential donors for convalescent plasma remains to be fully investigated as is the therapeutic benefit of such an intervention in this setting but other uses for serologic testing may emerge one such clinical scenario where sars-cov-2 serologic assays may be particularly useful is when a positive serology is accompanied by repeatedly negative nucleic acid testing in the setting of a highly suggestive clinical presentation serology may provide the basis for specific therapies for covid-19 infection still until we understand the patterns of antibody response to sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic individuals and the correlation of antibody response with susceptibility to re-infection it seems prudent to apply caution to the criteria used to frame economic social and corporate policybiological variability is the bane of clinical pathology in the setting of validation and clinical application of serologic testing this variability presents a daily struggle reputable diagnostic companies and both commercial and academic clinical laboratories have repeatedly demonstrated that the value of dedication to testing quality ensures clinical utility health industry manufacturing experts engineers quality and regulatory managers sales professionals scientists and physicians have been working diligently under significant duress during the covid-19 pandemic to the great benefit of society as laboratory medicine professionals we must now leverage these efforts by ensuring that a serologic tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies perform as well as intended and b we provide information that enables healthcare providers administrators and health officials to best interpret and apply the available evidence at this point in the evolution of serologic testing for sars-cov-2 we must say in unison caveat emptorin early december 2019 a novel human coronavirus was identified as the agent responsible for the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin in wuhan capital of hubei province china1 the virus was classified as a wrapped rna betacoronavirus2 which was readily called sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 223the sars-cov-2 infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 documented both in hospitals and in home structures1 the world health organization who on january 12 2020 declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on march 11 who assessed that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic the sars-cov-2 infection has been extremely contagious with over 2314621 infected people and 157847 death cases confirmed in laboratories since april 20 20204 it has been rapidly spreading all over the world with minor local differences inducing a progressive growth in the number of patients who need access to emergency departments and an increasing demand in diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection5the covid-19 pandemic is more than a public health emergency it is a financial and political crisis afflicting every nation in the world to date millions of people stay at home worldwide to minimize transmission of sars-cov-2 except healthcare workers and workers employed in essential services such as food production transport and delivery police firefighters and others267in the meantime that social isolation lockdown prevents and controls the pandemic diffusion to mitigate sars-cov-2 spreading states economies get in serious troubles and many governments are looking to find a good balance between prevention of sars-cov-2 disease and a soften up lockdown to restart industrial production and limit gross domestic product loss in the absence of a vaccine authorities have to find a way to reach the best compromise between covid-19 prevention and lockdown economic and social impact8 indeed it is well known that isolation in the elderly may increase the risk of cardiovascular autoimmune and neurocognitive diseases together with mental health problems not only these but many other important social aspects of peoples daily life have to be considered education stress and family conflicts and job lost911 schools have been suspended nationwide in 188 countries according to the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization and over 90 enrolled learners 15 billion young people are now out of education it should be considered that childrens daily routines are important in particular for those with special needs eg children with autism children and adolescents living in isolation in abusive homes are in danger during this time of economic uncertainty and stress12 finally distance-learning educational activities are not available to everyone and are a source of inequity worldwide13moreover how to manage surgical patients during covid-19 pandemic is still a matter of debate with a tremendous impact on the surgery units organization and productivity14 to date all patients must be judged as potentially positive in consideration of the high estimated number of asymptomatic subjects and of the maximum contagiousness that occur 23 days immediately preceding the onset of symptoms recently it has been shown that surgery performed on patients unaware of being infected and in the incubation phase determines a 20 increasing risk in postoperative mortality and 50 in post-surgery intensive care unit hospitalization possibly because surgery led to an inflammatory process acceleration causing covid-19 progression15currently sars-cov-2 rna detection in the nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage bal together with some hematological parameters and chest computed tomography ct are the primary tools for confirmation of covid-19 clinical suspicion8 detection of viral nucleic acid takes place by real-time quantitative pcr rt-qpcr method inside authorized laboratories with biological safety class 2 however rt-qpcr kits can give some false-negative results depending on swab sampling and extraction method and on the possibility that virus even if present in the individuals is not detectable in nosepharynx mucous membrane16 recently some studies described a discrepancy between the diagnostic power of rt-qpcr and ct the latter being more sensitive8 incidence of false negatives at molecular tests sometimes force repetition of the same up to three times in clinically suspected covid-19 patients andor with a covid-19 ct scan pattern8 new more user-friendly molecular tests are on the horizon for out of the lab sars-cov-2 rna screening utilizing heating unextracted diagnostic samples obliterate nuclease and cards to run clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprs methods as dna endonuclease targeted crisprs trans reporter17 in this context a great debate is ongoing about the role of serological assays able to detect igg iga or igm anti-sars-cov-2 in serum plasma or capillary blood to have a clear picture of the outbreak size in each country to assess the degree of immunization and to support the decision to re-admit people at work18 several serological assays have been developed since the beginning of covid-19 pandemic including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa rapid antibody immunochromatographic tests point-of-care test poct-fluorescence assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays clias18 more than 120 different diagnostic kit brands have been proposed on the market many are ce european community approved to date very few are food and drug administration fda approved1920 serological tests to detect antibodies against viral antigens are not yet widely used during this pandemic but rather in a leopard spot manner in publics and private laboratories however they could be as useful as they were during sars epidemic of 200221 and some studies demonstrate the anti-sars-cov-2 iggigm presence in clinically confirmed cases with negative rt-qpcr results22 serological tests are cheaper than molecular tests require a shorter analytical time and productivity can be much greater than molecular tests in case of automated instruments in medium-large hospital laboratories employing clia and elisaserological tests for specific sars-cov-2 antibodies detection in patients blood are currently important to a trace contacts b activate serological surveillance at the local regional and national level and c identify those who have already had contact with virus23 assuming there is protective immunity serological information can be used to decide return at work of infected workers especially people who work in environments in which they can potentially be exposed to sars-cov-2 eg health professionals unfortunately majority of in vitro diagnostic ivd companies do not report nature of the antigens utilized in the assays and then it is difficult to understand whether antibodies detected with different kits and methodologies have a neutralizing effect on the virus possibly through binding with the viral spike protein s subunits receptor-binding domain rbd2425 in addition serological tests can be used retrospectively in post-mortem diagnosis and finally they can be eventually used together with molecular tests for improving their diagnostic accuracy furthermore in the near future serological tests could play a role in the efficacy evaluation of any identified vaccines26 although igm antibodies generation may occur as rapidly as the viral genetic material in the respiratory tract generally the timing of immunoglobulin production from 4 days after the onset of symptoms to 1014 days limits its applicability in the acute phase diagnosis2728 nevertheless it should be pointed out that molecular tests represent an instantaneous picture of possible virus presence whereas serological tests display virus presence during a wider phase of the infectious process whether or not it reaches a clinical relevance moreover in particularly serious cases the use of serological tests in titration of convalescent patients hyperimmune plasma cannot be excluded once the antibodies ability to neutralize the virus has been established after considering all possible side effects of this treatment29 about that fda is coordinating a national effort to develop blood-based antibody-rich covid-19 therapies serological tests through the study of humoral response profile and clinical observations may also contribute to definition of igg serum concentration suitable for a subject to be immune as well as the persistence time of any immunizationbased on all the above considerations the aim of this study was to compare and to evaluate different serological tests diagnostic accuracy two different immunochromatographic card tests an immunofluorescence chromatographic card test and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay test able to detect anti-sars-cov-2 igg and igm in healthy controls and in covid-19 patients monitored at tor vergata university covid-hospital of romefrom march 16 to 23 april 2020 in our hospital were performed 9414 nasopharyngeal swabs mean age 554  190 years with 1085 rt-qpcr sars-cov-2-positive results mean age 621  187 years at first card 1 was the only available method for serological screening of nurses physicians and other healthcare workers the test was performed on about 1200 people and to evaluate card 1 serological specificity and sensitivity we collected blood samples related to people analyzed by rt-qpcr at least after 4 days from the execution of the nasopharyngeal swab we selected 307 samples as follows 82 with rt-qpcr nasopharyngeal-positive swabs mean age 634  157 years and 225 with rt-qpcr nasopharyngeal-negative swabs mean age 545  195 years on this cohort specificity was 100 but sensitivity was lower 536 and 769 for igm and igg respectively although commercial manufacturers claim their tests have high sensitivity and specificity many of them have not published on field validation studies yet later on with other tests becoming available we decided to compare the anti-sars-cov-2 igg and igm detection sensitivity and specificity among different methods and kits two immunochromatographic card tests named card 1 and card 2 fig 1a one immunofluorescence chromatographic card test card 3 fig 1b and one chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay clia at this purpose we collected 43 positive samples from covid-19 patients with rt-qpcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection mean age 631  130 years and 40 control subjects negative to nasopharyngeal swabs rt-qpcr mean age 499  128 yearsspecificity and sensitivity were calculated using receiver operating characteristic roc curves for semi-quantitative tests and with formulas reported under materials and methods for qualitative cards results with the analytical parameters for each test area under curve auc sensitivity and specificity are shown in table 1 they have been correlated to the manufacturers cut-off and recalculated on a best fit cut-off that emerged from our data analysisthe roc curves have optimal auc values close to 1 for igg detection in card 3 and clia 0981 and 0997 respectively auc values for igm detection are moderately lower 0921 and 0943 respectively fig 2moreover our data displays an excellent specificity for all the immunocromatographic tests 100 with a slight decrease in the igm specificity of clia 94 on the other hand igg sensitivities are about 90 for all tests with better performances for card 3 and clia 93 and 95 respectively igm sensitivities are lower around 84 with a best performance of card 2 878 and a low value for card 1 614 interestingly with our recalculated best fit cut-off 054 cutoff index coi instead of 1 coi clia igm sensitivity increased from 84 to 91due to the rapid spreading of covid-19 pandemic many molecular and serological detection tools have been rapidly developed818263033 laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection was based on rt-qpcr-positive results34 however molecular tests carried out through swabs can also be negative in people who harbor the virus because swab collection and time of sampling are critical in severe cases the most suitable samples showing a higher rna-positive rate seem to be bal or deep sputum35 and who recommends to repeat a negative test under a strong clinical suspicionmoreover the great sanitary and social pressure increased the request in the number of tests carried out in laboratories leading to a worldwide shortage of kits and reagents therefore today ivd companies are getting in trouble in delivering an adequate number of tests to cover all laboratories needs for this reason who and centers for disease control and prevention recommend a prioritization of testing policy36 of course the sustainability grade of covid-19 screening in different countries may determine serious inequitiesthe most used viral proteins as antigens in the available serological assays are as follows nucleocapsid protein n transmembrane spike protein s or protein s subunits rbd37 whatever the method used nature of the antigen is important considering that detection of antibodies directed against spike protein or its subunits are more likely to have a neutralizing activity and would better describe the immunization state according to these observations our samples higher sensitivities were obtained with the assays based on the presence of both n and s proteins therefore this information should be reported on kit datasheets but several times it is missingbased on our good analytical performance results for all tested methods it should be pointed out that chemiluminescence assays are fully automated and can be run in total automation laboratories also limiting technologists exposition to blood samples about laboratory safety of technologists engaged in routine hematologybiochemistry we are confident that these procedures are not deemed to be aerosol generating moreover viraemia does not appear to be a significant feature of mild-to-moderate covid-19 and where viral rna has been detected this has been at a low level nevertheless viraemia may be a feature in more severe covid-19 although current data are conflicting about that however it is strongly recommended to wear face masks gloves disposable coats and protective glasses mandatory safety set in italian clinical laboratories regarding immunochromatographic cards they are fully manual and the reading is subjective whereas immunofluorescence cromatographic cards set up is manual but the reading is accomplished through a fluorescence detector traceability is complete in clia and in fluorescence assays furthermore both of them are able to send results directly to laboratory information system we strongly suggest to revise the cut-off values reported on datasheets by companies because sometimes they are calculated in a small number of subjects belonging to a specific ethnicity or region in addition given the large number of certified companies able to produce and distribute serological kits each of them should be first tested and validated by accredited laboratoriesin each context relying on the instruments on the available economic investments and on the wideness of screenings all different methods described can be utilized considering the limits of each one for example screening sustainability should take into account the costbenefit ratio assuming the cost of one immunochromatographic card igg  igm as 10 the cost of an immunofluorescence card as 15 igg  igm and the cost of clia igg  igm as 20 nevertheless different strategies can be chosen depending on the target support to diagnosis with igm or serological screening and epidemiology studies with only igg finally considering the advantage that immunochromatographic cards are ready-to-use and time-saving38 in some contexts may be easier to analyze capillary blood rather than collect centrifuge transport and store blood samples airports prisons religious communities sports associations and centers for the elderly in our study we used serum also in the immunocromatographic cards so we cannot completely exclude different performances with capillary bloodat present most countries are in some form of lockdown with journeys severely restricted and reduced to essential trips only these security measures reduce disease transmission by reducing the number of susceptible persons in the population or by reducing the basic reproductive number r0 that is modulated by such factors as duration of viral shedding infectiousness of the organism individuals at stage i stealth carriers and contacts matrix between infected and susceptible persons39 moreover given that serological assay sensitivities in our study around 94 and 84 for igg and igm respectively implicate a number of false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments the only currently available procedure to reduce sars-cov-2 transmission is to identify and to isolate persons who are contagiousat this purpose we would like to submit a proposal for a flowchart in which serological tests are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase fig 3 the flowchart shows two different paths as follows in the first there are subjects who have always been asymptomatic in the second there are patients who have overcome the disease serology is integrated with nasopharyngeal rt-qpcr swab when necessary to exclude topical virus presence it is true that there is no 100 guarantee of virus-free among the groups tested with serological and molecular assays but in the flowchart we propose a 2-week preventive quarantine and a second serological iggigm assay before re-admitting people at work taking into account that no test method is perfect and there are still a lot of unknown elements for this virus social distancing should be kept for a longer time especially before a valid vaccine or therapy are established in fact it will be still highly suggested that people finally labeled as return to work should continue to use personal protections such as face mask frequent hand-washing and keeping necessary physical distances with each other the median day of serum conversion for both igg and igm has been calculated 13 days after symptom onset2740 so the preventive security measures together with the double igg and igm serological testing one at the beginning of the quarantine and one after 2 weeks can be helpful for recovery of activities in less time and in safety obviously the span of natural immunization is still unknown and will be determined in the future through clinical and serological follow-up for this reason we prudently suggest a time of 3 months for testing igg-positive subjects considering a sars-cov-2 epidemic duration of at least 6 months reported during 2002 sars epidemic41finally prevalence is currently determined on the number of subjects with positive rt-qpcr nasopharyngeal swabs then the real prevalence is probably much higher if we compare the most affected northern italy region covid-19 prevalence lombardia 067 to a center italy region prevalence lazio 009 the positive predictive value of serological tests would be extremely low in the second case serological screening should therefore be performed first on an epidemiologically significant population sample to define the usefulness of a more massive screening42 in italy such population serological sample screening 150000 subjects will be carried on by may 2020 to establish covid-19 prevalence in each different region and to support the management of the so-called phase twothe flowchart proposed in this work emphasize the importance of serological tests and manage resources for resuming activities and overcoming lockdownin particular for wide screenings through blood sampling including surgical patients we recommend to adopt clia methods in large hospital laboratories working in total automation immunochromatographic cards could be utilized during sampling in specific contexts outside the hospitals such as follows high prevalence areas airports police and military forces stations prisons immigrants homeless religious and other communities nevertheless from a public health perspective testing for igg anti-sars-cov-2 presence could determine who has been exposed to better define the possibility of asymptomatic infections and to give us a more reliable case counts and mortality estimates and a useful tool to control the restarting phaselastly in a very less time all countries will be challenged by phase two but until the neutralizing effect of

allocation during the experimentthe identification by us public health officials of presumptive covid-19 cases believed to be due to community transmission of this infection brings into sharp focus the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 15 the current recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 from the cdc are that clinicians coordinate this testing with local public health authorities andor the cdc the preferred testing method is the real-time reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr test 68 similar to that developed for the diagnosis of sars-cov 9 10 viral cultures are not recommended this commentary addresses current issues for the laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 that must be understood by clinicians clinical microbiology laboratories and public health authoritiesi initial respiratory tract specimen collection for diagnosis and screening of patients with covid-19 pneumonia within 5 to 6 days of the onset of symptoms patients with covid-19 have demonstrated high viral loads in their upper and lower respiratory tracts 1114 a nasopharyngeal np swab andor an oropharyngeal op swab are often recommended for screening or diagnosis of early infection 9 12 15 a single np swab has become the preferred swab as it is tolerated better by the patient and is safer to the operator np swabs have an inherent quality control in that they usually reach the correct area to be tested in the nasal cavity wang et al have just reported that op swabs n  398 were used much more frequently than nasal swabs n  8 in china during the covid-19 outbreak however the sars-cov-2 rna was detected in only 32 of op swabs which was significantly lower than the level in nasal swabs 63 16 while collectiontesting of both nasal and op swabs either as independent specimens or together within a single aliquot of viral transport medium might be an attractive option under normal circumstances institutions must also consider the potential stress that this pandemic places on nationalinternational supply chains in this light another excellent reason to limit testing with np swabs is to prolong supplies of flocked swabs andor transport media however as we understand more about respiratory and oral contact routes of transmission we may learn that patients with pharyngitis as a dominant initial presenting symptom can be adequately sampled via the op routein order to properly obtain an np swab specimen the swab must be inserted deeply into the nasal cavity patients will likely flinch but that means the swab has hit the target swabs should be kept in place for 10 s while being twirled three times swabs should have flocked nontoxic synthetic fibers such as polyester as well as synthetic nylon handles 17 collecting an npop swab specimen may carry a theoretical risk of transmitting sars-cov-2 particularly if airborne transmission is demonstrated as the investigation of the covid-19 outbreak continues 18 if personal protective equipment ppe cannot be utilized due to scarcity of such ppe other means of collecting upper respiratory tract specimens will be needed 18 one alternative option for collecting an upper respiratory tract specimen to evaluate patients with suspected covid-19 pneumonia is a self-collected saliva specimen 1922 should the supply of swabs become scarce other nonflocked swabs and transport media have been cleared equivalently by the food and drug administration fda under an emergency use authorization eua but head-to-head comparisons are lacking currentlyafter collection swabs should be placed in viral universal transport medium for rapid transportation to the clinical microbiology laboratory ideally under refrigerated conditions 17 it should be noted however that in some cases salivanpsops may miss early infection and that in later infection the main site of replication may have shifted to the low respiratory tract repeated testing or obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens may be required moreover other respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses must be ruled out in many ways covid-19 highlights the key difference between analytic and clinical sensitivities that is the ability of an assay to detect a pathogen when it is present in a clinical specimen versus the ability of a test to identify a patients overall infected status the latter of course reflects various other factors that include the specimen site and method of collection in conjunction with the burden of organism as a function of anatomic location disease severity and time symptomatic and variability of these factors from individual to individual repeated testing may be particularly important if a patient has a clinical picture of viral pneumonia a potential exposure history andor radiographic findings chest computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri scan consistent with covid-19 pneumonia equally challenging are how the results of a single undetected result should impact decisions regarding patient quarantine and social distancing in particular when the patients themselves are health care providers including clinical laboratory staff serology as discussed in the postanalytical section may assist in such situationsii late detection and monitoring of patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia ideally sputum sampling or bronchoalveolar lavage should be used for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens as they have yielded the highest viral loads for the diagnosis of covid-19 18 23 a recent study revealed that samples bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid yielded the highest sars-cov-2 rna rate although this study did not compareevaluate results from np swabs 16 patients who present with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may require emergent intubation as well as respiratory isolation in a negative-pressure room if possible a lower respiratory tract sputum specimen should be collected during the intubation procedure alternatively sputum andor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens can be collected after intubation 9 11however some patients with covid-19 pneumonia have demonstrated high viral rna loads of sars-cov-2 in fecal material 24 25 as well as delayed shedding from the respiratory tract 4 18 late in their clinical course enteric involvement previously has been seen in patients with severe novel coronavirus infections 9 2632 in four such studies sars coronavirus was isolated from stool cultures 26 28 31 in another study sars coronavirus was demonstrated inside enterocytes by electron microscopy 30 thus aside from direct respiratory sampling the preferred method for detecting sars-cov-2 in advanced covid-19 cases may be a rectal swab and real-time rt-pcr 9 2628 3032iii safety measures for specimen processing for pcr processing and testing processing of respiratory specimens should be done in a class ii biological safety cabinet 6 9 10 although some laboratories would argue that biosafety level three bsl-3 work procedures should be used and that the safety cabinet should be in a negative-pressure room within the laboratory such as that used for mycobacterial cultures for nucleic acid extraction before real-time rt-pcr is performed the specimen should be transferred to lysis buffer under this bsl-2 cabinet the lysis buffer should contain a guanidinium-based inactivating agent as well as a nondenaturing detergent indeed the buffers included in common commercial extraction platforms such as the biomrieux easymag or qiagen ez1 do contain guanidiumdetergents and are able to inactivate any viable coronavirus 3335 similarly universal transport medium that includes guanidinium salt is available from merlin biomedical xiamen china httpwwwchinamerlincomenindexphppproductsshowid166sidcid68lanmu2 because this test is a reverse transcription method the salivaswabs used to collect the clinical specimens should be quickly added to lysis buffer to disinfect the specimen as well as to stop degradation of the coronavirus rna 6 9 10 the clinical specimensswabs should not be heated to 56c for 30 min as evidence suggests that this process may also degrade the coronavirus rna even as it inactivates viable coronavirus 9 36moreover self-enclosed systems integrating nucleic acid extraction amplification and detection such as id now abbott san diego ca 37 38 cobas liat roche molecular systems pleasanton ca and genexpert cepheid sunnyvale ca 39 when available and meeting local regulatory requirements for sars-cov-2 testing will be very useful once the clinical specimen in viral transport medium is transferred into a cartridge in a class ii biosafety cabinet the cartridge is sealed many of these random-access sealed devices are suitable for point-of-care testing for local hospitals and clinics without biosafety cabinets in this situation the specimen collector in appropriate protective gear splash guardgoggles mask gloves and disposable laboratory coat could directly transfer the specimen into detection cartridges at bedside or in a location without a class ii biosafety cabinet and the closed cartridge could be safely placed on an instrument for testing however spills of transport solution during transfer to these cartridge-based tests should be avoided and if they occur decontamination should be performed as appropriatei assay selection immunoassays have been developed for rapid detection of sars-cov-2 antigens or antibodies these rapid point-of-care immunoassays are generally lateral flow assays but high-throughput immunoanalyzer versions are also in development for population-level screening such lateral flow assays have been developed for detecting antigens such as the sars-cov-2 virus or for detecting antibodies igm and igg against covid-19rapid antigen lateral flow assays would theoretically provide the advantage of a fast time to result and low-cost detection of sars-cov-2 but are likely to suffer from poor sensitivity early in infection based on the experience with this method for influenza flu viruses 4044 monoclonal antibodies specifically against sars-cov-2 have been under development and several rapid antigen assays are being developed 45 there is concern that given the variability of viral loads in covid-19 patients antigen detection may miss cases due to low infectious burden or sampling variabilityserology measures the host response to infection and is an indirect measure of infection that is best utilized retrospectively serological methods are rapidly being developed and have proven to be useful in confirming past covid-19 25 serology previously has had an important role in the epidemiology of sars 46 and other coronavirus outbreaks 47 rapid lateral flow assays for both igm and igg antibodies undoubtably will play an important role in the covid-19 outbreak and should allow the burden of infection the role of asymptomatic infections the basic reproduction number and the overall mortality to be determined however igm responses are notoriously nonspecific and given the weeks required to develop specific igg responses serology detection is not likely to play a role in active case management except to diagnoseconfirm late covid-19 cases or to determine the immunity of health care workers as the outbreak progresses cell culture is not recommended for diagnostic purposesii assay selection for molecular detection of sars-cov-2 random-amplification deep-sequencing methods played a major role in the initial identification of sars-cov-2 4852 deep sequencing molecular methods such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic next-generation sequencing will continue to be needed to determine future mutations of sars-cov-2 but are currently impractical for diagnosing covid-19 most of the molecular diagnostics being developed for the diagnosis of covid-19 involve real-time rt-pcr assays including those from the us centers for disease control and prevention 53 charit institute of virology in berlin germany 7 54 and hong kong university 21 55 other molecular methods are being developed and evaluated worldwide and include loop-mediated isothermal amplification multiplex isothermal amplification followed by microarray detection and crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-based assays 56iii target selection for real-time rt-pcr assays a real-time rt-pcr method is recommended for molecular testing 6 810 a major advantage of real-time rt-pcr assays is that amplification and analysis are done simultaneously in a closed system to minimize false-positive results associated with amplification product contamination there are a number of coronaviruses that cause respiratory and intestinal infections in humans 8 57 among these coronaviruses are a group of sars-like bat coronaviruses including both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 that comprise a unique clade under the subgenus sarbecovirus 57 58 coronaviruses have a number of molecular targets within their positive-sense single-stranded rna genome that can be used for pcr assays 6 7 57 58 these include genes encoding structural proteins including envelope glycoproteins spike s envelope e transmembrane m helicase hel and nucleocapsid n 5759 in addition to the genes that encode structural proteins there are species-specific accessory genes that are required for viral replication these include rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp hemagglutinin-esterase he and open reading frame 1a orf1a and orf1b 7 5355 57 58 in the united states the cdc recommends two nucleocapsid protein targets n1 and n2 53 while who recommends first-line screening with an e gene assay followed by a confirmatory assay using the rdrp gene 7 chan et al have just developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time rt-pcr assays targeting the rdrphel s and n genes of sars-cov-2 among them the covid-19-rdrphel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro and higher sensitivity and specificity 59 however it is likely that well-optimized targets will arise from a number of viral genomic locations since assay performance is usually dictated by the reagent design not the target itself since the viral genes are present in equal copy numbersto avoid potential cross-reaction with other endemic coronaviruses as well as potential genetic drift of sars-cov-2 at least two molecular targets should be included in the assay various investigators in different countries have used a number of these molecular targets for real-time rt-pcr assays in the united states the cdc has selected two loci in the nucleocapsid gene as the two-target assay appears to be performing well 53 one study utilized two sequence regions open reading frame 1b and a nucleocapsid protein that are highly conserved among sarbecoviruses for initial real-time rt-pcr testing 6 another study in hong kong china used two targets for its rt-pcr assay the first used the nucleocapsid for screening followed by confirmation by the open reading frame 1b 55 in germany two molecular targets envelope and rna-dependent rna polymerase have been selected 7 in china at the time of manuscript preparation several molecular devices had received urgent approval 8 to date there has been no indication that any one of the sequence regions used offers a unique advantage for clinical diagnostic testing however the ideal design would include at least one conserved region and one specific region to mitigate against the effects of genetic drift especially as the virus evolves within new populationsin the united states regulatory issues have complicated the development and implementation of laboratory-developed molecular tests for the diagnosis of covid-19 on 29 february 2020 the fda issued new guidance for laboratories to be able to develop and implement covid-19 molecular diagnostic tests prior to obtaining eua laboratories are required to submit an eau to the fda within 15 business days after validation moreover the validation must include the specimen types eg nasopharyngeal oropharyngeal or saliva that are to be used clinically although these new regulatory burdens did not prohibit the development of molecular laboratory testing for the diagnosis of covid-19 they did create a lot of extra work at the time of writing the us fda had granted quite a few euas httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesemergency-use-authorizationscoronavirus2019 accessed 28 march 2020i interpretation of molecular results in the united states initially if both of two targets in the cdc assay nucleocapsid proteins n1 and n2 test positive a case is considered to be laboratory confirmed 53 a cycle threshold ct value of less than 40 is defined as a positive test while a ct value of 40 or more is defined as a negative test a ct value of 40 for only one of the two nucleocapsid protein n1 and n2 is defined as indeterminant and requires confirmation by retesting 53 currently in china for the assays with three targets positives for two or more targets are considered positive 60 although some correlations have been revealed viral loads determined by real-time rt-pcr assays should not be used yet to indicate covid-19 severity or to monitor therapeutic response 1113 61 62 however low ct values indicating high viral loads may be used as an indication of transmissibility 18 63ii test of cure and test of infectivity monitoring patients with resolution of covid-19 pneumonia may also be important in terms of when they should be released from isolation and discharged if discharged patients are still shedding viable coronavirus they are likely to infect other people 27 therefore self-quarantine for up to 1 month has been recommended in some cases np and op swabs may not be sufficient for either test of cure or test of infectivity 64 but this needs further investigation one approach to test of cure has been to demonstrate two consecutive negative real-time rt-pcr tests from rectal swabs this suggestion is based on the fact that sars-cov-1 was cultured from stool during the 2002-2003 sars outbreak 26 28 31 and sars-cov-2 has been cultured from stool during the covid-19 outbreak 16 thus a rectal swab that is positive by real-time pcr testing suggests that this patient may be shedding viable sars-cov-2 in their stools thereby remaining infectious 16 2428 3032 however a very recent study on 20 serial covid-19 patients indicated that infectious virus was not isolated from stool samples in spite of high virus rna concentrations 14 the correlation of rt-pcr positivity in stool with recovery of live virus from the same samples remains to be fully investigatediii serology of covid-19 members of the coronavirus family have four structural proteins the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins two of these proteins appear to be important antigenic sites for the development of serological assays to detect covid-19 serological methods have focused on detecting serum antibodies against s proteins from the coronavirus spike 47 the coronavirus envelope spike is responsible for receptor binding and fusion and determines host tropism and transmission capability 57 58 s proteins are determined by the s gene and are functionally divided into two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 domain is responsible for receptor binding while the s2 domain is responsible for fusion sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is found on human respiratory cells renal cells and gastrointestinal cells 57 65 66 the other protein that appears to be an important antigenic site for the development of serological assays to detect covid-19 is the n protein which is a structural component of the helical nucleocapsid the n protein plays an important role in viral pathogenesis replication and rna packaging antibodies to the n protein are frequently detected in covid-19 patients 67 68 suggesting that the n protein may be one of the immunodominant antigens in the early diagnosis of covid-19 69as mentioned above rapid lateral flow assays for antibodies igm and igg produced during covid-19 have been developed 70 seroconversion occurred after 7 days of symptomatic infection in 50 of patients 14 days in all but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load 14 serological methods when available will play an important role in the epidemiology of covid-19 and in determining the immune status of asymptomatic patients but are unlikely to play any role in screening or for the diagnosis of early infections 14 67 68 however serology may be useful for confirming the diagnosis of covid-19 25the ongoing unprecedented outbreak of covid-19 globally has emphasized the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of human coronavirus infections in order to limit the spread as well as to appropriately treat those patients who have a serious infection this commentary has addressed current issues regarding such testing for sars-cov-2 for example an np rather than op swab is recommended for early diagnosis or screening because it provides higher diagnostic yields is better tolerated by the patient and is safer for the operator an np swab can be combined with an op swab to increase sensitivity but requires twice the number of swabs should the np swabs become scarce self-collected saliva or nasal washes could be used as an alternative specimen type for epidemiological screening and for the worried well who are asymptomatic persons with no exposure history who wish to be tested just to be sure they are not infected np swabs would then be reserved for hospitalized patients those who test negative may need deep sputum or bal fluid samples collected the importance of repeated testing or the use of bronchoscopy in patients with severe illness should the first screening test be negative must be understood the role of rectal swabs in testing patients with late infection or as a test of infectivitycure is currently not well studied but needs urgent attention equally unappreciated is the need for broad screeningtesting with molecular testing andor serological testing in order to determine the true mortality rate as well as other epidemiological markers finally the importance of rapid development of integrated random-access point-of-care molecular devices for the accurate diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infections cannot be overemphasized these short-turnaround-time stat tests will be very important for real-time patient management and infection control decisions especially when other less infectious forms of pneumonia are present and respiratory isolate resources are scarce these assays are safe simple and fast and can be used in local clinics and hospitals that already have the needed instruments and that are responsible for identifying and treating such patientsmiddle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a novel beta coronavirus that may cause lethal respiratory disease 1 anti-mers-cov serologic tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and immunofluorescence assay ifa are available as commercial kits and have been used for various purposes including epidemiologic investigations evaluation of antibody kinetics and assessing feasibility of convalescent plasma infusion therapy 26 the manufacturers instructions provided relatively high cut-off values for positivity to warrant specificity which were derived from limited positive samples elisa igg euroimmun lbeck germany 4 mers patient samples and 500 negative controls 7 in previously conducted serologic studies cut-off values were differently applied depending on the purpose of serologic tests several epidemiologic studies applied low cut-off values to increase sensitivity of the test 3 6 while others followed the manufacturers instructions 2 4 also as not all confirmed mers-cov-infected patients mounted robust neutralization activity 2 the performance of serologic tests should be separately analyzed depending on the purposes of the tests predicting neutralization activity in mers-cov-infected patients and diagnosing mers-cov infection in epidemiologic surveillance to provide optimal cut-off values depending on the purposes of the tests we evaluated performance of various anti-mers-cov serologic tests using 138 serum samples of 49 mers-cov-infected patients and 219 serum samples of 219 rrt-pcr-negative mers-cov-exposed healthcare personnel hcp and patientsthe performance analysis included sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value and was conducted under two different purposes of serologic tests 1 prediction of neutralization activity in mers-cov-infected patients and 2 epidemiologic surveillance of mers-cov infections among mers-cov-exposed individuals plaque reduction neutralization test prnt and sputum real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr for mers-cov were used as gold standards for assessing neutralization activity and diagnosing mers-cov infection respectivelymers-cov exposure dates and symptom onsets of collected serum samples were clearly identified owing to thorough contact investigation and monitoring of exposed individuals 8 to provide a common point of reference we used days post onset of illness dpoi assessing neutralization activity since symptom onset could be clearly identified among mers-cov-infected patients meanwhile as epidemiologic surveillances are usually conducted on the basis of exposure events we applied days post exposure dpex assessing diagnostic performance of serologic tests in epidemiologic surveillanceto compare performances of serologic tests depending on serum collection time each test was evaluated at three different timepoints 1 regardless of serum collection time 2 after 14 dpoi or 21 dpex and 3 after 21 dpoi or 28 dpexduring the 2015 korean mers outbreak we obtained 138 serum samples from 49 mers-cov infected patients study population included 42 patients who were managed at a 1950-bed tertiary care university hospital 8 9 and seven patients who donated sera for plasma infusion therapy or serologic testing mers-cov infections were confirmed on the basis of rrt-pcr assays targeting upstream of the e gene upe and the open-reading frame gene 1a orf1a 10 11 epidemiologic investigation data and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain exact exposure date and symptom onset one or two serum samples were collected per week of illness during hospitalization follow-up serum samples were obtained up to 6 months from symptom onset at an outpatient clinic sera of 219 rrt-pcr-negative mers-cov-exposed hcp and patients were used as negative control samples 3 collected samples were stored at 70 c for about three months before testing the institutional review board of samsung medical

neutralization testing is a gold standard method for detecting antiviral antibodies especially exhibiting virus-killing function however neutralization tests against mers-cov cannot be readily performed worldwide as it requires biosafety level 3 facilities skilled experts and carries a potential risk of infection 5 to reduce such risks and workloads previous anti-mers-cov serologic studies applied step-wise approaches using elisa and ifa which are relatively easy and safe to test 6 12 to make anti-mers-cov serologic tests more practical we assessed performance of elisa and ifa tests for two clinical purposes and suggested optimal cut-off valuesas previous cut-off values for positivity were provided for diagnosis of mers-cov infection 7 we firstly suggest cut-off values for predicting neutralization activity in the present analysis both elisa igg and iga excellently predicted neutralization activity using sera collected after 21 dpoi auc 1000 and 0996 respectively of note elisa igg showed 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity at this time point with od ratio cut-off value of 04 predicting neutralization activity is extremely important in selecting donors and recipients of convalescent plasma infusion therapy which is a potential treatment for mers-cov infection 2 in the present analysis even after 21 dpoi 195 841 supplementary table 1 of collected sera did not have neutralization activity which emphasizes importance of antibody testing before collecting convalescent plasma in addition measurement of neutralization activity is also important in selecting recipients and evaluating effect of convalescent plasma infusion using elsia tests with performance data from the present analysis evaluation of neutralization activity can be performed in the field of mers patient management without delaydiagnosing mers-cov infections using anti-mers-cov serologic tests has been practically used for post-exposure epidemiologic studies or sero-prevalence investigations in endemic regions 3 6 12 16 to increase sensitivity of elisa as a screening test several epidemiologic studies applied low cut-off values of od ratio usually a three-fold value of negative controls elisa igg od ratios 02 to 03 depending on study sites 3 6 in the present analysis we demonstrated that an elisa igg cut-off value of od ratio 02 actually showed optimal performance with high specificity of 92 to 94 this is visually well demonstrated in fig 2 an elisa igg cut-off value of od ratio 02 optimally discriminated negative controls and symptomatic infections groups 1 to 3 while elisa iga and ifa igm show inferior performance differentiating negative controls and mild patients group 1 asymptomatic patients group 0 did not show any serologic responses which make serologic diagnosis inapplicable the manufacturers instructions provided a significantly higher break point for mers diagnosis to warrant specificity for elisa igg borderline od ratio cut-off of 0811 and positive 11 7 however we demonstrated that elisa igg exhibits 100 specificity from the cut-off value of od ratio 05 supplementary table 5 while previous cut-off value of od ratio 11 showed extremely low sensitivity of 348 therefore we suggest elisa igg od ratio 02 as a new break point for mers-cov diagnosis for general application while od ratio 05 can be applied for maximal specificity in addition we recommend taking at least a 28-day interval from mers-exposure to serum sampling for post-exposure serologic investigations to warrant seroconversion in our unpublished data seroconversion occurred around the third week of illness or the fourth week after exposure 18 dpoi in median ranged 1424 22 dpex in median ranged 1830 ko et al data under reviewalthough elisa igg showed slightly higher auc than ifa igg supplementary table 4 the number of ifa tested samples was not sufficient which limited comparison of performance between the two different methods however performance of elisa igg was at least not inferior to that of ifa igg which implies that additional confirmation by ifa after elisa screening is not mandatory in addition considering the cross-reactivity of the serologic tests to other coronaviruses 12 the performance for mers diagnosis could be affected by the local epidemiology of human coronavirus infectionsin conclusion in a performance analysis using 138 serum samples form 49 mers-cov-infected patients elisa igg showed optimal performance in predicting neutralization activity and diagnosing mers-cov infection at cut-off values of od ratio 04 and 02 respectively with this performance analysis anti-mers-cov serologic tests can be practically used in the field of mers managementwe searched the medline ovid database for articles on sars-cov-2 serologic assays the appendix available at annalsorg shows the search strategy additional studies were identified by hand-searching references of selected articles consulting international experts and searching covid-19 and sars-cov-2 preprints on medrxiv and biorxiv this search was last updated on 20 may 2020whereas the utility of antibody detection tests for the diagnosis of active covid-19 is limited 8 serologic assays are crucial for documenting prior infection and the presence of antibodies which may indicate immunity table 110 shows potential use cases for sars-cov-2 antibody testingthe interpretation of the results of antibody testing for sars-cov-2 figure can present challenges owing to uncertainty about 1 whether mild and asymptomatic cases mount a detectable humoral immune response 2 whether the detection of antibodies correlates with protective immunity 3 the duration of antibody response and anamnestic responses after infection and 4 the relative importance of the humoral cellular and innate responses of note infection prevalence in the population being tested must always be considered in patients with clinical features of covid-19 a highly specific test such as sars-cov-2 polymerase chain reaction pcr has a high positive predictive value for true infection conversely if testing asymptomatic individuals when the true seroprevalence of a population is only 5 an assay with a specificity of 95 would produce a false-positive rate of 50 low specificity is particularly problematic
in cases where incorrectly identifying an individual as immune could place them at significant riskfor instance if they were to enter settings with high risk for exposure without appropriate personal protective equipmentthe sensitivity of a serologic assay can be established by testing sera from patients who have been identified as infected on the basis of a reference standard however a single estimate of sensitivity to describe test performance can be difficult to interpret when samples are collected at different time points since infection sensitivity estimates will vary according to time since infection in the validation cohort early 7 days since symptom onset and mid-stage 8 to 14 days pcr-confirmed cases of covid-19 will have lower rates of seroconversion than in the later stage 14 days thus antibody tests will have lower sensitivity to detect infection in earlier phases likewise antibody responses may be more easily detectable in severe cases hospitalized patients than in mild or asymptomatic infections 11establishing the analytic specificity of sars-cov-2 seroassays presents a challenge because of potential for cross-reactivity with antibodies to related coronaviruses 11 12 to address this test reactivity thresholds used to define a positive result can be adjusted to optimize the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity 13 with higher thresholds sensitivity decreases as cases with low serum antibody levels are categorized as negative but specificity improves as low amounts of nonspecific antibody are no longer considered positive physicochemical assay variables can also be modified so that less specific antibodies with less avidity for the antigen are excluded this also improves specificity at some expense to sensitivity tests that target igm which by its nature can be nonspecific will probably have
increased risk for false-positive resultsvalidation of the clinical specificity of a serologic assay requires sera from different types of sources in the case of covid-19 sera collected before the end of 2019 are presumed to be seronegative for sars-cov-2 14 the samples chosen should be representative of the population of interest in addition individuals known to have been infected with various common pathogens including other human coronaviruses but who could not have been infected with sars-cov-2 should be evaluated to demonstrate the absence of cross-reactivity finally patients with illnesses known to stimulate high levels of polyclonal antibodies such as epsteinbarr virus infection malaria or conditions associated with production of rheumatoid factor can be evaluated for cross-reactivity 1517 without these validations assay specificity will be difficult to establish
once a particular assay is shown to have high sensitivity and high specificity this assay can serve as a surrogate gold standard for the validation of other assays as well as a standard for quantitative assaysto date most published sars-cov-2 serologic assay validations have classified patient sera according to sars-cov-2 pcr results 18 polymerase chain reaction assay is an imperfect comparator for sars-cov-2 diagnosis because of variable analytic performance across assays 19 and because pcr sensitivity depends on sample type quality of sampling and timing relative to illness onset 4 20 this can lead to unpredictable directions of bias for seroassay accuracy estimates there is an urgent need for validation studies to provide more detail on pcr comparators and on study populations especially regarding disease severity and timing in the illness course furthermore to enable a better understanding of the diagnostic accuracy of various sars-cov-2 serologic tests the development of reference
panels including seroconversion panels by using well-characterized sera is necessaryonly a subset of antibodies raised against a specific antigen have the property of neutralizing viral replication neutralization assays such as plaque reduction and microneutralization methods provide essential data for the validation of candidate diagnostic tests and to define correlates of protective immunity the primary drawback of functional assays of sars-cov-2 neutralization is that they can only be performed by experienced staff in a biosafety level bsl 3 laboratory owing to the need to culture live virus which increases complexity and cost thus efforts to circumvent these obstacles have converged on finding surrogates of traditional neutralization titers live pseudotyped viruses have been developed that incorporate the s protein of sars-cov-2 can be cultivated in bsl-2 conditions and express a reporter enzyme when infecting cells through binding to the ace2 receptor thereby allowing for automated quantification 27 such reporter virus systems would offer substantial advantages in terms of speed cost and scalability while providing a quasi-functional assessment of the host neutralizing antibody response 18 other groups are striving to create surrogates of neutralization that bypass the need for viral culture through the use of blocking elisa formats 28for high-throughput and inexpensive after initial capital outlay screening in clinical laboratories relevant antigenic targets can be purified or synthesized and 1 or more can be incorporated into an elisa test platform specific antibodyantigen reactivity is detected by using enzyme conjugates that produce color changes or other detector labels that can be objectively measured 29 the elisas detect antibodies directed at the chosen antigen without regard for their ability to elicit viral neutralization thus interpretation of immune status from elisa results requires rigorous characterization of the assay with respect to a reference standard for the moment this work has not been done for sars-cov-2 furthermore universal standards for reporting are lacking some assays produce semiquantitative results others are qualitative and assays have variable test detection limits and reproducibility and use
different analytes igg igm iga or combinations thereof with unclear effect on performance 30 it is thus not surprising that estimates of elisa test sensitivity and specificity vary widely across assays and even within assays evaluated by different investigators table 23147the lfas leverage the same capture agents as an elisa in a lateral flow strip format 48 the lateral flow format enables a simple and fast time to result 10 to 30 minutes but with tradeoffs in detection that is several-fold less sensitive than their elisa counterpart a higher cost per test and lower throughput 49 for lfas follow-up confirmatory testing is typically recommended most provide qualitative visual results subjectively interpreted by the operator the use of a small instrument reader can increase test sensitivity and may permit quantitative and more reproducible results 50 51 to enable community-based and home testing lfas should be paired with minimally invasive samples such as finger-prick or oral fluid or swabs and minimal sample processingthese tests are ideal for near-patient testing and low infrastructure settings such as the lower levels of the public health system in low- and middle-income countries 52 where they have been used to effectively screen and triage cases of epidemic and nonepidemic diseases particularly where resources are constrained inexpensive lfas may be useful to expand diagnostic test capacity many sars-cov-2 lfa antibody tests are available however the performance of these tests is still under evaluation and their value needs to be carefully weighed depending on the use case a recent large study found heterogeneous and inconsistent results among 10 lfas and identified signal interpretation as a major obstacle 41population-based seroepidemiologic studies are an important source of evidence about sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics and will be critical for informing interventions to mitigate the effects of the covid-19 pandemic 53 whereas reports of clinical cases identify persons with acute disease seroepidemiologic studies identify those who were infected previously including those who experienced mild disease or subclinical infections and thus may not be subject to biases due to health careseeking behavior and limitations on eligibility for testing during acute disease these assessments of seroprevalence overall and in specific groups can be used to estimate important characteristics of the pandemic 5456 serologic surveillance studies can also assess the accumulation of persons with antibody responses over time to estimate incidence of sars-cov-2
infection 57 58 and can track age- and jurisdiction-specific disease susceptibility and identify at-risk populations 59 utilizing standard protocols for the design and implementation of serologic studies 60 and making protocols publicly available can improve scientific rigor and ensure comparability across studies undertaken in different populations of note the who unity studies aim to combine worldwide seroepidemiologic study data 61cross-sectional serologic surveillance studies are a key first step toward determining the proportion of a population that has been infected with sars-cov-2 when estimating age-specific seroprevalence is the primary aim the gold-standard study design is the conduct of appropriately powered cross-sectional age-stratified population-representative randomly sampled serologic studies in each population of interest this study design when implemented appropriately ensures that the estimates obtained are representative of the population of interest and minimizes the potential that the results may have common sources of bias 62 in addition many variations of this design are also valuable for estimating age-specific seroprevalence especially when statistical methods are used that can account for alternative design elements and sources of uncertainty 63 layering seroprevalence
surveys onto other existing observational or interventional studies or utilizing residual sera from blood donors or from routine lab tests can increase feasibility and timeliness of estimating seroprevalence at some risk to generalizabilityto determine sars-cov-2 seroincidence or the proportion of the population seroconverting over a certain time frame longitudinal studies can be conducted among cohorts of individuals who are at high risk for exposure such as health care workers or among those for whom little is known about the risk for infection such as children furthermore longitudinal serologic surveillance can be implemented to provide insight in situations where prevention and control measures are changing over time and to evaluate the impact of such measures on the incidence of infection studies on the dynamics of humoral responses over time also require longitudinal evaluationnumerous other seroepidemiologic study designs can fill in gaps in our knowledge about sars-cov-2 for instance household- or workplace-based serologic studies can aid in the determination of secondary attack rates especially when the proportion of asymptomatic infections may be high in addition well-designed seroepidemiologic studies are critical for informing mathematical models and forecasting tools to guide prevention and control strategiesa critical aspect in the interpretation of serologic tests is an understanding of the dynamic nature of the humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection a few studies have defined the kinetics of antibody formation in patients with disease ranging from mildly symptomatic to critically ill these studies have consistently shown that most patients seroconvert by 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and almost all patients have detectable antibodies by day 28 6 7 20 64 65 antibodies can be detected as early as 1 day after illness onset with peak igm and iga titers occurring in the ensuing 7 to 14 days and waning thereafter the igg response appears to peak simultaneously in some cases or slightly later in others 66 and plateaus between 15 and 21 days 6 in some cases igg titer declines significantly within weeks 67 some patients appear to have weak or undetectable seroconversion 44 66 illness severity probably affects antibody responses critically ill patients had a delayed but more robust formation of igm and igg in one study 7 antisars-cov-2 responses in subclinical infections have yet to be characterized finally the suitability of alternative specimen types to serum such as saliva or dried blood spots 68 69 must be established for sars-cov-2 serodiagnosticscorrelates of protection are empirically derived specific immune markers associated with protection against infection or disease 53 seropositivity is often a useful correlate for clinical immunity though cell-mediated immunity is known to be essential and antibody production is not the sole mechanistic contribution to protection 70 the relationship between seropositivity and immune protection has not yet been established for coronavirusesa recent report on 175 patients who recovered from covid-19 showed that nab titers were moderately correlated with antibodies binding to s protein domains 24 surprisingly 30 of patients developed only low titers of nabs after recovery with younger patients 15 to 39 years of age having significantly lower antisars-cov-2 and nab titers this suggest that innate and adaptive cellular immunity are also likely to play a significant role in viral clearance and immunity to coronaviruses 71little is known regarding seropositivity and risk for reinfection to coronaviruses in a challenge study with hcov-229e healthy volunteers who had lower specific igg titers at baseline were more likely to develop clinically overt infection 72 after the challenge specific igg and nab peaked at 3 weeks and fell considerably at 12 weeks one year later 6 out of 9 previously infected participants became infected after a rechallenge though they were asymptomatic and the duration of viral shedding was shorter than during the first challengesuggesting at least partial protection induced by the first infection of note the immune response dynamics after sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov infection differ substantially from what was seen with hcov-229e challenge values for igg and nab peaked 4 months after sars-cov-1 and decreased after 16 months after mers-cov infection 86 of
patients had detectable igg and nabs for at least 34 months 11evaluations of sars-cov-2 serologic assays must account for potential cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses including the 4 endemic human coronaviruses hku1 oc43 nl63 and 229e a systematic review of antibody-mediated immunity to coronaviruses found that studies of serologic responses to human coronavirus n proteins suggest cross-reactivity within human alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 and human betacoronaviruses oc43 and hku1 but not between human alpha- and betacoronaviruses 11 the available evidence suggests that natural infections with endemic coronaviruses produce little cross-reactivity to emerging coronaviruses sars-cov-1 and mers-covregarding sars-cov-2 elisa using s1 protein epitopes several pilot studies report positive results with sera from patients with sars-cov-1 and a lack of significant cross-reactivity when using sera from small numbers of patients seropositive for the endemic human coronaviruses 18 44 data regarding sars-cov-2 elisa based on the n protein are more limited the specificity of 2 elisa and 10 lateral flow assays has also been assessed against 108 precovid-19 sera from us patients collected in july 2018 and ranged from 843 to 100 41 finally in keeping with these results a surrogate assay of sars-cov-2 viral neutralization tests was found to be highly specific among sera positive for endemic human coronaviruses antibodies but showed some degree of cross reactivity with sars-cov-1 positive sera 28 thus cross reactivity of sars-cov-2 serologic assays may be a concern in areas where sars-cov-1 and mers-cov circulated widely overall serologic tests based on s protein appear to distinguish between emerging and endemic coronaviruses assays based on the n protein can serve as a marker of recent infection but might be expected to cross react more with endemic coronavirusesconvalescent plasma therapy as a means of providing passive immunity to susceptible individuals and as early therapy after infection has been used for many viral infections 73 this approach was used in a small number of patients with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov and has shown promise in a few case series of sars-cov-2 infection 7477 use of covid-19 convalescent plasma has been approved in several jurisdictions under the category of an emergency investigational new drug 78as a general principle the efficacy of plasma therapy is a function of several factors including timing of plasma donation plasma obtained a few weeks after recovery during convalescence is considered more immunogenic with higher titers of polyclonal neutralizing antibodies dosage and timing of administration in relation to onset of disease in the recipient for covid-19 identifying optimal donors will prove to be an additional challenge given the heterogeneity in antibody titers during convalescence and the lack of an established correlation between specific antibody titers and clinical efficacy 79 as an example in the treatment of influenza plasma with high nab titers collected from a nonconvalescent general population did not show efficacy 80 81 suggesting that donor selection should not be based solely
on serologic titers eventually antibody derived from vaccinated donors may deserve further studyserologic tests are essential to better understand the determinants of sars-cov-2 immunity and to guide vaccine development for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the s protein was shown to be the most important antigen leading to production of nabs and inhibition of viral entry into the host cells 82 since then s protein has been the major target for vaccine candidates previous experience using sars-cov-1 subunit vaccine based on the full-length s protein showed potent nab responses and protective immunity in animal models however some of these vaccines were also associated with a harmful immune enhancement as seen in vaccine candidates for dengue or respiratory syncytial virus leading to a potentially more severe disease in vaccinated individuals 83 antibody-dependent enhancement has also been seen among sars-cov-1infected macaques injected with antispike igg 84 for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein was shown to be the major immunodominant region subunit vaccines targeting rbd specifically elicited high nab titers but were not associated with immune enhancement 82 85in sars-cov-2infected patients among the binding antibodies to the different regions of the s protein s1 s2 rbd rbd-specific igg correlated best with nabs suggesting that rbd is be a promising target for sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates 24 however because rbd is the most variable region of the genome 86 there is still a theoretical risk for immunologic escape as well as immune enhancement development 87 the n protein a more conserved region of the genome has been of interest for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccine candidates and was thought to be at lower risk for immune enhancement however it was not shown to elicit nabs 82 the role of the n protein in sars-cov-2 immune response is still unknownin conclusion the covid-19 pandemic has revealed several gaps in our diagnostic arsenal and is highlighting the essential role of serodiagnostics as part of our public health response with the use of carefully validated assays appropriately designed serologic studies will help characterize transmission dynamics and refine disease burden estimates urgent scientific research is needed to link specific serologic variables with immunity against sars-cov-2the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is the latest pandemic gaoling the humanity having very high spreading rate and approximately 56 of mortality worldwide this novel beta coronavirus is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense rna virus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 genome structure comprises single stranded rna with nucleocapsid protein which are enclosed by membrane proteins envelope proteins and spike glycoproteins 1 fig 1 as a coronavirus the sars-cov-2 has high similarity with other viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov 2 the entry of the novel coronavirus to host is through the interaction between the densely glycosylated spike proteins to the receptors on host cell membrane the spike glycoprotein is a trimeric class i fusion protein consisting s1 and s2 domains 3 it is reported that there is 55 similarity in s1 domain of spike glycoproteins among sars-cov-2 and sars-cov and 91 similarity in case of s2 domain it is evident that the sars-cov-2 can infect the human respiratory epithelial cells through interaction of spike protein with the human ace2 receptor 4the coronaviruses are large rna viruses 65125 nm in diameter come under the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order normally the coronavirus genome contains six open reading frame orfs which encodes for the structural as well as accessory proteins in the virus the nucleocapsid protein n-protein in the coronavirus binds to rna genome and forms a capsid around the enclosed nucleic acid the function of n-protein includes the interaction with membrane protein during viral assembly assists in rna synthesisfolding and affects host cell responses including cell cycle and translation the structural and accessory proteins are essential for viral replication genome maintenance and pathogenesis of the virus 5 at present the most widely used approved test for the diagnosis of covid-19 is the polymerase chain reaction pcr two different strategies are in use for pcr based assays the reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr and the loop mediated isothermal amplification pcr lamp pcr both methods offer high sensitivity 8590 and specificity for the covid-19 diagnosis as the methods are focusing on direct amplification of the virus genetic material the rt-pcr is quantitative in nature whereas the lamp pcr is qualitative as compared to rt-pcr lamp pcr will be more cost effective and less time consuming high throughput screening is another nucleic acid detection technology it is costly and has high equipment dependency making it less widely used even though the aforementioned methods can offer nearly 90 accurate result the improper sample collection handling and transportation may lead to false negative results obviously decreasing the sensitivity of the assaythe rt-pcr is the most common and effective method used in the market to detect sars-cov-2 in rt-pcr reverse transcriptase converts virus rna into cdna following amplification into millions of copies of dna using a set of specific primers and probes the amplification taking place in 3 steps 1 denaturation 2 annealing and 3 elongation these three steps take place at 95 c for 30 s 50 for 30 s and 72 c for 60 s respectively the primers target and amplify different regions for sars-cov-2 such as nucleocapsid protein n gene envelope protein e gene and orf1ab gene regions which can be determined within the same cycle and separately for confirmatory testing 6 the turnaround time for sample analyses is 2535 h one-step rt-pcr assay to detect e gene and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene regions of sars-cov-2 has been developed by tib-molbiol 7 predominantly upper respiratory samples including nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs are recommended for analysis there are many breakthrough assays developed by various ivd manufacturers including abbott bosch and cepheid where a specific gene of sars-cov-2 is detected within few minutes although rt-pcr is the most widely used confirmatory test for covid-19 this technique is not robust and can only be performed by skilled analysts due to various biological safety hazards making sample detection cumbersome in many cases 8even though the rt-pcr is a robust technology there are many factors contributing to false-positive and false-negative results mutations in primers targeting virus genome can lead to false negative results laboratory practices and safety procedures including collection transportation and handling also contribute to false negative results 9 the sampling timing and optimum sample types play significant role in obtaining highly sensitive and highly specific results 10 in most pcr assays two different regions of genes are targeted hence the result interpretation will be positive negative or inconclusive if both genes are amplified the result is positive if only one gene is positive that is called inconclusive and negative could be a false negative so inconclusive and negative persons should be treated as doubtfulthe efforts on minimizing length of the entire pcr process and practice of isothermal amplification has resulted in the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification the lamp is a highly specific isothermal amplification technique with an analytical limit of detection of 75 copies per l in lamp conversion of rna to dna is followed by amplification of sample genome using 46 primers forward inner primer forward outer primer reverse inner primer and reverse outer primer targeting different regions of the dna 11 the lamp has several advantages over rt-pcr it is considered to be more user friendly with easy detection speed and less background signal when compared to rt-pcr in addition to its speed lamp shows high level of specificity and high amplification efficiency than rt-pcr 12 the recently developed chitra gene lamp-n by sree chitra thirunal medical institute and technology in collaboration with agappe diagnostics ltd detects two different regions of n gene the turnaround time of 20 min for the analysis of 30 samples is a remarkable achievement however stringent evaluations on commercial lamp kits are needed for accuracy check and processing of large samples is an impetus for covid-19 testingapart from rt-pcr and lamp united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc approved one-step real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr to quantitatively detect viral particles in more than 90 samples within 45 min 13 recently specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking sherlock that allows multiplexed portable and ultra-sensitive detection of rna is a detection strategy used to combat sars-cov-2 cas13a ribonucleases used for rna sensing binds to amplified rna which when activated cleaves fluorophore-quencher probes emitting fluorescence sherlock has previously been used to detect clinical samples for zika virus 14 nevertheless there is a need for further optimisation of this technique in larger samples to achieve large scale evaluation of sars-cov-2though the rrt-pcr is considered as the gold standard in the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 it has own limitations as a pandemic screening and isolation of the infected patients is the only way to reduce the spread of covid-19 in rt-pcr the testing directly look for the presence of viral dna but serological tests detect the presence of antibodiesantigens in human blood against the covid-19 hence rt-pcr will give the positive results in 37 days of infection but serological test will take 714 days to give positive results the test cost and testing time of pcr based assays inevitably demands the development of rapid serology tests 1517 several immunoassays are developed by various ivd companies for detecting covid-19 infection in serum plasma and whole blood among these strategies lateral flow immunoassays elisa and chemiluminescence are most promising approachesthe limitation of rrt-pcr to detect covid-19 past infection and the progress of the disease increases the importance of serological assays the serological tests can detect both active and past infections if the tests are performed within the correct time frame after the onset of the disease in case of antibody detection assay both igg and igm antibodies against the covid-19 are the target analytes where igm appears in blood within a week of time and igg expression will take more than 10 days apart from antibody detection antigen detection against spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein is also under development which offers early detection of covid-19 infection in case of rt-pcr one of the important reasons for false negative results is improper sampling throat swab and transport whereas the sample of choice for serological test is serumplasmawhole blood which are easy to handle and transport serological tests like lfia for antigenantibody detection can be used as a rapid test or a point of care testing which offers quick screening of the patients with limited expertise 18 detecting antibody titre is important for convalescent plasma therapy and the development of vaccines for covid-19 apart from that serological testing would also provide valuable information regarding the course and degree of immune response as well as the durability of immunity in both infected individuals and participants in the vaccine clinical trials 19the lfia can be utilized as a preliminary testing tool for covid-19 in case of community spread or in mass population screening at present the covid-19 iggigm antibody evaluation kits based on lfia is widely available in market upon covid-19 infection the igm and igg antibodies will start to develop in our body from 710 days and 1420 days respectively though igm can be detected earlier it also decreases and disappears earlier but igg can persist for a long time after the infection even though the antibody test kits are reliable for preliminary screening the test cannot be used as a confirmatory test because of non-specific interaction of antibodies and other proteins in the blood with capture and detector molecules in the membrane which may results in false positive or false negative results 20the main advantages of lfia are that it can be used as a rapid poc test and it can be detected using finger-pricked blood or serumplasma it does not require any instruments or expertise staff for carrying out the test and it gives result in 530 min 21 the lfia antibody test for covid-19 can also be considered as a prognostic tool there by provides information about the immune status of the patient mostly the lfia results are qualitative but can be made quantitative by the use of customized color readers currently covid-19 antigen lfia test is under development which will offer more sensitive and specific result for covid-19 diagnosis and will detect the viral antigen in 3 days of infection 22the elisa and clia platforms are widely using serology techniques for the quantitative detection of specific antigen or antibody in the samples zhang et al have developed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of covid-19 igm and igg antibody from serum sample sars-cov-2 rp3 nucleocapsid protein is adsorbed on the surface of a 96 well plate as capture molecule and anti-igg antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase is used as the detector molecule 23 manual elisa kits for detecting covid-19 have been developed by ivd manufactures like ibl international drg diagnostics gmbh epitope diagnostics and euroimmun for detecting the igg and igm antibodies developed in response to covid-19 infection 24 elisa and clia based covid-19 antigen detection kits are under development by ivd manufacturers worldwideautomated clia method can also detect igg and igm antibody in serum or plasma the advantages of automated clia analyzers compared to rapid lfia tests is the very high throughput of samples and the ability to detect other biomarkers like c- reactive protein simultaneously 22 dz-lite sars-cov-2 clia developed by diazyme usa and maglumi clia developed by snibe china are chemiluminescent analyzers which can detect igg and igm antibodies of covid-19besides the aforementioned specific tests certain routine biochemical and haematological tests show abnormal results in covid 19 patients upon covid-19 infection the level of prothrombin time lactate dehydrogenase ldh d-dimer alanine transaminase alt c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and creatine kinase are elevated 25 there is a marked lymphopenia with depletion of cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes in the early phase of the disease as the disease progress patients show higher levels of interleukin-2 il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factorgcsf interferon gamma-induced protein monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein alpha and tumour necrosis factor- tnf- its also noted that patients in intensive care show significant increase in amylase and d-dimer and in case of non survivors there is a marked elevation in the level of ferritin blood urea neutrophil count and d-dimer and creatinine levels but procalcitonin pct is not elevated in covid 19 so procalcitonin level can be used for the differential diagnosis of covid 19 from bacterial pneumonia 26 27the level of crp starts to rise at the time of mild pneumonia and reaches peak at severe pneumonia the crp is also used as a marker of inflammation and the rise correlates with the level of inflammation regardless of the factors such as age sex and physical condition it is reported that the crp levels are positively correlated with lung lesions in early stage of covid 19 cases and can be used as a key indicator for disease monitoring 28 29the nucleic acid based diagnostics methods and serological assays described above are serving as strong diagnostics tools for the covid-19 diagnosis the assurance of quality of developed diagnostics kits is having prime importance at this scenario even though recently many developments happened in the field of serological diagnosis for covid-19 still there are many concerns regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assays the complexity cost effectiveness and limitations of nucleic acid based diagnostic tools impetus the innovative development of well standardized high sensitive specific and low cost serological assays for covid-19 diagnosisthe 2019 novel coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 originating in wuhan china has become a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates up to 2 of confirmed cases the current case definition for confirmed covid-19 due to sarscov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk however this case definition likely underestimates the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested and testing by pcr of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens is unlikely to be 100 sensitive in detecting subclinical infection widespread testing within the united states is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories therefore the true prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection is currently unknown and the sensitivity of pcr to detect infection is also unknownserology can play an important role in defining both the prevalence of and sensitivity of pcr for sars-cov-2 infection particularly for subclinical infection this point is demonstrated by analogy with influenza virus for which a meta-analysis of available literature measured the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by pcr as approximately 16 while the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by seroconversion was measured as approximately 751 the seroprevalence of common human coronaviruses is known to increase throughout childhood to near 100 by adolescence2 thus any serologic methodology to estimate prevalence of sars-cov-2 needs to identify and rule out cross-reactivity with these common human coronavirus strainsone challenge in applying serology to sars-cov-2 is that the choice of antigen and choice of assay is less well defined for coronavirus than more well studied viruses such as influenza however prior approaches to serologic detection of infection with emerging coronaviruses including sars and mers have focused on the s1 domain of the spike s glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid n protein which are considered the immunodominant antigens for these viruses3 in particular the s1 domain is strain-specific while the n protein shows cross-reactivity across strainsthe assay methodologies used for serologic detection of coronavirus infection include binding and neutralization assays these methodologies have been shown to be well correlated4 however neutralization assays require viral culture which must be performed in high-level biosafety containment units for emerging coronaviruses with high epidemic potential such as sars-cov-2 conversely binding assays such as elisa can be readily performed with widely available reagents and equipment so are field deployable and suitable for point of care testingthe protein microarray methodology has been widely used to simultaneously perform binding assays against hundreds of antigens printed onto a nitrocellulose-coated slide for detection of multiple antibody isotypes5 this methodology was recently demonstrated for simultaneous measurement of igg and iga antibodies against over 250 antigens from diverse strains and subtypes of influenza6 this methodology has previously been applied to detect antibodies against the s1 domains of sars and mers coronaviruses7the blood specimens used in this study were collected for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in an eastern university were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection ari cases using questionnaires and rt-qpcr so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections built environment and immunologic phenotypes8 from among de-identified blood specimens for which future research use authorization was obtained five specimens that showed high igg reactivity against human coronaviruses in the larger study were chosen for validation of the coronavirus antigen microarraythe coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or hek-293 cells see tables 13 these antigens were provided by sino biological inc wayne pa as either catalog products or service products the antigens were printed onto microarrays probed with human sera and analyzed as previously described figure 16910briefly lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 01 mgml in phosphate-buffered saline pbs with 0001 tween-20 t-pbs and then printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides from grace bio labs gbl bend or using an omnigrid 100 microarray printer genemachines the microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1100 in 1x gvs fast blocking buffer fischer scientific overnight at 4c washed with t-tbs buffer 20 mm tris-hcl 150 mm nacl 005 tween-20 in ddh2o adjusted to ph 75 and filtered 3 times for 5 minutes each labeled with secondary antibodies to human igg conjugated to quantum dot fluorophore for 2 hours at room temperature and then washed with t-tbs 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried the slides were imaged using arraycam imager grace bio labs bend or to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysisdescriptive statistics were used to summarize the igg reactivity as measured by mean fluorescence across antigen replicates t-test or f-test were used to test for the mean differences in continuous variables across infection groups all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 351 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austriaoverall the 5 sera tested on the coronavirus antigen microarray all showed high igg seroreactivity to antigens from common human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses with known seasonal circulation versus low igg seroreactivity to antigens from epidemic viruses that were not circulating at time of collection figure 2 specifically 4 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity across the 4 common human coronaviruses while all of the sera showed low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to rsv and parainfluenza viruses while 3 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to adenoviruses for influenza all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to h1n1 and h3n2 influenza a and influenza b strains but low igg seroreactivity to h5n1 and h7n9 influenza a strainswith respect to specific antigens the s1 domain of the spike protein including the receptor-binding domain rbd demonstrates very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses whereas the s2 domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein np show low-level cross-reactivity between these coronavirus subtypes similarly the head domain of influenza hemagglutinin ha1 is not cross-reactive between seasonal and avian influenza strains whereas the stalk domain ha2 is cross-reactive between influenza virus subgroups as seen between h1n1 and h5n1 influenza virusesthis pilot study yields several insights into cross-reactivity of common human coronavirus antibodies for sars-cov-2 antigens the antibodies to the s1 and rbd domains of spike protein are highly subtype-specific consistent with the high variability in these sequences between different human coronaviruses conversely the s2 domain of spike protein and np protein are more cross-reactive consistent with these sequences being highly conserved across coronaviruses sars-cov-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to s2 domain and np protein in most people indicating that these antibodies are likely not protective whereas antibodies to s1 and rbd domains are more likely to be protective this observation favors a vaccination strategy based on s1 or rbd domains of spike protein over a vaccination strategy that also includes s2 domain or np protein in addition s1 and rbd domains are more likely to generate subtype-specific serologic tests for population surveillance studiesin addition a key unexplained finding during the sars-cov-2 epidemic has been the low incidence of infection in children aged 15 and younger this observation generates two related hypotheses adults may have pre-existing antibodies against antigenically distinct coronaviruses that produce an ineffective humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection antibody-dependent enhancement as demonstrated for dengue virus or children younger than 15 may have initially encountered a coronavirus that is more closely related to sars-cov-2 so are more protected against this infection immunologic imprinting or original antigenic sin as demonstrated for influenza virus both of these hypotheses would be informed by comparing the level of cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies in pediatric and adult cohorts and correlating these antibodies with incidence of severe diseasea coronavirus antigen microarray has been constructed with antigens from epidemic coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 and common human coronaviruses in addition to other common respiratory viruses a pilot study of 5 nave human sera shows high igg seroreactivity to common human coronaviruses but low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2 with some cross-reactivity seen for s2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein further studies are needed including with sars-cov-2 convalescent sera to fully realize the potential of this novel methodology to characterize the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 and the impact of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies on the disease coursetransmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the alphacoronavirus 1 species within the genus alphacoronavirus in the family coronaviridae transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a highly contagious virus that causes enteric disease characterized by vomiting severe diarrhea and high mortality in piglets in tgevprcv-naive herds the virus was first described by doyle and hutchings in 1946 in the united states and subsequently reported worldwide 13 porcine respiratory coronavirus is a naturally occurring spike gene deletion 170 to 190 kda mutant of tgev first isolated in belgium in 1984 4 it infects the upper respiratory tract tonsils or lungs with limited intestinal replication 4 5 porcine respiratory coronavirus itself does not appear to be an important primary pathogen with the exception of its contribution to the porcine respiratory disease complex 6tgev and prcv share biological and molecular features but differ in their epidemiology clinical presentation and pathogenesis real-time reverse transcription-pcr rrt-pcr and multiplex microarray hybridization using primers targeting the 5 region of the s gene spanning the deletion region in pcrv strain are commonly used for the diagnosis of tgev and differentiation of tgev and prcv 710 serum antibodies provide serological evidence of tgev or prcv infection but prcv-infected pigs produce antibodies that cross-react and cross-neutralize tgev ie conventional serological tests cannot differentiate between tgev- and prcv-infected animals this presents a complication for tgev seroprevalence studies and serological surveys of sows or slaughterhouse swine tested for international trade 5to address the issue of cross-reactivity monoclonal antibodies targeting antigenic regions of tgev that have been deleted from the prcv s protein 1117 have been used to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas for tgevprcv differential serodiagnosis 1720 several commercial tgevprcv blocking elisas are available but comparative test performances have not been reported in recent publications in this study the diagnostic test performances of three commercial tgevprcv blocking elisa kits were evaluated using serum samples of precisely known porcine coronavirus immune statusmild watery diarrhea was observed in pigs inoculated with tgev miller strain between 2 to 4 days postinoculation dpi no clinical signs were observed in

reported between 7 and 10 dpi in both tgev-inoculated groups strains purdue and miller the number of tgev antibody-positive pigs detected increased through the study regardless of the elisa kit usedfor the tgev purdue inoculation group no significant differences p  005 were found in the percentages of tgev-seropositive pigs reported by the three elisas regardless of the time postinoculation

than those obtained with the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa 14 21 and 35 dpi and ingezim corona diferencial elisa 21 to 35 dpiwith the exception of one false-positive result reported 42 dpi by

purdue-inoculated group fig 3a to c than in the tgev strain miller group fig 3d to f the cross-reactivity appeared more marked at early stages postexposure 7 to 14 dpi no differences were found between elisa kits over the course of the study except at 7 dpi when the proportion of prcv-false-positive animals detected by the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa was significantly greater p  005 than that by the ingezim corona diferencial elisa regardless of the interpretation of suspect resultsthe analytical specificity and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial differential tgevprcv elisa kits evaluated in this study are presented in table 1 diagnostic parameters are presented relative to the interpretation of suspect results as positive or negativeoverall the diagnostic sensitivity for the tgev miller inoculation group was higher than for the tgev purdue group independent of the commercial elisa kit evaluated the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa kit showed the highest diagnostic sensitivity for antibody detection in pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller 94 regardless of the interpretation of suspect results the diagnostic sensitivity for the tgev strain purdue-inoculated group was higher with the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit 79 when suspect results were considered positive while it was slightly higher with the ingezim corona diferencial elisa kit 54 when suspect results were interpreted as negativethe diagnostic sensitivities for prcv antibody detection obtained with both swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa 86 and ingezim corona diferencial elisa 81 to 85 were greater than that of the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit 28 with the exception of the ingezim corona diferencial elisa the diagnostic sensitivity calculated for each elisa kit was not affected by the interpretation of suspect results positive versus negativethe three commercial elisas showed 100 diagnostic specificity for both tgev and prcv detection with the exception for one prcv-false-positive result reported by the ingezim corona diferencial elisa which resulted in a diagnostic specificity of 992 for prcv detection the diagnostic specificity of any of the evaluated elisa kits was unaffected by the interpretation of suspect resultsthe ingezim corona diferencial elisa kit showed the highest analytical specificity less cross-reactivity for tgev-specific antibody detection 823 for all three commercial elisas we found higher cross-reactivity to prcv within the tgev purdue inoculation group than in the tgev miller group the highest analytical specificity for prcv was obtained with the ingezim corona diferencial elisa 84 when suspect results were interpreted as positive or with the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit 95 when suspect results were interpreted as negative however the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit showed the lowest analytical specificity 39 of the kits when suspect results were interpreted as positivethe greatest risk of introducing tgev is through the importation of pigs from endemically infected countries seronegative pigs of all ages are susceptible to infection with tgev 1 21 22 with the route of infection typically being oral or oral-nasal 23 24 to prevent tgev from entering a naive herd it is important to introduce only animals from tgev-free and serologically negative herds along with disciplined biosecurity therefore quarantine and testing for tgev-seronegative animals are requirements for exportimport into a herd moreover the detection of tgev antibodies particularly in reproductive animals can assist in diagnosis and control of the disease however tgev serology is complicated by cross-reactivity with prcv 5 an s protein deletion mutant of tgev with altered tissue tropism nonenteropathogenic but respiratory that circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide 7 9 25 this cross-reactivity may explain why a region endemic for prcv has less tgev-associated disease 26 porcine respiratory coronavirus does not cause significant losses in swine except for its contribution to the porcine respiratory disease complex historically prcv diagnosis was based on recognition of respiratory disease in growing pigs that have high antibody titers to tgev but have had no clinical enteric disease or lesions of atrophic enteritis conventional serological tests such as virus neutralization indirect fluorescent antibody agar-gel precipitation indirect immunoperoxidase radioimmunoprecipitation and some elisas based on polyclonal tgev antibodies cannot be used for differentiation between tgev and prcv because the two viruses share antigenic determinants located on the spike s membrane m nucleoprotein n and envelope e structural proteins 27 28 the exception is a large deletion 227 amino acids in length in the amino terminus of the prcv s protein that is responsible for the loss of hemagglutination activity 29 this deletion provided the opportunity to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for differentiation of prcv and tgev infections and laid the basis for the commercial tgevprcv differential elisas that are currently available 1720 few field reports have described the use of tgevprcv blocking elisas to differentiate antibodies to tgev and prcv and their utility at the herd level 26 30 31 however no previous reports have compared the diagnostic performances of different commercially available tgevprcv blocking elisas in this study we assessed and compared the diagnostic performances sensitivity specificity and cross-reactivity of three commercial differential tgevprcv blocking elisa kits ie swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa biovet canada ingezim corona diferencial elisa ingenasa spain and svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit svanova sweden at the individual pig level using experimental samples of precisely known porcine coronavirus immune status the use of samples with the same diseaseimmune status allowed for accurate interpretation of test results including those that were discordant or unexpectedmolecular diagnostic methods eg in situ hybridization and multiplex rrt-pcr targeting both the conserved and prcv deletion regions are utilized to differentiate tgev and prcv in infected pigs 8 32 33 specimens primarily used for tgev virus detection include feces and intestinal contents and those for prcv detection include nasal swabs or lung homogenates in this study the verification and monitoring of the tgev or prcv viral shedding status were performed using rrt-pcr testing of pen-based feces and oral fluids this process provided further information on the dynamics of viral shedding in feces versus oral fluids viral shedding was detected in both feces and oral fluids however for pigs inoculated with prcv and interestingly for tgev purdue virus shedding was only detected in oral fluids this could be related to differences in pathogenicity and tissue tropism which were beyond the scope of this study these results indicated that oral fluids may replace feces as a more suitable specimen for direct detection and surveillance of tgevprcv by rrt-pcroverall we observed differences in the test performances of the three commercial elisa kits evaluated in this study however the differences were more marked for the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit compared to either the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa or the ingezim corona diferencial elisa for which test performance was comparable this could be due to differencessimilarities in assay design for instance both the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa and the ingezim corona diferencial elisa use a tgev recombinant s protein antigen on a plate while the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa claims to use noninfectious tgev antigen of an unknown source which could detect antibodies to a variety of viral proteins the way the antigen is presented may also affect assay performance the antigen can either be bound directly to the plate wells as in the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa and svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa or may be captured by antigen-specific antibodies immobilized on the plate as in the ingezim corona diferencial elisa in addition the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa is the only kit using unlabeled tgev and tgevprcv mouse monoclonal antibodies mabs which requires an additional incubation step with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase hrp-conjugated secondary antibody undisclosed differences in buffer composition could also be involved in the differences in assay performance among the kitsall three elisa kits showed higher diagnostic sensitivity in the detection of anti-tgev antibodies in pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller 779 to 944 than in pigs inoculated with tgev strain purdue 653 to 789 regardless of the kit used the differences in diagnostic sensitivity among tgev-inoculated groups could be due to strain-related differences in virulence which may have impacted the magnitude of the immune response indeed in this study pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller showed mild watery diarrhea between 2 and 4 dpi while no clinical signs or viral shedding in feces were observed in the pigs inoculated with tgev purduethe diagnostic specificity of the three commercial elisa kits was evaluated on pigs of precisely known negative porcine coronavirus immune status ie the porcine coronavirus negative-control group to rule out potential cross-reactivity with other porcine coronaviruses ie pigs virologically and serologically negative for pedv pdcov porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev tgev and prcv all three kits evaluated in this study showed excellent diagnostic specificity ranging from 99 svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa to 100 swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa and ingezim corona diferencial elisa these results were consistent with previous reports in the field where a tgevprcv blocking elisa ie swinecheck and biovet showed a diagnostic specificity of 100 in wild boar populations historically free from coronavirus disease 34 with the final goal of maximizing both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity but understanding that there is a balance between the two parameters diagnostic specificity is of paramount importance during tgevprcv screening due to the impact of false-positive results on global pig trade operations the false-positive rate of any diagnostic test is a function of the specificity of the test and the prevalence of the diseasethe assessment of the selectivity of the antigen-antibody response analytical specificity was conducted on each of the three commercial blocking elisas using a panel of heterologous monotypic known-status-positive sera generated under experimental conditions specifically in this study the analysis of the analytical specificity was circumscribed to the cross-reactivity between tgev strains purdue and miller and prcv however the potential cross-reactivity between tgevprcv against other swine coronaviruses has previously been reported 35 a test was considered analytically specific for tgev or prcv when it did not react against heterologous positive sera as with the diagnostic sensitivity the overall analytical specificity varied among and across kits and groups of inoculation even with intrakit variations depending upon the interpretation of suspect results serological cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv was previously reported by use of an immunoblotting assay based on tgevprcv structural proteins s m and n and polyclonal antisera 11 this study further confirms that the serological cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv is significant even when using tgevprcv differential blocking elisas overall in this study we observed a poor analytical specificity ie high cross-reactivity for prcv antibody detection in pigs exposed to tgev strain purdue 63 to 72 with no significant differences among kits however with the exception of the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa 76 to 84 we found an acceptable analytical specificity for prcv antibody detection in pigs exposed to tgev miller using the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa 91 to 92 and the ingezim corona diferencial elisa 95 current tgevprcv differential immunoassays are based on a blocking elisa format which is inherently more specific than indirect elisas in the blocking elisa format the degree to which specific antibodies in the test serum sample prevent binding of an agent-specific mab is measured therefore the higher the levels of specific antibodies are in a serum sample the lower the likelihood for cross-reactivity in fact the overall higher tgev antibody detection rate observed within the group inoculated with tgev strain miller correlates with the lower cross-reactivity against prcv that would also explain the overall higher rate of serologic cross-reactivity regardless of the elisa kit used reported during the first few weeks postinoculation when specific antibody levels are still lowprevious reports indicated that the accuracy of the commercial tgevprcv blocking elisas for differentiating between us tgev and prcv strains was low 14 15 25 individual test results must be interpreted with caution particularly in the event of suspect results we have demonstrated that interpretation of suspect results can impact significantly the diagnostic performance of any of the commercial kits evaluated in this study with differences in their robustness in response to changes in the interpretation of suspect results while analytical specificity improved overall when suspect results were interpreted as negative this often comes at the cost of diagnostic sensitivity in the event of suspect undetermined or unexpected positive results it is recommended that serology testing on paired serum samples be conducted in which a second sample should be drawn 10 to 14 days after the first sample collection paired serum samples should be tested together to maximize the diagnostic value of test results moreover false-positive results reported at early stages postexposure when animals are actively shedding virus could be confirmed by rrt-pcr on oral fluid specimens as evidenced in this studythe presence of tgev remains a barrier to international livestock trade 36 the blocking elisa format alone was determined to be useful in large swine populations for the detection of tgev-infected herds moreover the ability to specifically detect prcv antibodies minimized the probability of false-positive tgev results and subsequent exclusion of those herds for trading however this study demonstrates that the serologic cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv at the individual pig level affects the accuracy of commercial blocking elisas therefore it is important to remember that the tgevprcv blocking elisas should only be applied on a herd basis 14 15 17 19known-status serum samples n  528 collected from pigs

swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant biovet canada ii ingezim corona diferencial ingenasa spain and iii svanovir tgevprcv-ab svanova sweden all assays were performed according to the manufacturers instructions the pig serum samples and controls were first added to the tgev antigen-coated wells for the first incubation step in the ingezim corona diferencial elisa plate wells are coated with a recombinant tgev s protein which is captured by a specific monoclonal antibody mab the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa is also based on a recombinant tgev s protein but directly coated on plate wells while the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa uses noninfectious tgev antigen source unknown as a coating antigen if anti-tgev or anti-prcv antibodies are present in the test sample they will bind to the viral tgev antigen in the wells and block the antigenic sites in contrast if anti-tgev or anti-prcv antibodies are absent in the test sample these sites will remain free then after a washing step to eliminate unbound antibodies a horseradish peroxidase hrp-conjugated mouse anti-tgev mab targeting the n-terminal region of the s glycoprotein that is deleted in prcv or an anti-tgevprcv mab that binds to conserved regions of both tgev and prcv is added into the first well odd column or second well even column respectively and attaches to specific free sites of the virus thus when antibodies in the test sample occupy the binding sites on the antigen the binding of the conjugated mabs is blocked if anti-tgev or anti-prcv antibodies are absent in the test sample these sites will remain free the amount of antibody in the test sample that is bound to the tgev antigen is inversely proportional to the intensity of the color antibody elisa results were expressed as the percentage of

laboratories that depend on these animal facilities1 there are numerous examples of disease in research animal populations compromising the research results derived from the projects2 the presence of mouse hepatitis virus3 mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice4 helicobacter spp5 mycoplasma pulmonis and sendai virus6 and mousepox7 have all confused research results routine monitoring of the prevalence of the various rat and mouse pathogens is useful to the research and laboratory animal community because it allows researchers to assess whether various diseases are increasing or decreasing in importance in a particular animal population in a particular country mice and rats are susceptible to approximately 40 different viral bacterial and parasitic diseases2 many agents cause severe disease often resulting in death but other diseases may be subclinical maintained in an animal colony for a long period of time or clinically silent yet affect research results in subtle ways2 there is also a risk that infectious agents may contaminate animal products such as cell lines and antibodies health monitoring may be expensive and the knowledge of which diseases are common or rare in a local setting is very useful so that frequency of testing and sample size can be adjusted accordinglythe increase in number and availability of genetically modified rodent models has expanded the use and number of animals in research facilities all over the world2 in addition the rapid rise in the use of transgenic and knockout mice has resulted in greater numbers of immunocompromised animals in research facilities transgenic animals are often more susceptible to a greater number of infectious agents than are non-transgenic rodents and are also prone to certain rare diseases8 as populations of transgenic rodents grow it becomes more difficult to eliminate many of these diseases9 for these reasons it is important to monitor immunocompromised populations more frequently using different disease panels than those used for healthy rats and micewe carried out a retrospective analysis that presents an accurate assessment of the common and rare diseases in rat and mice colonies in research establishments in australasia a previous report identified mouse norovirus mouse parvovirus mouse hepatitis virus rotavirus theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev helicobacter spp pasteurella pneumotropica and pinworms as common pathogens in mice from animal facilities in north america and europe10 the same report identified rat respiratory virus rat parvoviruses rat theilovirus also known as tmev helicobacter spp p pneumotropica and pinworms as common pathogens in rats from animal facilities in north america and europe10 we wished to establish whether similar diseases exist in laboratory rats and mice in australasia knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used as well as the predictive value of positive and negative test results is useful to allow laboratory animal workers to assess the seriousness of the consequences of a positive result10 we retrospectively analyzed the serological microbiological parasitological and molecular

tables 5 and 6 the most common positive helminthological finding in mice and rats was the presence of pinworms including aspicularis spp and syphacia spp the most common protozoan finding in mice was chilomastix spp and trichomonadsthis study is not comprehensive but is the first report to our knowledge on the microbiological status of laboratory mice and rats in australasia the most commonly requested viral serological test in mice was that for mouse hepatitis virus in rats the most commonly requested serological test was that for parvovirus testing requests probably reflect current knowledge of outbreaks and therefore skew results the popularity of test requests was not reflected in the prevalence of various diseases however norovirus was the most prevalent virus in laboratory mice in this studythese data may include false positive and false negative results although every effort was made to use secondary tests to confirm positive results furthermore the animals submitted to cerberus sciences may not be a representative sample of the research rodent population because institutes are more likely to submit animal during or after a disease outbreak and because not all research institutes in the region submit their routine health monitoring samples to cerberus sciences other health monitoring companies may also be involved in addition some laboratory animal colonies are tested more frequently than others9 although cerberus sciences encourages research institutes to submit animals for routine monitoring throughout the year we also note that these data cannot be compared directly with prevalence rates reported in other publications as each report presents data in different waysour results indicate that in mice submitted between 2004 and 2009 in australasia norovirus was the most prevalent virus 2592 currently mouse norovirus is the most prevalent viral pathogen identified in mice in laboratory animal facilities in the us and canada17 in 2005 the seroprevalence of norovirus in a large number of murine research colonies in the us and canada was reported to be 221 ref 17 and in 2009 the prevalence of norovirus in mice in north america was reported to be 32 the most prevalent virus in the survey10 norovirus can be fatal in immunodeficient mice but does not cause clinical signs or death in immunocompetent mice17mouse hepatitis virus was the second most prevalent virus in mice in our study 386 it is an important virus in non-spf-housed mice in the us2 in taiwan in 2007 more than 20 of mouse colonies tested were positive for mouse parvovirus mouse hepatitis virus tmev and m pulmonis18 this is similar to prevalence reported in the us19 europe10 korea20 france21 and taiwan18in 2006 parvoviruses kilham rat virus toolans h-1 virus and rat parvovirus were reported to be the most prevalent viruses in rats in europe9 non-spf-housed rats are reported to be at risk for sialodacryoadenitis and coronavirus which includes sialodacryoadenitis virus and rat coronavirus parvovirus and m pulmonis2 almost 40 of tested rat colonies in taiwan were positive for m pulmonis and rat parvovirus with fewer colonies positive for kilham rat virus sialodacryoadenitis virus pneumonia virus of mice sendai virus and syphacia spp18 in 1978 rat sialodacryoadenitis virus was the most prevalent pathogen in rats in the uk22 but in our study the most prevalent virus in rats was pneumonia virus of mice followed by parvovirus rat coronavirus tmev and mouse adenoviruses 1 and 2in contrast to results from taiwan18 we did not find any positive serological tests for hantavirus in rats or mice we did find a low prevalence of tmev in both mice and rats although only mice are thought to be involved in endemic infections serological evidence of ectromelia virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in non-spf-housed mice has been reported1 and we found serological evidence of ectromelia virus in mice in our study an absence of serological evidence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and ectromelia virus was noted in 1978 in the uk23 indicating that the prevalence of these pathogens was already declining in that region at that time in 1980 mouse hepatitis virus was prevalent in mouse colonies and the prevalence of sendai virus was increasing2224 mouse hepatitis virus is highly contagious which likely accounts for its continued prevalence10in contrast the prevalence of sendai virus in rats and mice has recently declined in france21 the incidence and prevalence of sendai virus has also declined in the us and europe10 and our data indicate that its prevalence is declining in australasia as well in 2005 decreases in the prevalence of pneumonia virus of mice reovirus type 3 sendai virus sialodacryoadenitis and m pulmonis in europe were reported9 additionally k virus and polyoma virus were reported to have been eliminated from laboratory animal colonies9 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus k virus ectromelia virus mouse adenovirus and mouse thymic virus had not been detected for over 10 yearsour results indicate that helicobacter spp were the most prevalent bacteria in mice and that proteus spp were the most prevalent bacteria in rats this is in contrast with recent reports that most prevalent bacteria in rats and mice are helicobacter spp particularly h hepaticus25 m pulmonis is still prevalent in rats and mice in australasia but is of declining importance in the us and europe10 we found no positive tests for streptobacillus moniliformis in either rats or mice although an outbreak of this disease was reported in australia in swiss white mice in 1996 ref 26the most common positive helminthological finding in mice and rats was the presence of all pinworms including aspicularis spp and syphacia spp the most common positive protozoan finding in mice and rats was the presence of chilomastix spp and trichomonads we used three different tests for the detection of helminths and protozoa external anal tape tests iodine wet preparations of cecal and duodenal mucosa and fecal contents and fecal flotation tests in addition the veterinary pathologist often made mention of the presence of helminths and protozoa in the gastrointestinal system upon histopathological examination using multiple detection methods helps to minimize false-negative results a previous report cautioned against the use of perianal tape impressions alone to screen for syphacia spp in sentinel rats and mice27 syphacia spp infestations in rats and mice have occurred in laboratory animal colonies for many years28 and remain a problem1our results could potentially be influenced by the fact that most institutes use a soiled-bedding sentinel system which tends to favor the detection of agents transmitted primarily by the oro-fecal route the prevalence of agents transmitted primarily by aerosol or contact could be underestimated in this system using a combination of direct-contact and soiled-bedding sentinels and testing exhaled air is the best strategy for detecting infection18the barrier-housing status of animals submitted to cerberus sciences was not always stated and therefore was not analyzed in this study in spf-housed rats parvovirus coronavirus pneumonia virus of mice tmev and pinworms are reportedly very common1 in spf-housed mice mouse hepatitis virus parvovirus ectoparasites endoparasites and pathogenic helicobacter spp have been reported12 these reports are similar to our findings which suggests that these agents are problematic in both spf-housed and non-spf-housed animals there is a risk of cross-infection between spf and non-spf housing units1 the definition of spf should be refined and standardized throughout the community1establishing a judicious testing strategy diagnosing pathogens rapidly controlling identified outbreaks and using animals with known microbiological profiles can help to prevent disease outbreaks in animal facilities in research institutes1 the introduction of serological screening programs and advances in laboratory animal husbandry and disease knowledge have resulted in a decrease in the number of infected laboratory animal colonies9 despite improvements in husbandry and surveillance however much more can be done to safeguard the health of rodents used in biomedical facilities29 inadequate finances facilities and staffing a lack of compliance with recommended or required practices and regulatory constraints all contribute to inadequate health monitoring in animal facilities1the prevalence of various diseases may have increased recently as institutes house large numbers of transgenic mice and rats that are often immunocompromised10 in japan genetically modified mice had positive serological tests for m pulmonis mouse parvovirus and tmev30 indicating that genetically modified mice are highly susceptible to common laboratory animal pathogens8 although live animals are tested regularly few institutions test external animal products such as cell lines serum and transplantable tumors1 the exchange of animals and biological products between animal institutes has been responsible for some disease outbreaks9little information is available on the prevalence of disease in laboratory rats and mice in australia but the prevalence of viral antibodies and helminths in field populations of wild mice in southeastern australia has been examined31 mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus rotavirus minute virus of mice mouse adenovirus reovirus and mouse cytomegalovirus and the presence of taenia taeniaformis syphacia oblevata and vampirolepsis spp was detected these results were similar to those in another report which additionally detected m pulmonis sendai virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and parvovirus in wild mice32 the seroprevalence of mouse cytomegalovirus is far greater in wild populations 61733 than in our study 002 in a serological survey of virus infection among wild house mice mus domesticus in the uk mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus mouse cytomegalovirus mouse thymic virus mouse adenovirus mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice34 testing of rodent-borne pathogens carried by wild-caught norway rats in the us detected antibodies against rat coronavirus m pulmonis cilia-associated respiratory bacillus rat parvovirus kilham rat virus toolans h-1 virus sendai virus and tmev35 these reports suggest that many of the pathogens that remain problematic for laboratory rodents are also encountered in wild mice and ratsalthough our panel includes tests for relatively new agents such as mouse norovirus and helicobacter spp future panels may need to include rat respiratory virus36 and rat minute virus rat respiratory virus is the working name for a new respiratory pathogen of laboratory rats in north america europe and asia causing pneumonitis and alveolar hyperplasia in the lungs36 the agent is now thought to be pneumocystis carinii37 in future lung samples from rats will need to be tested by histopathology and the pcr to assess the prevalence of p cariniiregular reporting of prevalence of laboratory rodent pathogens is important so that health-monitoring programs can be updated938 although our study is not a comprehensive study of laboratory animals in australasia this 5-y retrospective analysis gives an overview of the prevalence of common viral bacterial and parasitological diseases in laboratory rats and mice these data help to identify which agents are common or rare in laboratory rats and mice in australasia we agree with others who have recommended that research institutes obtain animals from reputable vendors quarantine newly arrived animals maintain animals in adequate housing with trained personnel and test regularly to determine the disease status of research animalsit can be difficult to decide what infectious agents to screen for in canine and feline transfusion medicine factors to consider are the transmissibility of the particular agent via transfusion the consequence of acquiring the agent to the recipient and the prevalence of the agent in the region where the donor lives or travels once infectious agents for screening are selected the appropriate test must be selected typically screening tests are tests with high sensitivity and are used because the incidence of false negativity is low confirmatory tests have high specificity and a low incidence of false positivity cost is another factor to be considered because screening for an exorbitant number of diseases may make blood-component therapy cost prohibitive efforts to minimize potential exposure to infectious diseases by controlling the environments of donors ie minimize travel and exposure to new animals and initiating ectoparasite prevention programs are necessaryin human transfusion medicine decisions concerning the suitability of individual donors are made with a number of factors in mind in the united states there are several viral diseases that all units are tested for before administration all potential donors complete detailed questionnaires the results of which may exclude individuals based on their history of travel and sexual behavior although tick-borne diseases are not currently routinely screened for a recent increase in human exposure to tick pathogens has lead to reinvestigation of this practice elimination of human donors because of travel history or region within the united states is impractical the potential for subclinical disease carriers and the possibility that the testing could be performed during the incubation period of the disease further complicates screening for tick-borne pathogens also many people who acquire tick-borne diseases have no recollection of tick exposure and there is a similar potential in pets4 similar concerns occur when selecting small animal donorshuman donors are screened for defined infectious agents at each donation this is infrequently performed in veterinary patients the appropriate interval for screening veterinary blood donors to date is undefined the type of donor situation may influence the frequency of testing ie closed colony donors vs volunteer-based programs it would be ideal to perform all screening tests on presentation and then again in 3 months for closed colonies this frequency should be adequate for volunteer donors annual testing should be performed all donors involved must receive monthly ectoparasite prophylaxis to limit exposure to vectors of disease transmission when screening donors it is essential to obtain a very thorough travel history before each donation to determine if additional infectious agents should be considered a physical examination should be performed at each donation because many subtle clinical signs of infectious disease ie fever anemia joint swelling can be noticedfeline lukemia virus felv is an oncornavirus that is transmitted typically via saliva where concentration of the virus is highest viremic cats shed the virus constantly this is a disease that can be transmitted via blood transfusion if the donor is viremic all donor cats should be screened for felv regardless of previous testing before admission to a donor program5 the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa test for the p27 core antigen is the best screening test all positive cats should be excluded from blood donation6 cats that are free roaming should be excluded from donor programs given their constant potential exposure as well as the possibility of latent viral infectionfeline immunodeficiency virus fiv is a lentivirus that is transmitted via saliva or blood presumably by bite or fight wounds fiv has been transmitted experimentally via intravenous administration7 the ideal screening test for fiv is the elisa test for fiv-specific antibodies all positive cats should be excluded from blood donation as with felv cats that are free roaming should be excluded from donor programs given their constant potential exposurefeline infectious peritonitis fip is a clinical syndrome induced by infection by some coronaviruses in a suitable host coronaviruses are primarily enteric pathogens that are primarily transmitted through virus-containing feces or saliva and close contact however based on reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr performed on blood it is known that both enteric and fip-inducing coronaviruses are present in the blood of some cats8 however rt-pcr test results cannot determine whether a cat will develop fip in addition to date there have been no reports of fip developing in a cat after administration of coronavirus-containing blood products currently available serological test results cannot discern whether a cat has been exposed to an enteric coronavirus or to a coronavirus capable of inducing fip because seroprevalence of coronavirus antibodies and prevalence of coronavirus viremia determined by rt-pcr are high serological or rt-pcr test results do not correlate with development of fip and fip has never been associated with a blood transfusion so that coronavirus serological or rt-pcr screening of feline donors is not currently recommendedehrlichiosis is caused by a group of obligate intracellular parasites of the genus ehrlichia of the family rickettsiaceae e canis-like dna 3 cats in north america and 2 cats in france has been amplified from naturally exposed cats by using pcr assays9 although morulae morphologically similar to e canis have been detected in mononuclear cells in some cats it is unknown if other organisms in this group infect cats10 11 attempts to induce e canis infection of cats experimentally have failed to date personal communication mr lappin 2004 antibodies that seroreact with e canis morulae were detected in the serum of 132 of 344 cats screened in the united states however it is currently unknown if these cats were truly infected by an ehrlichia spp12 some cats with pcr-confirmed e canis infections have been antibody negative and there is disagreement between laboratories on e canis-test results using feline serum9 because there is currently no standardization between serologic tests for e canis infection in cats and results have been variable use of these tests to determine the infection status of clinically healthy cats to be used as blood donors cannot currently be recommended detection of ehrlichia spp dna by pcr confirms current infection however in recent pcr-based studies e canis was not detected in the blood of feral cats in north central florida13 nor in the blood of cats used as blood donors in the united states14 in addition there have been no reports of feline ehrlichiosis acquired via blood transfusion thus ehrlichia spp infections of cats are probably rare most cats with clinical ehrlichiosis have had fever or cytopenias9 10 if a cat being screened for use as a blood donor has a history of these clinical abnormalities then it would be prudent to screen for ehrlichia spp infection by pcr of blood to lessen the risk of exposure to these agents community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicated although clinically ill cats respond to doxycycline or imidocarb treatment it is unknown whether infection is eliminated thus cats known to have been infected by an ehrlichia spp should not be used as blood donors in the futurefeline anaplasmosis is caused by anaplasma phagocytophilum the organism previously known as e equi human granulocytic ehrlichial agent e phagocytophila and the granulocytic ehrlichial agent of dogs15 16 experimentally infected cats developed morulae in neutrophils and eosinophils not mononuclear cells a phagocytophilum 5 cats in north america several cats in sweden denmark and the united kingdom has been amplified from naturally exposed cats by using pcr assays17 this infectious agent appears to be transmitted by ixodes ticks so cats in those regions of the united states should be considered at greater risk than cats in other regions there is one known case of transfusion-induced infection unpublished data mr lappin 2004 to date cats with clinical anaplasmosis have developed detectable titers but it is unknown how long positive titers persist because there is currently no standardization between serologic tests for a phagocytophilum infection in cats use of these tests to determine the infection status of clinically healthy cats to be used as blood donors cannot currently be recommended a phagocytophilum was not detected in the blood of 118 cats used as blood donors in the united states14 most cats with clinical anaplasmosis have had fever thrombocytopenia or a history of ixodes ticks17 if a cat being screened for use as a blood donor has a history of these clinical abnormalities then it would be prudent to screen for a phagocytophilum infection by pcr of blood to lessen the risk of exposure to this agent community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicated although clinically ill cats respond to treatment with doxycycline it is unknown whether infection is eliminated thus cats known to have been infected by a phagocytophilum should not be used as blood donors in the futurecats have been experimentally infected with neorickettsia risticii previously e risticii and developed morulae in mononuclear cells16 18 some cats developed clinical signs of disease including fever depression lymphadenopathy anorexia and diarrhea in one seroepidemiological study antibodies that reacted with n risticii morulae were detected in 645 of 344 cats tested12 however n risticii has never been amplified by the blood of a naturally exposed cat the organism was not detected in the blood of 118 cats used as blood donors in the united states14 and there are no known cases of transfusion-induced infections in cats because there is currently no standardization between serologic tests for n risticii infection in cats use of serological tests to determine the infection status of clinically healthy cats to be used as blood donors cannot currently be recommended if a cat being screened for use as a blood donor is to be screened for e canis and a phagocytophilum infections by pcr then primers that also amplify the dna of n risticii should be used to lessen the risk of exposure to this agent community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicatedcyauxzoonosis is caused by cytauxzoon felis a protozoan parasite in the order piroplasmida and family theileriidae the epizoology of c felis in the united states is relatively unknown though it is generally found in the southeastern united states ticks are believed to be the natural vector for transmission infections of naturally exposed cats and those induced experimentally by intravenous inoculation are almost invariably fatal there have been rare reports of the survival of cats naturally infected with c felis the explanation for the survival of these cats is unclear although innate immunity alternate virulent strain and a different signet-ring shaped piroplasm were all considered to be possibilities18 there is no serologic or pcr test commercially available for c felis and therefore examination of blood smears is the only diagnostic test readily available community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and placed on tick prophylaxis to minimize the likelihood of acquiring c feliscats are known to be infected by at least 4 bartonella spp including bhenselae b clarridgeiae b koehlerae and b weissii b henselae and b clarridgeaie are both associated with cat-scratch disease in people b henselae is a small curved gram-negative intraerythrocytic bacterium experimentally b henselae the organism has been transmitted between cats by c felis and by intravenous subcutaneous sq intramuscular and intradermal id inoculation naturally exposed cats and their fleas are commonly pcr positive for b henselae and b clarridgeaie17 a serologic survey of the united states and western canada revealed that overall 279 of healthy pet cats were seropositive with regional ranges varying from 69 to 56 table 1
19 in a study of cats used as community-practice blood donors in the united states 2 of 118 cats were pcr positive for b henselae14
after infection by b henselae most cats become seropositive with a variable duration of bacteremia transient fever anorexia uveitis and peripheral lymphadenopathy are the most common clinical abnormalities recognized in both experimentally infected and naturally exposed cats20 currently the association between b henselae and other clinical diseases of cats such as gingivitis is being explored to date an association between feline blood transfusion and clinical bartonellosis has not been madedetection of b henselae antibodies proves previous or current infection detection of bartonella spp by blood culture or pcr proves current infection primers are currently available that amplify many bartonella spp however the sensitivity of the assay in naturally exposed cats is unknown21 a pcr- or blood-culture- negative and antibody-negative cat is unlikely to be infected with b henselae cats to be used as blood donors with a previous history consistent with clinical bartonellosis or with a history of flea exposure should be screened for bartonellosis if negative flea control should be maintained during the time the cat is used as a blood donor if found to be positive in any test then the cat should be excluded from the blood-donor program because treatment does not consistently lead to the elimination of bacteremiafeline hemoplasmosis previously hemobartonellosis is caused by mycoplasma hemofelis previously the large form or ohio strain and candidatus m hemominutum previously the small form or california strain22 23 24 these bacteria are associated with feline infectious anemia and can result in fever and severe hemolytic anemia in infected cats24 most m hemofelis isolates are more pathogenic than m hemominutum isolates but only limited numbers of isolates have been studied25 26 both hemoplasmas have been detected in the blood of cats and c felis taken from their bodies17 the cat flea has been shown to be a competent vector for m hemofelis27
as little as 1 ml of blood from an chronically infected carrier cat can induce clinical illness in adult cats25 26 28 it is currently unknown how long stored feline blood containing hemoplasmas is infectious a recent study of 118 community-practice-based blood-donor cats in the united states showed 14 to be carrying one or both hemoplasms14
there is no commercial serological test for feline hemoplasmosis cytological diagnosis is inaccurate in healthy cats with both false-positive and false-negative results being common it is well documented that the storage of whole blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid will lead to the organism falling off the associated red blood cell within 6 hours after storagepcr is now considered the test of choice for screening cats for hemoplasmosis a recent study documented positive results in 100 of experimentally inoculated cats versus 375 positive on peripheral blood smear from the same cats26 pcr assays that amplify the dna of both species are currently available commercially29
cats to be used as community-practice blood donors should be screened for both hemoplasmas by pcr if negative then flea control should be maintained while the cat is being used as a blood donor if found to be positive for either species then the cat should be excluded from the blood-donor program because treatment with tetracyclines azithromycin or enrofloxacin does not consistently lead to the elimination of bacteremia25 26 28
the ehrlichia sp are small gram-negative bacteria that are transmitted via tick bite dogs can be naturally infected by e canis most commonly e ewingii and e chafeensis dogs with ehrlichiosis will most commonly present with depression lethargy mild weight loss and anorexia potential exists for bleeding disorders many assymptomatic dogs will seroconvert after exposure clinical signs may develop months to years after initial exposure or they may never occur this provides the greatest challenge when screening potential blood donors serology ifa is the most widely used test for diagnosing ehrlichiosis dogs with titers of 180 are considered suspect for having ehrlichiosis and should be excluded from donor programs recently a commercial elisa test kit has become available for e canis for in-hospital use snap 3dx-idexx laboratories westbrook me this test has been shown to have overall agreement of 91 when compared with the ifa test although its sensitivity was lower when titers were 132031 interestingly this test is combined with an assay for dirofilaria immitis and borrelia burgdorfi it may be more cost effective to use this test during the initial screening dogs that have a negative result with the snap 3dx should have an ifa titer run to assure a negative titer ideally genus specific rt-pcr should be performed on dogs that are seronegative on ifa11 donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectorsthere has only been one potential incident of transfusion-related transmission of a phagocytophium the etiologic agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in people32 canine anaplasmosis is also cause by a phagocytophilum it has been identified as the causative agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis33 clinical signs include anorexia lethargy conjunctivitis fever lameness and ataxia34 ifa serology is commonly used for the detection of a phagocytophilum infection in dogs with titers of 180 being considered seroreactive this test can frequently be false positive35 rt-pr has also been used to detect ehrlichial dna in infected dogs36 the potential for chronic carrier states exists therefore dogs that have tested positive for it should not be used as blood donors donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectorsdogs have been naturally infected with n risticii37 experimental infection via inoculation has been achieved as well38
n risticii has known cross-reactivity with e canis35 although individual serologic assays are available and should ideally be performed on screening donors the potential for chronic carrier states exists therefore dogs that have tested positive for it should not be used as blood donors donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectorsrocky mountain spotted fever is caused by the obligate intracellular parasite rickettsia rickettsi rocky mountain spotted fever differs from other rickettsial diseases in that it is an acute disease ie chronic carrier states with delayed-onset clinical signs is not reported patients with rocky mountain spotted fever will manifest clinical signs ie fever thrombocytopenia vasculitis etc with the clinical course of the disease typically running about 2 weeks or less39 dogs will however seroconvert to r rickettsii antigen without clinical illness these dogs have been shown to have rickettsial dna by using rt-pcr this may actually represent seroconversion against another unidentified organism in the spotted fever group rickettsiae30 physical examination and routine-screening laboratory testing should be sufficient to eliminate the likelihood of transmission
babesia canis and b gibsoni are the 2 species of tick-borne hematozoan organisms that cause natural infection in the dog babesia is naturally transmitted by the bite of an infected ixodid tick after infection the host immune response may result in a chronic carrier state without significant clinical signs there are regional distribution ie the gulf coast and breed-susceptibility differences ie greyhounds pitt bull terriers that need to be considered when developing a testing plan39 40 a travel history should be acquired before each donation and retesting performed when indicated
b microti is the most common reported transfusion-transmitted tick-borne disease in people41 42 43 most naturally occurring babesia infections are asymptomatic in people although not typical babesiosis can be fatal in immunosuppressed or geriatric patients which represent a large portion of the recipient pool41
the diagnosis of clinical babesiosis relies on direct microscopy ifa serology or pcr healthy dogs can be carriers of babesiosis without significant parasitemia because direct microscopy relies on parasitemia this test is not likely to be useful as a screening test ifa is readily available and has a rapid turnaround the pcr is a more specific test and should be run on high-risk dogs that have a negative serology
b canis has been transmitted and caused fulminant babesiosis acute hypotensive shock from an unscreened greyhound donor this dog responded to treatment for shock and treatment with clindamycin3 there is a recent report of a clinical case of transfusion-transmitted b gibsoni from an unscreened donor the recipient recovered from the initial hemolytic crisis although it remained infected with b gibsoni1 these reports illustrate the potentially devastating consequence of transfusion-associated babesiosis any potential donor with positive results from serologic screening or pcr testing should be excluded from the donor pool all donor dogs should be put on tick-preventative medications to minimize the likelihood of acquiring tick-borne diseasesthe leishmania donovani complex is a group of protozoan parasites that causes visceral leishmaniasis in dogs infected dogs can be reservoirs for infection in other dogs and people transmission of the disease is typically via sandflies in the mediterranean region this disease is rare in the united states with most cases associated with international travel sandflies are not present in the united states and the vector for endemic cases is unknownclinical diagnosis of leishmaniasis relies on direct microscopy serologic testing ifa and recently pcr given the low prevalence of the disease in the united states the decision to screen for this disease may be based on donor travel history and breed susceptibility as with babesiosis pcr testing should be performed in high-risk dogs that are seronegativefoxhounds are over-represented in cases not associated with international travel interestingly a recent serologic survery showed that 29 33112 of foxhounds in a kennel were seroreactive to leishmania antigens whereas beagles and basset hounds housed in the same kennel were seronegative and pcr negative 03044
there is a recent report of transmission of l infantum of the l donovani complex and the main cause of canine leishmaniasis to recipients of prbcs from infected foxhounds of 7 dogs that received infected prbc 3 developed serologic titers despite the development of titers not all dogs developed clinical illness2
any potential donor with positive results on serologic screening or pcr testing should be excluded from the donor pool donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors
trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan parasite that causes chagas disease this disease is more common in south and central america although it has been reported in the southeastern united states it is transmitted via insect vectors and has zoonotic potential chronic infection has been described a survey of dogs in oklahoma found that 36 of the healthy dogs surveyed were seropositive for t cruzi45 chagas disease has been transmitted via blood transfusion in dogs s barr personal communication january 2004diagnostic tests available for chagas disease include direct microscopy protozoal culture serology radioimmunopreciptation assay ifa complement fixation and pcr again serology provides the most rapid answers but pcr should be considered in seronegative patients with travel history or in endemic areas given the possibility of chronic carrier states dogs that test positive should be excluded from the donor pool
m hemocanis formerly hemobartonella canis is the agent that causes canine hemoplasmosis m hemocanis is transmitted by the brown dog tick it can be an incidental finding in healthy dogs but can cause anemia in dogs that are immunosuppressed or splenectomized39 there is a case report of a dog that developed clinical hemoplasmosis after simultaneously receiving a blood transfusion and splenectomy it is difficult to say whether this particular dog had m canis and developed signs after his spleen was removed or if he acquired h canis from the blood transfusion and was susceptible to it because of his splenectomy46 diagnosis of hemoplasmosis typically relies on visualization of the organism in red blood cells m canis can be detected with the pcr assay for h felis47 ideally a peripheral blood smear should be performed at the time of donation but detection in assymptomatic carriers may be difficult all donor dogs should be put on tick-preventative medications to minimize the likelihood of acquiring tick-borne diseases
bartonella vinsonii ssp berkhoffii is a small curved gram-negative bacteria that is vector transmitted although the specific vector is unknown it causes clinical disease in dogs characterized by endocarditis peliosis hepatitis and granulomatous disease it has been experimentally transmitted by intravenous administration48 the prevalence of antibodies to b vinsonii has been found to be 36 in sick dogs49 50 and 87 in healthy dogs diagnosis relies on the detection of antibodies by elisa or ifa it is possible for a healthy animal to be seropositive there are experimental pcr assays available for bartonella species51

brucella canis is a gram-negative bacteria that causes reproductive disturbances and can cause bacteremia and discospondylitis in dogs it is typically transmitted venereally via penetration through urogenital mucous membranes there is no experimental transmission of b canis through intravenous inoculation donor dogs that are sexually intact should be tested annually with a rapid slide-agglutination test the tube-agglutination test is the confirmatory test of choice positive dogs should be excluded from the donor populationideally all dogs should be screened for babesiosis leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis when regionally appropriate because these diseases are transmitted via blood transfusion see table 2 table 3
serious consideration should be given to screening for ehrlichiosis anaplasmosis neorickettsiosis hemoplasmosis brucellosis and bartonellosis cats should be screened for retroviral infections and hemoplasmosis serious consideration should be given to screening for bartonellosis ehrlichiosis anaplasmosis neorickettsiosis and cytauxzoanosis these diseases provide a reasonable foundation on which to base a donor-screening program the answer to whether many of these diseases can truly be transmitted is unclear and the ultimate decision of what to include in a panel may rest in the cost of screening donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors a product should be selected that will result in rapid and efficient removal of ticks because disease transmission typically takes at least 24 to 72 hours of tick blood feeding51
the outbreak of coronavirus disease covid-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who by the end of january 2020
1
 the first imported case of the disease in brazil was confirmed in february 2020 in the state of so paulo after a month the brazilian ministry of health moh recognized community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection throughout the national territory approximately 514000 confirmed cases of the disease were reported in brazil as of may 31 2020 including nearly 29000 deaths
2
 according to the moh because of the shortage of diagnostic tests most municipal monitoring systems have restricted testing to moderate-to-severe cases of covid-19 or those affecting health care professionals
3
 thus official statistics do not include mild or asymptomatic covid-19 cases it is estimated that up to 85 individuals infected with sars-cov-2 are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic
4
 mild or asymptomatic infections do not impact the health care system directly however individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection may infect others and may possibly develop a degree of immunity to reinfection therefore estimates of the total number of infected individuals in a region are important for health care planning projection of the epidemiological curve in the short and medium term scaling of demand for medical and hospital services and the establishment of expectations regarding group or herd immunity
5
 in may 2020 piau occupied the 20th position in the national ranking of brazilian states by covid-19 incidence
2
 it is possible that piau was in a delayed epidemic moment compared to other states of the federation data from the national civil aviation agency indicate that the state capital airport teresina has the second-lowest passenger flow in the country among the state capitals just ahead of aracaj airport in sergipe state which may in part justify this temporal difference
6
 given the possibility of the under-reporting of covid-19 cases and the impossibility of accounting for asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic sars-cov-2 infections through official records the municipal health foundation of teresina decided to perform sequential serological surveys this was intended to analyze the dynamics and dimension of the epidemic in the city plan health care interventions and project demand for hospital care serologic surveys were performed in seven testing rounds conducted at 1-week intervals between april 19 and may 31 2020 each round comprised testing of 900 individuals under probability sampling they were stratified by sex age and geographical distribution in the city these data were extracted from the household registry of 78 basic health units in the urban area of the capital the study was approved by the national research ethics committee registry no 123444 after signing an informed consent form the individuals were tested using a rapid covid-19 test guangzhou wondfo biotech co china which was performed according to the manufacturers instructions regardless of the presence or duration of symptoms the diagnostic kit provides a qualitative result positive or negative however it does not differentiate immunoglobulin ig m and igg antibodies according to the manufacturer it has a sensitivity of 86 and a specificity of 99 only if it is performed at least 8 days after the infection and has been certified by the national institute for quality control in health 
figure 1 shows the timeline progression of the positivity rate in the population sampled with 95 confidence intervals cis and a significance of 5 from the third survey the central estimate of positivity was higher than the false-positive rate expected for the test 1-specificity in the fifth survey it possible to certify a significant increase in the seroprevalence in the population sampled p  001 with a positive result detected in 378 95 ci 263-524 of the individuals tested 

the surveys reflected that sars-cov-2 infections are typically mild or asymptomatic and that data on reported cases does not represent the risk of infection up to 8 days before the completion of the seventh survey the municipality of teresina recorded 1699 confirmed covid-19 cases including 51 deaths
7
 given an estimated population of 864845 inhabitants according to the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge the seroprevalence in the seventh survey 833 95 ci 661-1033 suggests that 57166-89338 individuals had been infected in the capital this represents 33-53 persons infected for each reported case therefore the fatality rate of 3 calculated using the number of confirmed cases is overestimated and may reflect only the fatality rate among moderate-to-severe cases when considering the estimates for the total number of infected individuals the infection fatality rate varied between 006 and 009the results of the serological surveys performed in teresina permit the estimation of the progression of the total number of infected individuals over the 7 weeks studied however future projections of results are limited given the low positivity in the sample the overlapping of cis that are attributable to the percentage of positive tests and the expected limit for false-positive results of the diagnostic tests therefore estimates of the cis of the reproduction number calculated between each round of the study were very imprecise however the sensitivity of a test is generally assessed by its manufacturer by testing samples from more severe cases with a diagnosis confirmed by methods considered a reference standard in these patients the immune response can be more exuberant which can lead to an overestimation of the tests sensitivity in addition the tests used in the present study detect total antibodies against sars-cov-2 the use of diagnostic tests capable of discriminating igg from igm positivity would more reliably reflect the emergence of the actual recent infections at every stage of the study although the dynamics of serological response to sars-cov-2 infection remains obscure similar initiatives with state coverage have been implemented by researchers from the federal university of pelotas ufpel rio grande do sul state university and the federal university of piau state in partnership with the respective state public health departments however the positivity rates revealed in the initial stages have not exceeded the percentage of false-positive results estimated by the manufacturer of the diagnostic tests employed 1

9
 a study conducted in the municipality of so paulo detected a serologic positivity for sars-cov-2 in 5 of the individuals tested yet the sampling did not cover all neighborhoods of the city and was concentrated in the neighborhoods with the highest number of covid-19 cases
10
 in may 2020 a serological survey involving several brazilian cities was initiated by he ufpel which was endorsed by the moh with the participation of ibge
11
 in june 2020 a study performed in the state of rio de janeiro indicated that 28 blood donors had already produced antibodies against covid-19
12
 the results of the first nationwide seroprevalence study in spain showed that only 5 of the population had antibodies against sars-cov-2 based on a rapid antibody test
13
serological screening is an important tool that is used to understand the immunity of a population and distinguish individuals who are at lower risk of becoming ill nevertheless even though the serologic positivity for sars-cov-2 reflects the detection of serum antibodies produced in response to infection the who recommends caution in drawing conclusions regarding temporary or permanent immunity against covid-19 in individuals with positive tests
14
 in the absence of a short-term expectation for the large-scale implementation of vaccines against covid-19 and considering the expected impact of the pandemic on the populations health knowledge of the immune status of the inhabitants of a region and the proportion of infected people who will require hospital equipment is essential for public health managers to plan appropriate interventions the ongoing pandemic which originates from a newly emerged coronavirus sars-cov-2 was discovered in the city of wuhan in chinas hubei province in december 2019 1 to date due to rapid transmission globally there are more than two million laboratory-confirmed human infection cases with a few hundred thousand deaths across 210 countries and territories httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports this unprecedented crisis led to a worldwide effort to rapidly characterize the immunobiology of sars-cov-2 while mitigating further spread of this deadly pathogensars-cov-2 is a single stranded positive sense rna virus that belongs to the coronaviridae family of the betacoronavirus genus 2 it has a genome size of 30 kilobases that encodes for multiple structural proteins comprising the spike s the envelope e the membrane m and the nucleocapsid n as well as non-structural proteins 3 figure 1 infection by sars-cov-2 causes an acute respiratory disease termed the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the clinical manifestations of covid-19 form a spectrum from being asymptomatic to fever with mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death from respiratory failure or associated complications 35 as the reported incubation period varies among different patient cohorts it is often difficult to ascertain the actual day of onset and infected subjects who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic may go undetected 57early detection of sars-cov-2 infection is one of the crucial interventions to control virus transmission with the discovery of the virus numerous diagnostic assays using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr qrt-pcr were developed 3 qrt-pcr is the reference standard for diagnosing infections with high sensitivity and accuracy in the acute phase of illness sars-cov-2 viral rna has been detected in both throat and nasal swabs of infected individuals by qrt-pcr which becomes almost undetectable by 14 days post-illness onset pio or symptom onset 8 9 figure 2 apart from being costly and time consuming to perform false negative results may arise due to improper handling of nucleic acid samples inadequate and variable sampling resulting in insufficient viral genetic material at the point of detection after 14 days pio or biological variation on when viral rna is detectable by qrt-pcr 10 15 with the limitations of qrt-pcr immunoassays may offer another avenue to reduce undiagnosed cases with the advantage that rapid test formats may deliver results in a relatively shorter time and lower cost 10in recent pre-prints deposited in medxriv and bioxriv it was shown that both anti-sars-cov-2-igm and igg levels increase gradually along with infection phases with igm being detected as early as 3 days pio which peaks between two to three weeks pio 10 11 one study has reported that sars-cov-2-specific igm is still present in the serum after 1 month pio 12 sars-cov-2-specific igg antibodies on the other hand can be present as early as 4 days pio and peak after 17 days pio 10 11 figure 2 these observations are similar to what was previously reported during a sars-cov infection 21 however interestingly one study demonstrated that longitudinal profiling of both antibodies in a population of 63 covid-19 patients showed no specific chronological order in terms of igm and igg seroconversion 10 which was also observed in patients infected with sars-cov and another human coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 22 23 in addition there seems to be no correlation between seroconversion rates with age gender or time of hospitalization 10 these findings on sars-cov-2-specific antibodies seroconversion against the s viral protein suggest the importance to test for both igm and igg antibodies to confirm a positive infectionexpectedly similar to what was reported for sars-cov and mers-cov both igm and igg levels seems to be correlated with disease severity with a higher level of both antibodies present in patients with more severe sars-cov-2 infection 10 11 14 2426 in contrast to other flu-like infections such as influenza instead of igg1 igg3 appears to be the dominant igg subtype during sars-cov-2 infection 13 27 28as a majority of the human population has prior exposure to endemic human coronavirus infections including alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 and other betacoronaviruses oc42 and hku1 29 it is crucial to validate the specificity and sensitivity of current immunoassays against sars-cov-2 to avoid false positive outcomes within the s protein antigen cross-reactivity was observed when samples were tested against sars-cov s and s1 subunit proteins and to a smaller extent with mers-cov s protein table 1 interestingly there was no cross-reactivity with the s1 subunit of mers-cov 14 the high level of cross-reactivity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 can be attributed to the high degree of genetic homology 3 14 19 furthermore detailed analysis revealed a highly conserved s2 subunit domain across coronaviruses which may explain for the cross-reactivity observed with only the s protein of mers-cov and not with the s1 subunit 14 19 these data suggest that using an s1 subunit-based immunoassay may be more specific than the entire s antigen for diagnosing sars-cov-2 infectionsanother immunogenic target the rbd which lies along the s protein is usually the target of many neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov 30 a substantial level of cross-reactivity by sars-cov rbd-induced antibodies to sars-cov-2 rbd was described table 1 20 of clinical relevance these antibodies were also able to cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 pseudovirus infection signifying the potential of an immunotherapy-based treatment 20 while one non-peer reviewed study has shown that rbd-based serological assays are more sensitive than s1 subunit-based assays in identifying antibodies in mild covid-19 patients 14 other non-peer-reviewed studies have described a lower degree of antibody response to the rbd as compared to full-length s protein plausibly reflecting the larger number of epitopes present on the larger s antigen 13 19due to a high level of similarity of 90 between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 n proteins the n antigen of sars-cov was also used for serological detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibodies table 1 14 these n-based assays were reported to be more sensitive than s1 subunit-based tests 14 the use of sars-cov antigens to diagnose sars-cov-2 infections may be reliable given that sars-cov has not circulated in the human population since 2004 3 in addition an earlier report has demonstrated waning of sars-cov-specific antibodies therefore being undetectable in 91 of patient serum samples after 6 years 31since respiratory diseases are the hallmark of coronavirus infections which activate mucosal immunity several studies have exploited the detection of iga to diagnose sars-cov-2 infection in patients table 1 13 14 although a strong iga response was also detected in covid-19 patients where peak seroconversion was achieved by two weeks pio figure 2 iga-based immunoassay has been hypothesized to be less specific than igg-based elisa due to cross-reactivity with serum samples from patients infected by other coronaviruses 14with the availability of immunoassays utilizing various coronavirus structural proteins the use of more than one different antigen-based serological approach may be essential to establish a true positive sars-cov-2 infection in addition the use of saliva samples and other bodily fluid swabs as a less invasive alternative which have been done for other viral infections including hiv and measles should also be explored for serological testing of sars-cov-2 infections 32 33apart from using immunoassays for the early detection of sars-cov-2 infected individuals it is also critical to determine the regions where sars-cov-2-specific antibodies bind to help guide vaccine designs using sars-cov-derived b-cell epitopes that have been experimentally identified from positive b-cell assays 34 49 out of 298 linear b-cell epitopes have an identical match with sars-cov-2 protein sequences without any mutations 3 notably majority of these matches were located at both the s and n viral antigens with only 4 from the m protein and none in the e protein 3 on the other hand 6 conformational b-cell epitopes identified from the same database were located on the s antigen however unlike the linear epitopes none of these mapped identically to the sars-cov-2 protein 3further mapping the residues of linear b-cell epitopes onto available sars-cov s protein structure revealed several regions on the s2 subunit that may allow cross-neutralization of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3 35 in contrast conformational b-cell epitopes mapped onto the s1 subunit resulting in very few identical residues within sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3 these findings indicate that sars-cov-specific antibodies targeting these discontinuous regions may not be able to cross-react with sars-cov-2 3 36 as these regions are computationally predicted serological studies using patient samples are necessary to validate the importance of these regions for serology and in controlling sars-cov-2 infection it also remains imperative to identify other sars-cov antibodies that may recognize the conformational epitopes of sars-cov-2 s protein which can greatly reduce the amount of time needed to develop novel neutralizing antibodiesthe findings derived from serological assays can provide valuable information that would help to support the diagnosis treatment and prevention of sars-cov-2 infections characterization of antibody profiles suggested that any suspected individuals with undetectable antibody levels against sars-cov-2 after 20 days pio may be a true negative case since both anti-sars-cov-2 igm or igg seroconversion should have already occurred 10 11 however these findings may be limited to the relatively small sample size 300 patients and may require further validation with a larger cohort in order to reinforce diagnosis it would be advisable to perform multiple assays against different viral antigenin addition the information of antibody seroconversion is crucial in determining the optimal timepoints to collect serum or plasma samples for immunoassay screening as well as obtaining peripheral blood b cells for the generation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 37 currently in order to rapidly generate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov-2 repurposing of existing sars-cov-specific antibodies was demonstrated to date two human sars-cov-specific antibodies cr3022 and 47d11 have been shown to recognize sars-cov-2 38 39 cr3022 recognizes an epitope along the rbd of sars-cov-2 which differs largely at the c-terminus residues to the rbd of sars-cov 38 unfortunately this variation in sequence impacted the ability of cr3022 to cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 monoclonal antibody 47d11 on the other hand targets the rbd along the s1 subunit of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with similar affinities thereby enabling cross-neutralization against sars-cov-2 infection 39 while combinatory therapy has exhibited a stronger neutralization capability against sars-cov infection 40 a cocktail antibody approach for sars-cov-2 could be exploredsurprisingly reports on antibodies against the coronavirus e protein are scarce possibly due to it being the smallest protein however the e antigen is involved in viral assembly release of virions as well as virus pathogenesis 41 it was demonstrated that recombinant coronaviruses lacking the e protein displayed significantly reduced viral titers impaired viral maturation and produced avirulent virus progenies suggesting a similar importance of e protein during sars-cov-2 infection 42 43 thus it would be worthwhile to identify or generate neutralizing antibodies that are specific against the viral e proteinduring the course of an epidemic one of the main challenges is the identification of asymptomatic infection since these individuals do not present any distinguishable symptoms they could be the major source of transmission 10 immunoassays may be able to detect mildly infected cases 14 which is important to ascertain the extent of community spreadwhile it is fast robust and easy to perform there are several limitations to serological assays one of the major setbacks of immunoassays is the inability to detect the presence of infection during the early stage of disease as antibodies take several days to be generated after exposure to foreign material 44 as such a recent infection may provide false negative results during serological testing thus the use of rt-pcr may be more suitable to diagnose an early acute sars-cov-2 infection furthermore due to the unique genetic makeup of each individual there would be an inherent variability of the antibody response 45 this could possibly explain the difference in antibody profiles elicited among individuals infected with sars-cov-2 10cross-reactivity could potentially be a limitation of immunoassays as it severely impacts the specificity and sensitivity of the test although the phylogenetically closest coronavirus sars-cov has not been reported to be circulating in the human population since 2004 3 other endemic human coronaviruses may still pose a problem to accurately diagnose patients with true sars-cov-2 infection while a recent study has demonstrated negligible cross-reactivity from human coronavirus nl63 to sars-cov-2 13 validation with other human coronaviruses remains to be investigated in addition prior findings on the s protein sequence and neutralization antigenicity of other coronaviruses suggest that antibodies neutralizing clinical human coronavirus isolates may not have the same degree of cross-reactivity with laboratory strains of human coronaviruses thereby affecting the sensitivity of immunoassays 4648given the rapid increase in the number of confirmed covid-19 cases coupled with the shortage in test kits to meet rising demands decentralized point-of-care tests poct may be another alternative to facilitate sars-cov-2 diagnosis such tests include lateral flow assay lfa which is a paper-based platform for the detection and quantification of analytes in complex mixtures 49 to design lfa for sars-cov-2 detection an antibody specific to the viral antigen or a viral antigen that is detectable by patient serum or plasma samples can be immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane detection of binding between the analyte and capture antibody by a detector antibody will give rise to a colored line closely resembling home pregnancy kits 50 poct is advantageous as it is usually designed to be rapid sensitive highly accessible and easily performed requiring only a small amount of sample 50 meanwhile several hundreds of candidate pocts are being evaluated for their applicability toward identifying sars-cov-2-infected individuals 50 however pocts cant replace rt-pcr and it is crucial that these developing tests are rigorously assessed prior to use it is important to note that wrong use and interpretation could lead to disastrous public health consequences 51rapid development of diagnostic tools and immune-based assays are important early interventions against the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic the availability of serological assays that target a diverse range of viral antigen has no doubt assisted in the accurate diagnosis of covid-19 patients essentially data generated through serological studies can greatly aid in supplementing the results from qrt-pcr as well as contribute to seroepidemiology which has been shown to help in the design of virus elimination programs 52 moving forward this extensive collation of the current immunoassays against sars-cov-2 will provide insights toward monoclonal antibodies discovery and characterization for the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccineln and lr conceived the presented idea cl wrote the manuscript

 before the wuhan citywide shutdown specimens for confirmatory tests had to be sent to china cdc with a long turnaround time subsequently several main tertiary care hospitals in wuhan were authorized to perform the tests therefore in the earlier stages of the outbreak a very limited number of patients were tested and confirmed for the diagnosis since 25 january tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients with a history of exposure fever and positive findings on chest ct however since only a limited number of tests can be offered each day due to limited supplies and lab facilities only a portion of the targeted population received tests for example during the month of january 2020 only 1700 specimens were tested media report by the hospital on wechat 1292020 compared with the vast number of clinic patients during that period between 22 january and 30 january alone there were over 7000 visits to one of the designated fever clinic this created a significant backlog as many patients had to wait for days to receive a confirmation or exclusion of diagnosis it also led to problems in realtime reporting causing artificial fluctuation in daily updates of new cases figure 2b for example as shown in table 1 using data collected from the national health commissions daily updates
7
 on some dates the change in the number of newly confirmed cases varies drastically this cannot be explained by realistic changes in the speed of infection spread needless to say the recorded figures of daily confirmed cases are likely underestimatedanother concern related to the nucleic acid tests is that there has not been sufficient time to assess their sensitivity and specificity based on personal communications with colleagues a significant portion of patients who otherwise fit the diagnosis based on clinical and chest ct findings including many hospitalized patients have tested negative for viral rna other common respiratory etiologies such as influenza were excluded these remain suspected cases and may be reflective of false negativity in sampling in some patients the virus may be present in the lower respiratory secretion but absent in the upper respiratory tractswith the current tests it is therefore difficult to achieve a meaningful assessment of what proportion of symptomatic patients are infecteddata from the sars epidemic show that serological responses including viralspecific immunoglobulin m igm and igg can allow for serologic diagnosis

 most recently it was shown that patients with 2019ncov pneumonia also possessed similar acute serological responses

 using the bat sarsr111 cov rp3 nucleocapsid protein np as an antigen both igg and igm antibodies could be detected with enzymelinked immunoassay elisa in these patients the dynamic pattern is consistent with an acute viral infection with the igg concentration beginning to rise as igm levels start to drop
4

as we know the production of host antibodies to a specific virus during an acute phase infection is consistent in most patients except for those with immunodeficiency the igm antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections the requirement for specimen quality is less stringent than for rnabased assays whether viruses themselves are present in respiratory specimens the presence of a specific antibody can be uniformly detected avoiding falsenegative results due to sampling most importantly with the regular 96well microplate and automatic elisa devices the test capacity is greatly increased compared to rnabased molecular tests and can handle a large number of febrile patients such as in the current epidemic with a quick turnaround time 23 hours for example hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantavirus was endemic in hubei province with a high annual incidence in the 1980s and 1990s the rapid and specific etiologic diagnosis was critical for patient management and epidemic controls an igmcapture elisa was used to quickly screen all febrile patients effectively during those epidemic seasons
10
 
11
 similarly for the novel coronavirus pneumonia ncvp situation an igmcapture elisa can offer earlier and more efficient confirmation or exclusion of the ncov2019 infection in patients with fever thus adding to the accuracy of epidemiologic monitoring and facilitating proper isolation of patientsfrom a technical point of view although the np can serve as a sensitive antigen other 2019ncovspecific epitopes or antigens should be explored for use in the serology assay it has been reported that the n protein of sars cov antigenically crossreacted with antisera of antigenic groupi animal coronaviruses such as human coronavirus 229e feline infectious peritonitis virus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc404591 therefore the use of the whole n protein as the antigen for serological assay could lead to specificity and sensitivity issues potentiallyduring this current outbreak one of the authors volunteered in one of the designated fever clinics the scene was astonishing with over a thousand of anxious patients with illnesses ranging from mild to severe all lined up and waiting over 4 hours to be seen the vast majority could be individuals without infection by ncov2019 yet all the protection they had was facial masks one cannot imagine how much risk for cross infection can occur in such overcrowded situations if some rapid viral diagnostic tests were available the situation would be completely different patients could quickly have blood drawn when they first arrive and wait elsewhere to receive the results or they could have blood drawn in their own communities common residential areas called xiao qu in wuhan as in most other cities to avoid a trip to the clinics and high potential for ncov2019 exposure coincident with the 2019ncov outbreak is the season for several other common respiratory etiologies such as influenza and the common cold after the citywide shutdown and heightened public warning there was a surge of clinic patients many patients would visit several clinics or the same clinic daily trying to be selected for rna tests a significant number of them had symptoms or lab findings that are not consistent with ncvp such as elevated lymphocytes and lack of chest ct findings with a serological test these patients could avoid the clinic visitscurrently rnabased molecular tests require upscale lab facilities with restrictive biosafety levels and technical sophistication and expensive the screening patient population is in both large medical centers or smaller communitylevel hospitals serologic tests can be easily implemented in the clinical laboratory of any hospital thus with a much wider application than molecular testsanother issue for consideration is reporting of asymptomatically infected cases or very mild cases of infection who are a large group of patients but not tested for viral rna which is impractical therefore making the true rate of infection in the population unknown with the development of a specific igg antibody test a largescale seroepidemiological study can be conducted after the end of the current outbreak so that we can understand the true scale of humantohuman transmission of the novel coronavirus of 2019a fastperforming serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and future outbreaksthe authors declare that there are no conflict of intereststhe novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in late 2019 to cause coronavirus disease covid-19 the rapid global spread and exponential growth of the pandemic wave have stretched the limits of the available healthcare and intensive care unit capacity since the initial notification of an outbreak on december 31st the global response has transitioned from the initial policy of active case finding and containment to an increasingly complex package of confinement measures including closures of schools implementation of travel restrictions and physical distancing measures at present given the global circulation of sars-cov-2 the consensus is that elimination of the virus is no longer feasible and that longer-term strategies are needed that strike a balance between the economically and socially damaging near lockdown approaches and full release of any control measures there is wide agreement that in the latter situation rapid resurgence would be very likely with modeled epidemic peaks potentially exceeding the current healthcare capacity1the so-called exit strategy is defined as the transition from the current approach which focuses entirely on flattening the peak of the covid-19 emergence curve to the transition phase in which restrictions are gradually lifted the gradual lifting of control measures will require active surveillance to allow early detection of new cases or clusters coupled with contact tracing and quarantine most likely combined with continued physical distancing recommendations and enhanced protection of those at-risk from most severe disease a key knowledge gap is the level and duration of protective immunity in the population at large and in specific groups including persons with different clinical severity12to assess the extent of virus circulation in the community and the likelihood of protection against a re-infection there is a crucial need to add serology to the testing algorithms the required performance of a serological assay will depend on the specific aim of testing which may be either population screening in the general population or at-risk populations or diagnostic support we recently showed that antibodies directed against the s1 subunit of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and specifically to the receptor binding domain rbd within the s1 subunit strongly correlate with virus neutralization3 the likelihood of predicting protective antibody responses will thus increase when using either s1 antigens or rbd in the assay the specificity of serological tools detecting antibodies against sars cov-2 might be hampered by the presence of antibodies against other circulating coronaviruses in the population and thus testing for cross reactivity is crucial when selecting an appropriate assay for a specific purpose decision making should include the available knowledge on antibody specificities kinetics and functions4 the limited knowledge on antibody kinetics in emerging virus infections is always a challenge for design and validation of serological assays during an outbreak recent studies in covid-19 patients have shown that in both hospitalized patients and patients with mild disease seroconversion rates reach 100 after 1014 days and that antibody levels may correlate with clinical severity235 this is in line with observations in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection in which antibody responses varied depending on disease severity with mild and asymptomatic infections resulting in weaker immune responses6 therefore for meaningful interpretation of serological assays and extrapolation of results to population screening sufficient samples from persons with mild and asymptomatic disease should be included in validation studiesin our study we compare three platforms which are widely used in diagnostic laboratories three rapid tests four elisas and a high throughput chemiluminescent assay clia which can be used to address different needs for individualized home testing as supplement to diagnostics and in population screening we analyze their performance in correlation to an in-house virus neutralization assay3 which is currently the gold standard when assessing protective immunity against sars cov-2serological testing to support clinical diagnostic work-up is mostly requested in hospitalized patients this can be for example when sars cov-2 rna diagnostic testing remains negative in a patient despite a strong clinical suspicion or for patients whose samples during the symptomatic phase were not collected other patients in whom antibody testing can be very valuable are those who have been hospitalized for weeks and in whom a pcr test continues to be positive with increasing cycle threshold values in these patients the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies can help with the decision to stop using personal protective equipment in these patients usually the serological results are interpreted by laboratory staff and there is a possibility to test follow-up sera or perform confirmation serological testing when comparing the laboratory assays in patients with different severity and stages of disease overall and in patients tested more than 14 days post-onset of disease the rbd antigen based wantai total ig assay performed best fig 1 table 1 both igg assays targeting the s antigen euroimmun and liaison lacked sensitivity in hospitalized patients as the sample set included early time-points the s1 based iga assay by euroimmun in contrast had a good sensitivity and showed the best quantitative relationship specifically once neutralizing titers were higher than 80 prnt50 units upon which the rbd ig assay becomes non-linear iga testing will detect both early and memory iga responses and will thus be a useful addition to igg assays the possible relevance of quantitative antibody measurements will need to be assessed when results of longer-term patient follow-up studies become available an alternative of the prnt50 can be the use of a surrogate virus neutralization test for sars cov-2 as recently produced by genscript usa which allows direct quantification extensive studies on the performance have however not yet been publisheddespite the differences in sensitivity all laboratory assays had sufficient positive predictive value ppv in covid-19 hospitalized patients when assuming an expected seroprevalence in this population of 50 table 1 or when using serology as an adjunct to rt-pcr testing to monitor the clinical course of illness their application as sole diagnostic howeverfor instance in primary care where the seroprevalence will be much lowerwill be more challenging as illustrated by the variation in ppv of the assays with a seroprevalence estimate of 4 which is the level currently observed in the netherlands7in addition to specialized elisa assays used in laboratory settings a wide range of rapid diagnostic tests rdt has been put on the market triggering the question whether they can be used in patient care or for triage in a medical care facility we selected three rdts by following criteria 1 preferably targetting the spike of sars-cov-2 2 at least european conformity ce marking or other authorization and 3 sufficient production capacity the rdts provide qualitative yesno results which does not allow quantification or the definition of a cut-off for neutralization fig 1fh all three rdts had a sufficient ppv in high seroprevalence scenarios which implies that there might be a role for the rdts when used for the individual patient with a sufficiently high pretest probability as an add on to pcr based diagnostics the high negative predictive value npv of the rdts in a low seroprevalence scenario could offer opportunities for the use of the test in the general population if the aim is to rule out the presence of sars cov-2 antibodies table 1population screening during a pandemic phase requires a highly specific assay to assure an acceptable ppv in populations with a low sero-prevalence3 and additionally a reasonable sensitivity table 1 this condition was met for the wantai elisas and euroimmun igg elisa the euroimmun iga and liaison  clia analyzer performed less well with specificities 95 when testing serum samples from persons exposed to a range of viruses table 18 this led to very low ppvs of respectively 39 and 26 for the euroimmun iga and the clia analyzer in low prevalence settings while the wantai total ig continued to perform reasonably well tested specimen were obtained from patients with mild moderate and severe disease all patients had detectable antibodies by prnt50 from day 18 supplementary data the severity of disease did not affect the range of detected neutralizing titers or sensitivity of selected assays table 1 supplementary data due to limitations in sample volumes of mild patients these were not equally tested in all assays in addition future studies are recommended to address the performance of alternative high throughput assays like the roche elecsys anti-sars-cov-2 or abbott sars-cov-2 igg in correlation to neutralizationfor the rdts the specificities varied from 85 to 99 table 1 although  the overall performance of the cellex assay with 99 specificity was hampered by its low sensitivity of 80 generally the use of the selected rdt is not recommended in population screening where estimated seroprevalence is mostly 5 and the ppv will be too low for a reliable interpretation table 1 a final question in population screening is whether the antibody measurements correlate with functional antibodies that can protect a population during a subsequent exposure in our analyses samples testing positive in the wantai ig elisa with an od ratio  10 all had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies which suggests thatusing a cut-off- in this assay could be used to indicate presence of neutralizing antibodies the exact kinetics and functionality of these antibodies in offering protection remains to be determinedin conclusion our presented data support decision making for the use of serology in either individual patient care or population-level serological testing we conclude that for the aim of detecting protective antibodies the rbd based wantai elisa had the best overall performance including the potential to set a cut-off indicating the presence of protective antibodies the global performance of the selected rdts is not robust enough for over the counter personalized testing in the populationall specimen used in the study have been collected and delivered to our diagnostic laboratory for patient diagnostics and not following a predefined covid-19 research protocol to determine specificity of the assays we used a well-defined panel of 147 serum and plasma samples from 147 individuals exposed to human coronaviruses hcov-229e nl63 or oc43 sars mers or with a range of other respiratory viruses adenovirus human metapneumovirus influenza ab rsv ab rhinovirus bocavirus parainfluenzavirus 1 and 3 enterovirus specimen from patients with recent cytomegalovirus cmv epstein barr virus ebv or m pneumoniae infection were included as these have a high likelihood of causing cross reactivity sera were collected from 23 weeks upon the respiratory infection and during the acute phase of cmv or ebv the variation in the number of samples tested per assay was caused by limited sample volume and by the limited  availability of rdts during the study periodsensitivity was calculated by using a total of 187 sera from 107 individuals in the netherlands in whom covid-19 was confirmed by rt-pcr and antibodies were detected by prnt50 disease severity varied from 1 mild non-hospitalized 2 moderate hospitalized and 3 severe admitted to the intensive care unit specimen were taken at different time-points post-onset of disease supplementary data fig 1 all specimen were stored at 20 c until use the variation in the number of samples tested per assay is caused by the fact that validation was part of the acute diagnostic response during the first phase of the covid-19 pandemic initially a set of 75 patient sera was tested in all assays these sera were mostly collected from hospitalized patients and involved only three sera from mild patients to assess the performance of the assays in population screening it is important to involve sera from mild patients so we increased the number of tested sera in the wantai elisas liaison and rdts the selection of these assays was based on the best overall performance of wantai elisas in the first analyses and the likely application of liaison and rdts in population screening the exact number of specimen tested per assay varied due to availability of serum figure 1 depicts the outcome of the assays per time interval analyses in mild patients are shown in table 1 source data can be found in the supplementary data 1the use of specimen was approved by the erasmus mc medical ethical committee mec approval 2014414 which allows the use of clinical data and left-over material from the specimen delivered to our laboratory for diagnostics unless patients have declared they opted out of this scheme in addition the erasmus mc institutional research committee regulated that all covid-19 patients admitted to erasmus mc are asked for permission to use their clinical data and left-over patient material for covid-19 research purposes all patients who refused have been excluded from the

hospitalized patientsfurther information on research design is available in the nature research reporting summary linked to this articlethe recent development of the coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 had caused a global pandemic with significant impact on healthcare system similar to the acute infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the infection with the sars-cov-2 causative agent of covid-19 is associated with asymptomatic infection 1 testing for mers-cov and sars-cov-2 is currently dependent on molecular testing rt-pcr there were multiple generation of molecular tests that were developed over the proceeding few months in an effort to improve the sensitivity and specificity however there is a global shortage of molecular tests for sars-cov-2 with expanding scope of testing in many countries to identify cases for the isolation and application of quarantine measures for serologic diagnosis of mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections the identifications of antibodies require both acute and convalescent serum sampling this is particularly important as we witness an increased number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic covid-19 infections it is understandable that such serologic tests are not performed routinely to diagnose respiratory viral infections however it is not known if asymptomatic individuals are able to mount an antibody response serologic testing enables us to understand the extent of the tip of the iceberg death rate as we detect more asymptomatic individualsserologic testing enables policy makers to make informed scientific decisions regarding the resumption of usual life and lifting social distancing and lockdown of cities especially if we have the 5060 seroprevalence which is taken as a signal of herd immunityserologic tests will enable the healthcare community to understand the extent of the infection as well as be an important tool to identify those who are already immune such as healthcare workers identification of immune hcws would allow those to go back to work in addition serology would be particularly important to assess the effectiveness of any vaccinesthe development of serologic tests requires better understanding of the sars-cov-2 structure and the immunologic response to the virus the most appealing site for such antibodies is the spike s protein of the sars-cov-2 however there are multiple parts of the s-protein and it is not clear which part of this protein offers the best site for antibody development 2 it is also important to make sure that these antibody tests are unique and do not cross react with the widely distributed common cold coronaviruses or mers-cov in areas of its endemicity one study of three patients showed cross-reactivity with the sars-cov s and s1 proteins and to a lower extent with mers-cov s protein but not with the mers-cov s1 protein 3 an excellent serologic test would be 100 sensitive and 100 specific especially for measuring sars-cov-2 s and rdb iga igg and igm antibodieshaving a helpful serology requires that we know that such antibodies are specific confirm a long immunity and know how these antibodies protect against infection to avoid the false sense of security in relation to infection an additional area of concern is the need to have a diagnostic stewardship as these tests will not be helpful in the diagnosis of acute covid-19 infection an early study of sars-cov-2 patients showed the presence of igm antibodies in 50 816 and in 81 1316 and that igg antibodies were detected in 81 1316 and 100 1616 of patients over time 4 and igm was detected in other studied patients 5 the seroconversion was said to occur in 2 weeks in one study 3 the s1 igg and iga elisas had lower specificity with variable sensitivity and that iga elisa had higher sensitivity 3in a study of contacts of a patient with mild symptoms evaluation of igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence assays ifa based on vero e6 cells in the index patient igg and igm were undetectable on day 4 after onset of symptoms however igg titers were 80 and 1280 and those of igm were 80 and 320 on days 9 and 20 respectively 6 none of the 19 healthcare contacts were positive 6 in the case of sars-cov the detection of antibodies was possible on days 342 for igm and on days 547 for igg 7there are few studies addressing serology to different sars-cov-2 antigens one study of three patients antibodies were detected against s1 subunit and rbd and only two patients had detectable antibodies to the n-terminal s1a domain 3 serologic testing may also facilitate the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection in families one study showed a family cluster of covid-19 among 5 of 6 members by serology vs 2 members based on pcr testing 8looking back at the lessons we learned from the mers-cov serology we could deduce few similarities and differences with sars-cov-2 in family contacts of mers-cov cases serologic analysis showed that of 280 contacts 19 67 had positive recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay relisa s1 6 21 had positive recombinant immunofluorescence assay rrifa full s and only 4 14 had positive plaque-reduction neutralization testing prn 8 however a follow up samples 26 months later showed serologic positivity among 44 samples of 5 114 2 45 and 1 23 using relisa rrifa and prn respectively 9 this study showed the following subclinical transmission in the families a minority of contacts had positive serology and a fraction had persistent antibodies months after infection currently we do not have studies of sars-cov-2 serology extending overtime to document the persistence of these antibodiesan area where serology would be beneficial is surveillance and this is an awaited step to understand the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 infection however for mers-cov there was a nation-wide serosurviellance study in saudi arabia that study examined the serologic response in 10009 individuals and showed that anti-mers-cov antibodies were confirmed in 15 015 95 ci 009024 10 there is a large variation in the diagnostic capabilities of different serologic assays in different laboratories and it was recommended that laboratories use a testing algorithm including 2 tests to ensure correct diagnosis of mers-cov 11 in addition mers-cov s1 protein-based elisa was used for surveillance studies and was found to have a low sensitivity in detecting infection in pcr-confirmed patients with mild clinical symptoms 12 although patients with mild mers-cov infection as detected by pcr tests had seroconversion not all of them had detectable levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies 12 this may indicates that the presence of anti-mers-cov antibodies might not indicate immunitythus currently the evidence for the use of serologic testing of sars-cov-2 is not optimal these tests are subject to variability in sensitivity and specificity differences in the timing of the appearance of antibodies and whether these antibodies confirm protection is not known this is particularly important when making decisions about hcws who might be at risk of contracting sars-cov-2the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 has rapidly spread with globally over 37 million confirmed cases and over 259000 total deaths as of may 5 2020 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 the cause of covid-19 is highly contagious and can result in significant mortality among susceptible individuals with comorbidities acute symptoms and signs of sars-cov-2 infection are highly nonspecific and include fever cough fatigue myalgia and dyspnea with some patients progressing to pneumonia 2 3 4 however some other individuals are asymptomatic carriers 5 6 7 these characteristics of the disease create an urgent need to develop serological tests to identify asymptomatic silent infections evaluate patient immune response better predict disease progression and improve our understanding of the epidemiology including transmission patterns of sars-cov-2 serological testing could also play an important role for de-isolation procedures 8 and implementation of convalescent plasma therapy for ill covid-19 patients 9 10throughout the covid pandemic a wide variety of serological tests have entered the global market including but not limited to colloidal gold immunochromatographic assays magnetic chemiluminescent immunoassays enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa and rapid test cassettes and dipsticks 4 11 12 due to the growing public health emergency and in an effort to facilitate rapid expansion of testing capacity the united states food and drug administration fda issued a policy on mid-march 2020 13 and a revised policy in early may 14 allowing for the development of covid-19 diagnostic testing in the clinical health care and commercial settings through the emergency use authorization eua program over 100 manufacturers have notified the fda that they are offering or plan to offer serological tests in the united states but as yet only 12 assays have received eua clearance 15 furthermore there has been a lack of rigorous validation and performance evaluation of the available serological assays in covid-19 negative and positive populations as well as a lack of thorough comparison between different serological testing platforms such data are urgently needed to evaluate the clinical utility and also the limitations of serological tests as there has been significant controversy over the diagnostic and prognostic value of antibody testing in addition the potential role of serological antibody testing in epidemiological studies and in the accurate identification of convalescent plasma donors for

cefa and mia had detection rates of 262 95ci 153-411 and 263 95ci 150-42 respectively p005 when patients first presented to the ed and tested covid-19 positive by rt-pcr number of days since any symptom onset mean65 95ci 518-7732longitudinal change of igm and igg in the hospitalized patients
we investigated 42 ed patients 120 samples by cefa and 114 samples by mia in which 28 patients 106 samples by cefa and 100 samples by mia were subsequently admitted the detection rates of igm igg or both at different times after symptom onset are shown in table 3
 only 25 cefa 95 ci 44-591 and 143 mia 95 ci 07-513 of the samples in early phase 0-3 days after symptom onset were antibody positive however the detection rate increased to 690 cefa 95 ci538-809 and 650 mia 95 ci 495-779 during days 8-14 933 95 ci702-997 during days 15-20 and finally reached 100 cefa 95 ci 845-1000 mia 95 ci 832-1000 in samples that were obtained more than 21 days after symptom onset the sensitivities of the two methods were not significantly different during any time framethe plot of index values log10 scale and a simulated trending curve of igmigg and total antibody are shown in figures 2
a and b respectively overall igm cefa figure 2a reached peak levels between days 10 and 20 after symptom onset and declined afterwards igg cefa figure 2a and total antibody mia figure 2b reached a peak in a similar time frame as igm but then plateaued the comparison of the slope utilizing the gee method revealed the rate of change of igm iv log10 scale is significantly slower than that of igg p  00001 figure 2c the changing rate of total antibody is shown in figure 2dlongitudinal changes of normalized index value log10 scale measured by the cefa assay igg and igm and the mia method total antibodies were plotted in the 28 inpatients including 18 patients on ventilators figure 3
a and 10 patients not on ventilators figure 3b overall the changing trend of antibody levels correlated well between the cefa and mia measurements all patients on ventilators and 5 patients not on ventilators had a significant increase in antibody levels during their disease course among them the igg and total antibody levels in 10 patients reached to a plateau around day 15-20 post-symptom onset igm levels in 5 patients started declining 16  21 days post-symptom onset three types of seroconversion were observed synchronous seroconversion of igg and igm 17 patients igm seroconversion earlier than that of igg 1 patient and igg seroconversion earlier than that of igm 5 patientsfive patients discharged less than 14 days after admission did not have detectable antibody levels thus it is unclear if these patients had sufficient time to develop an antibody responsefurther analysis suggests that changes in igm igg and total antibody levels over time are not significantly different between the ventilator and non-ventilator groups in our dataset p  030 for igm p  084 for igg p  01 for total antibodya total of 144 samples from convalescent patients who tested positive by sars-cov-2 rt-pcr or had covid-19 exposure or symptoms were tested by both cefa and mia methods which showed large variations of antibody levels in convalescent sera the distribution of igg index values and total antibody index values among 75 positive samples by both methods are shown in figure 4
a and b respectivelythis study serves as an important example of a collaborative effort between an academic clinical laboratory and state government agency this study sheds light on the performance and potential clinical utility of two sars-cov-2 antibody testing methodologies during the covid-19 outbreak in new york cityoverall both cefa and mia assays demonstrated excellent analytical performance in their independent validations as well as concordance in ed inpatient and convalescent samples while the result reporting differs between the two assays where one detects igm and igg separately and the other targets total antibody we found that the detection rate at any given time period post-symptom onset did not differ significantly with both assays demonstrating sensitivities  25 when tested 7 days after symptoms began reaching 100  21 days after symptom onset these results are consistent with previous studies 17 evaluating recombinant immunofluorescence or chemiluminescent immunoassays 18 19 in contrast rt-pcr testing demonstrates its highest level of sensitivity during the first week of symptoms and then gradually declines in the next few weeks 20 21 we demonstrate that serological testing has limited diagnostic value in screening symptomatic patients during their first ed visit as reporting of symptom onset in ed patients is subject to recall bias a variation in time to antibody detection was observed with most rt-pcr sars-cov-2 positive patients demonstrating detectable antibody levels 3 -7 days post hospital admission therefore if there is high clinical suspicion of covid-19 in patients negative by rt-pcr repeated or serial monitoring of serum antibodies may be helpful in confirming disease status and prudent to achieve optimal sensitivity in combination with rt-pcrboth methods demonstrated high specificity which is critical for evaluating hospitalized patients and understanding of the epidemiology neither cefa nor mia showed the cross-reactivity in the samples from other coronavirus infected patients the limitation was the relatively small sample size due to the limited access and future larger studies are warranted to further examine the assay cross-reactivity in addition while the cefa and mia assays exhibited overall excellent agreement with kappa 081 a small proportion of samples disagreed a possible explanation for the disagreement was the difference in the underlying principle of the assays the antigens for the cefa method is the s protein rbd and np targeting igm and igg in separate assays the antigen for the mia method is the np targeting total antibodies currently it is unknown which assay is more correlated with protected role of antibody which warrant future studiesthe kinetic change of antibody levels was consistent between the two methodologies all mechanically ventilated patients displayed an increase in igm and igg levels during the course of their hospitalization three types of seroconversion were observed interesting 74 patients in our study showed synchronous seroconversion 5 showed igg prior to igm whereas only 1 out of 23 patients had igm seroconversion earlier than igg these patterns of seroconversion are similar to a previous report showing that the majority of patients 731 had either synchronous seroconversion or igg seroconversion earlier than igm 22 however due to the nature of this study serum specimens of most patients could not be collected on a daily basis at the later stages of illness or post-recovery therefore a complete dynamic pattern of antibody levels could not be studied and thus the full time course of the antibody response remains unknown in these patients a more thorough investigation is needed to monitor the kinetic change of antibody levels over an extended period of time including convalescenceprior studies reported most individuals infected with sars-cov-1 mounted an antibody response 23 24 25 whereas mers-cov infected patients with mild or asymptomatic infections exhibited varied immune responses which at times were undetectable by antibody assays 26 27 while there is growing data on the antibody response to sars-cov-2 infection 18 28 29 the level and duration of the anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic covid-19 patients is still uncertain in the present dataset all 18 patients in the mechanically ventilated group seroconverted this is in contrast to 5 cefa and 4 mia out of 10 patients in the non-ventilated group who had undetectable igm and igg levels during their hospital stay four patients were discharged  10 days post-symptom onset and 1 patient had undetectable antibodies when discharged on day 13 after symptom onset thus this retrospective study cannot provide additional data on these patients however the perceived suboptimal antibody responses is likely due to short hospitalizations resulting in the lack of specimen for analysis during the intermediate and late stages of the disease more specimens from mildly ill patients will need to be collected for longer time periods in order to better understand patterns of sars-cov-2 immune response this information is essential to discussions regarding reentry into the workforce by asymptomatic individuals post-infectionit has been suggested that worse outcomes and increased disease severity with covid-19 may correspond with increased sars-cov-2 igg levels or a higher titer of sars-cov-2 antibodies when compared to those with less severe disease 20 30 31 although the current study found that the positivity rate of antibodies increased with time after symptom onset for both methods there was no statistical difference in antibody levels based on ventilation status assay variation may explain the lack of correlation between antibody levels and severity of disease as our methods currently are validated only for qualitative sars-cov-2 antibody analysis and its semi-quantitative use may not give the analytical resolution needed for such studies bias may also exist in that patients with milder symptoms did not present to the hospital and thus there is no comparison between this missing cohort and the cohort of hospitalized patients which displayed more severe symptoms functional assays such as neutralizing antibody assays have been proposed to evaluate the efficacy of vaccinations and due to the complicated interplay between virus and the immunologic host response 32 neutralizing antibody assays 30 may be better suited for such correlation studies furthermore this study did not extensively follow longitudinally patient antibody levels and consequently the study was likely underpowered in its ability to see this secondary outcome measure additional independent large-cohort studies would be needed to further study these previously described findingsboth the fda and cdc stress the importance of serological testing for the detection of prior infection in asymptomatic individuals and those presenting late in illness as well as identifying individuals who have mounted an immune response to sars-cov-2 33 34 our data suggest that there is a wide range of antibody levels in convalescent serum of note the distribution of antibody positivity in convalescent sera examined in this study cannot be used to determine antibody prevalence and levels in the general population as these were random samples from patients recovered from covid-19 and covid-19-like illnesses cases have been reported that convalescent plasma therapy improved the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viremia in severe covid-19 cases 10 35 further studies are needed to investigate whether igg or total antibody levels correlate with neutralizing antibody levels thereby identifying potential therapeutic serum donorsin summary we performed a thorough analytical validation and clinical evaluation of two semi-quantitative sars-cov-2 immunoassays our results demonstrated the clinical utilities of serological testing in evaluating inpatients and convalescent patients the sensitivity of the current immunoassays are not suitable for early-stage screening future studies are needed to investigate the immune response in asymptomatic and mildly ill patient population and to understand the correlation between total antibody and neutralizing antibody levelsconflict of interestzz received seed instruments and sponsored travel from et healthcarethe manufacturers did not review the article and had no input on data analysis prior to the manuscript submissionsince december 2019 the entire world is still fighting against an infection caused by a novel coronavirus designated as sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the epidemic started in china and has spread rapidly worldwide becoming a pandemic 1 before the 2009 influenza ah1n1 pandemic most european union eu member states including italy had already developed preparedness plans including planning assumptions on what can be expected during a pandemic and on how a pandemic virus might behave 2 also considering the infective risk related to the global movements of the population 3 nevertheless since the first outbreak of sars-cov-2 disease covid-19 at the end of february 2020 in northern italy the epidemic gradually spread across the country 4 as of 15 may 2020 italy has had 223096 confirmed cases and 31368 deaths 1from a clinical point of view the covid-19 syndrome is characterized by fever dry cough shortness of breath and in severe cases by acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis septic shock and finally multi-organ failure 5 sars-cov-2 is highly contagious and its main route of human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact or air droplets with a higher risk of transmission within one meter from the infected person 6 furthermore a possible fecaloral transmission has been described and feces of sars-cov-2-positive patients are potentially infectious 7health workers hws directly or indirectly exposed to actually or potentially positive sars-cov-2 patients may be themselves at an increased risk 8data regarding the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infections in hws are scarce and characterized by underlying limits 9 the proportion of infected persons is estimated to range between 41 and 389 and 51 and 57 among the hws population and the general population respectively 91011 in any case the overall estimated covid-19 incidence using epidemiologic data for denominators was higher in hws than the general population 9 working in high-risk versus general heath departments suboptimal handwashing before or after patient contact longer work hours and improper protective personal equipment ppe use were reported as risk factors for acquiring the disease 9from a clinical point of view in general hws appear to experience less severe illness and present lower mortality rates than non-hws also related to younger age and fewer comorbid conditions 9 however these data are not confirmed in italy where an elevated number of fatalities among healthcare personnel was reported 12therefore many health institutions undertook steps to establish infection prevention measures for creating a safe environment to protect both patients and hws from sars-cov-2 infection moreover international health authorities recommended screening strategies for sars-cov-2 infection in exposed or high-risk hws 131415 further during a pandemic protecting the health of hws is of paramount importance for reducing morbidity and mortality reducing transmission and maintaining the health system capacity 16 as stated by the italian ministry for health following who recommendations the rna rt-pcr assay on mucus obtained by nasopharyngeal swabs is considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection 17 indeed the broad use of serology assays for diagnostic purposes is still controversial due to suboptimal diagnostic performance while these assays may be important for epidemiological purposes 1314161819therefore to date the bestoptimal method to screen hws for sars-cov-2 infection seems still under debate and data on the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection in hws working in public hospitals are still scarce in light of this scientific background the present study aims to assess i the sars-cov-2 infection rate amongst hws in a teaching hospital in central italy and ii the diagnostic performance of sars-cov-2 serology index test in comparison with the sars-cov-2 rna pcr assay reference standard a cross-sectional study was performed in a teaching hospital in rome central italy a secondary referral center with approximately 450 beds and 1300000 services provided per year including those for both inpatients and outpatients overall the hospital accounts for 2057 hws distributed in different working categories during the pandemic the hospital was indicated as a covid-19 regional hub the study was based on retrospective data 18 march27 april 2020 of hws physicians nurses other hospital staff upon the decision of the general and health management of the hospital all components of the hospital staff were consecutively tested for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr on nasopharyngeal swabs irrespective of exposure andor symptoms at suspicion of covid-19 before the nasopharyngeal swabs the hws filled in a questionnaire containing demographical data profession working unit and exposure to sars-cov-2 infection from 7 april 2020 the whole staff were also invited to be tested for the presence of igmigg antibodies against sars-cov-2 using serology assays on venous blood samples on a voluntary basis and a substantial subset 502 adhered to this initiative hws were considered positive to sars-cov-2 infection when they tested positive to the rt-pcr reference standard sars-cov-2-positive and -negative hws were compared for clinical data and exposure to sars-cov-2 infection in the subset of hws tested by both rt-pcr and serology results of the igm and igg serology assays were compared to rt-pcr index test to assess the diagnostic performance of the serology teststhis paper was

latium a low-incidence region located in central italy the latium region has 5890401 inhabitants 22 and by 24 april 2020 a total of 4492 sars-cov-2-positive cases was registered 23 corresponding to 23 of all positive cases in italy based on these data an overall estimate of sars-cov-2 infection prevalence of 008 in the general latium population can be calculated 2223 the 23 prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection amongst the hws in our teaching hospital would thus correspond to a 34 times higher occurrence of positivity 27 this prevalence amongst hws reflects the expected higher job-related-risk of infection 8 further due to the viruss characteristics of contagiousness and route of transmission hws providing for medical and sanitary care of sars-cov-2-infected patients are directly or indirectly exposed to infection and are themselves at higher risk of being infected notwithstanding accurate hygiene and personal protective devices 16 nevertheless compared with a national rate of 107 of sars-infected hws 12 in our teaching hospital identified as one of the covid reference facilities in the latium region the rate of infected hws was more than three times lower thus suggesting an effective and timely strategy to limit the spread of sars-cov infection indeed according to the guidelines provided by the national institute of health 24 in our hospital prevention protocols were timely implemented strict hygiene rule for hand washing before and after all patients interactions contact with potentially infectious sources and before putting on and after removal of personal protective equipment wearing of personal protective equipment for all hws typically composed by surgical face mask and white cotton gown or white or green dresses hairnet goggles gloves surgical mask and disposable gown in the case of low-risk patients and hairnet googles or face-shield ffp2-3 mask water-resistant gown with long sleeves and two pairs of gloves second one covering the wrist of gown sleeves in the case of high-risk or nasopharyngeal swabs positive patients measurement of body temperature at the hospital entry subjects with body temperature over 375 c were not allowed to enter in the building different ways for clean and dirty material separate doors for entry and exit accurate patients hand hygiene etc these data are further confirmed by the fact that only 29 50 of the 58 sars-cov-2-infected hws declared to have had an exposition to infected patients inside the hospital thus probably further reducing the rate of hospital-related infections the effectiveness of prevention measures in reducing the spread of infection to hws has been demonstrated in other studies that reported a zero rate of hws being infected also after performing high-risk procedures 25in the vast majority sars-cov-2-positive hws had a mild course of infection 67 the remaining percentage showed no symptoms at all in any case none had a fatal outcome or severe pneumonia in the non-symptomatic hws sars-cov-2 infection was diagnosed only thanks to the proactive screening strategy performed in all hws this infection prevention strategy might have further contributed to limit the spread of infection amongst hws but also amongst patients leading to a timely diagnosis and subsequent safety measures in these hws unaware of being infected paucisymptomatic or symptomless carriers of infection play a crucial role in spreading the infection further in the uk a screening program on asymptomatic hws in a teaching hospital swabbed and tested by rt-pcr was carried out and 3 tested positive for sars-cov-2 infection 26 thus keeping in step with our results on the other hand a study on sars-cov-2 testing in hws found a symptoms-related performance of diagnosis by rt-pcr 27 therefore great attention must be paid to which symptoms should be taken into account for building the screening decisional algorithm taken together these data suggest that proactive molecular screening strategies including asymptomatic as well as symptomatic hws should be a priority at the national and international levels the all-testing strategy in our healthcare facility likely had another indirect positive implication on hws concerning psychological distress during the pandemic 28 which is increasing and at risk of leading to hw burnout 29 further if not specifically assessed in this study getting tested and thus obtaining certainty about the proper infection status might contribute to reducing the psychological burden and fear of being infected of hws during the pandemicin our study the sars-cov-2-positive hws were younger than the negatives with half of them being younger than 40 years of age this result is not consistent with other studies that found no association between age and sars-cov-1 9 while concerning sars-cov-2 a very recent chinese study reported a 19 higher occurrence of sars-cov-positivity in hws younger than 45 years of age compared with over 45 years thus supporting our finding 30 our results might be explained by less work experience due to the younger age as also supported by the shorter duration of employment of positive compared with negative hws concerning sars-cov serology the overall igg seroprevalence was low 07 when compared with the infection rate detected by the molecular rt-pcr assay 27 a german study performed in a tertiary referral hospital described in hws stratified for confirmed suspected or no infection exposure a seroprevalence of 16 but the staff were not systematically tested by rt-pcr 31 moreover our study further showed that the diagnostic performance of sars-cov-igg serology is time-dependent sensibly increasing when performed after at least two weeks from an rt-pcr documented positivity sensitivity increased from 50 when calculated irrespective of the time interval between rt-pcr and serology to 80 after 14 days and to 100 after 20 days of rt-prc these data seem consistent with the results obtained in another study performed with a chemiluminescent assay different from that used in our study it showed an 887 sensitivity at 7 days and a 100 sensitivity at 14 and 17 days after pcr positivity with specificity values of 99 32 one further study using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay mclia for virus-specific antibody detection showed that within 19 days after the onset of symptoms 100 of patients tested positive for igg anti-sars-cov-2 supporting our results however in this study seroconversion for igg and igm occurred almost simultaneously and approximately 2022 days after symptom onset 94 of patients showed positivity to virus-specific igm antibodies 33 on the contrary in our experience the diagnostic performance of igm serology was lower than igg showing 0 of sensitivity at 99 specificity as none of the rt-pcr-positive subjects showed an igm seroconversionthese data taken together confirm the likely ideal window of two weeks for the broad seroconversion and clear detectability of anti-sars-cov-2 igg antibodies while factors influencing the seroconversion of igm antibodies are less clear with igm detectability being also assay-dependent 19 therefore igm serology does not always appear useful for diagnostic purposes of active sars-cov-2 infection while igg serology has been suggested to be used for three purposes in the sars-cov-2 pandemic 1 to diagnose infection in a limited niche of patients 2 to identify convalescent plasma donors and 3 to screen populations with the purpose to determine exposure and immunity 34 however after much clamor generated around serologic assays there is still a need for data to support their clinical utility to avoid to misdiagnose and misinform 34 finally it should be noted that the available serologic assays are very different in their format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays chemiluminescent immunoassays lateral flow immunoassays virus neutralization assays in the detected antibody class iga igm igg or pools in the used sars-cov-2 antigens for example the recombinant nucleocapsid protein the subunit 1 of the spike glycoprotein or the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain and in the specimen on which the assay is performed plasma serum whole blood finger stick 35363738 high-quality serological assays are now becoming available which need to be strategically applied deployed and validated to implement their use for diagnostic therapeutical and epidemiological purposeswe are aware of some limits of the study this was a single-center study conducted in central italy probably not able to reflect the spread of infection in hws throughout the whole country to minimize the effects of this limit for the comparison of the infection rate of hws with the general population only the estimated data of the latium region in the middle of april were taken into consideration moreover due to organizational reasons the nasopharyngeal swabs for sars-cov-2 infection were performed over a time frame of 40 days therefore we are not able to exclude that hws who tested negative at the beginning of the study might have become positive over time however during this period the other prevention measures such as body temperature measurement would probably have allowed ascertaining these cases however we did not analyze the extent to which the control measures were accomplished further only half of the hws joined the serology screening for the detection of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies thus reducing the sample number for the statistical computationsour experience in central italy demonstrated a low prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection amongst hws but higher than in the general population nearly half of the positive hws reported no previous exposure to sars-cov-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy put in place igg serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing sars-cov-2-positive at the rna rt-pcr assay by a nasopharyngeal swab igm serology seems not to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active sars-cov-2 infection high awareness of sars-cov-2 infection is mandatory for all people but especially for hws irrespective of symptoms to safeguard their health and that of patients the coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread globally mainly via person-to-person transmission and poses a major public health concern 1 the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of symptomatic covid-19 patients have been increasingly reported in recent research 2 whereas the asymptomatic proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2-infected individuals remains largely uncharacterizedsymptomatic patients are detected because they seek medical attention but asymptomatic individuals with sars-cov-2 infection are identified via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 3 a previous study investigated a familial cluster of covid-19 cases that included an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy who had radiological ground-glass lung opacities and tested positive on the rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 1 a case report identified a 61-year-old asymptomatic patient with abnormal ct images and positive rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 that persisted for 23 days in the absence of obvious clinical symptoms 4 while some asymptomatic infected individuals remain asymptomatic over a long period a proportion of asymptomatic covid-19 patients were identified at the presymptomatic stage through epidemiological investigation a study identified 24 sars-cov-2 positive cases on rt-pcr comprising five cases that subsequently developed covid-19 symptoms and 19 that remained asymptomatic 5 in addition a study screened pregnant women who presented at hospitals and identified 43 covid-19 patients via nucleic acid tests including four patients who remained afebrile and asymptomatic throughout their delivery hospitalization and postpartum course 6 the abovementioned studies identified asymptomatic covid-19 patients via rt-pcr tests but the viral shedding pattern and epidemiologic characteristics of covid-19 remain poorly understoodasymptomatic patients can easily be overlooked in epidemic prevention 7 8 based on data extracted from chinas infectious disease information system 889 asymptomatic cases were identified among the 72314 patient records which accounted for only 12 of the total patients 9 recent rt-pcr tests in china that primarily provided for passengers arriving from abroad revealed that 78 of the cases of new infection were asymptomatic when the tests were conducted 10 the proportion of asymptomatic covid-19 patients on the diamond princess cruise ship was estimated to be 505 and the proportion among the evacuated japanese citizens was estimated to be 308 3 11 in addition a study suggested that at least 59 of the infected cases went undetected in wuhan which potentially includes asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases 8 12 in this study we enrolled 38 patients with close contact with covid-19 who exhibited persistently negative rt-pcr results for sars-cov-2 and aimed to evaluate their antibody for sars-cov-2 via serological tests to the best of our knowledge this report is among the first reports on tracing of the index patients via serology testingamong the 38 study participants enrolled in this study the median age of the patients was 475 years interquartile range 2655925 and 11 289 were female of the 38 close contacts who were tested nine cases were found positive for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody the positive serologic test results were reported with consistent results from wondfo and bioscience biotechnology co ltd both of which have been approved by the chinese national drug administration colloidal gold immunochromatography reagent from wondfo biotechnology co ltd and chemiluminescence reagent for immunoglobulin g from bioscience biotechnology co ltd were used to detect sars-cov-2 specific antibodies according to the manufacturers instructions of the nine asymptomatic cases two cases were presumed to be index patients of local cases figure 1 three cases were local patients who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients were found positive on sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing figure 2 and four cases were close contacts of covid-19 patients and had undefined roles in disease transmission figure 3case 1 was a 39-year-old woman who lived in wuhan and drove to loudi on january 22 2020 to visit a relative who developed fever and cough on february 9 2020 and tested positive on rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 on february 12 2020 figure 1 case 1 showed negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 on nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on february 12 17 and 24 and exhibited no fever cough dyspnea headache fatigue gastrointestinal or other covid-19 symptoms and she did not receive any therapeutic intervention over this period a blood sample collected on february 28 2020 showed that she tested positive on a serological test for sars-cov-2 figure 1 case 1 was presumed to have viral shedding during january 22 and january 25 2020 she spontaneously recovered before february 12 2020 and had no covid-19-related symptoms during the following 2 monthscase 2 a 52-year-old man lived in wuhan and took the train to loudi on january 15 2020 four close contacts of case 2 were later diagnosed with covid-19 figure 1 specifically one close contact had never been in contact with the other three close contacts case 2 presented with occasional cough but denied any fever dyspnea headache fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms over the period as case 2 had an occasional cough and four of his close contacts were confirmed to have covid-19 case 2 underwent medical examination from february 3 to 5 chest computed tomography ct scanning images recorded on february 4 and 7 showed exudative lesions in both lungs however the rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2 that were repeated four times with nasopharyngeal swab samples were all negative figure 1 whereas the anti-mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibody tests on february 7 were positive during the 2-week home quarantine without specific therapeutic intervention case 2 reported that his cough had resolved no characteristic symptom of covid-19 was reported thereafter however a blood sample collected on february 28 2020 tested positive for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody figure 1 although case 2 had no covid-19-related symptoms or complications during the following 2 monthscases 35 were local residents without travel histories in the past 3 months and were infected by the presumed index patients from the previous epidemiologic investigation these patients presumably recovered spontaneously before their index patients were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 figure 2 cases 69 had been to wuhan or had traveled since the covid-19 outbreak and they thus had an undefined role in disease transmission figure 3 cases 39 had persistently negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 without covid-19 symptoms but tested positive on serological tests for sars-cov-2 the cases denied previous exposure to sars-cov-2 and received no therapeutic intervention or complained of covid-19-related symptoms or complications during the following 2 monthsnine additional asymptomatic patients of covid-19 were identified via serological tests in 38 close contacts of covid-19 patients who had persistently negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 local covid-19 cases are rare in loudi district which has a total of 76 symptomatic patients and 26 asymptomatic patients who were identified via rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2underestimation of asymptomatic infections of covid-19 has been suggested as an increasing number of infected people have not traveled to epidemic hotspots or been linked to known covid-19 patients 8 applying serological tests singapore identified the source of a cluster of 23 covid-19 patients who tested negative on rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 13 in this study we report nine asymptomatic patients identified via serological test in addition to 26 asymptomatic patients who were previously identified by the rt-pcr test the nine asymptomatic patients had multiple negative rt-pcr test results with the first rt-pcr test of these asymptomatic patients conducted almost immediately after their close contacts were identified as covid-19 patients thus a proportion of asymptomatic patients might have short viral shedding duration or may have viral nucleic acid loads that are undetectable on rt-pcr according to a previous study the interval from the first day of positive rt-pcr tests to the first day of continuous negative tests for the asymptomatic patient ranged from 1 to 21 days with five asymptomatic patients having persistently negative rt-pcr test results 1 day after the date of diagnosis 5 the results indicated the potential for the underestimation of the proportion of asymptomatic patients based on rt-pcr tests which possibly identifies only those with longer viral shedding period these results suggested that serological tests could serve as a more reliable method to estimate the asymptomatic proportion of covid-19 patientsstudies have suggested that symptomatic patients of covid-19 have higher transmissibility within 5 days of symptom onset than later on and infectivity might peak on or before symptom onset 14 15 however the epidemiologic characteristics of asymptomatic patients remain unclear a previous study has identified covid-19 transmission caused by an asymptomatic carrier who had normal chest ct findings 16 in addition the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients suggesting a similar transmission potential 17 herein we identified covid-19 transmission caused by two asymptomatic index patients who cleared the virus whereas their local relatives developed symptoms of covid-19serological test results of the 9 asymptomatic patients who had repeated negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 suggest that a proportion of the individuals infected with sars-cov-2 can recover without treatment indicating that some individuals may have highly efficient neutralizing antibodies admittedly this research was limited to a small cohort with nasopharyngeal swab samples of the asymptomatic cases collected after their close contacts were confirmed to be sars-cov-2 positive on rt-pcr further studies with a large cohort are needed to elucidate the viral shedding pattern and transmission characteristics of asymptomatic cases with sars-cov-2 infectionthis study was approved by the hunan normal university institutional review board written informed consent was obtained from the participants for the publication of the case

authors critically reviewed the manuscriptthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe covid-19 pandemic is probably the most challenging health crisis of the modern era as of april 2020 more than 180 countries around the world have registered at least one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus infection with more than 25 million positive patients around the world 1as the world health organizations general director pointed out testing is crucial 2 the detection of sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is achieved via the detection of the viral rna by real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 3 when properly collected and if the specimens collected for the analysis contains the virus rt-pcr has high specificity and sensitivity however this technique has some limitations such as the narrow number of patients that can be tested in a given time the increased risk of exposure to a high-dose of virus for the healthcare workers collecting the sample throat-swabbing can generate aerosol and a considerable amount of time from the test to its response 4 in addition if the sample is not properly collected which may be the case in a mass emergency screening where a single operator performs hundreds of swabs in a single shift this may lead to a high number of false-negative results with an overall sensitivity of about 3040 56 furthermore the rt-pcr requires certified laboratories expensive equipment and trained technicians to operatefinally a major constraint remains the cutoff value to ascertain whether a test is positive or not generally when a given value is reached the specimen tested is considered positive however the degradation of the probe-based fluorophore by cross-contamination or by nonspecific amplification of background nucleic acids forces the adoption of an arbitrary cut off below which the medical report is given as negative this operating procedure outside the clinical context can lead to evaluation errors raising the number of false-negative results moreover real-time amplification efficiency varies within and between laboratories and a set cutoff might not be constant across runs therefore it is recommended to normalize cutoff with relative or absolute quantification approaches 7the world health organization who has fostered the development of new strategies to standardize the diagnosis of covid-19 8 yet most countries have been completely unprepared for the onslaught of the virusa possible alternative to rt-pcr is the assessment of the immune response of the host to the virus however we cannot research covid-19 by merely translating the technologies and the know-how already in place and that comes from the study of other not comparable diseases in these three months since the beginning of the outbreak no protocols or real experimental studies have been carried out we still do not know about the immune response of the human body to sars-cov-2 and it is still unclear how we can evaluate the antibody production for the diagnosis of covid-19 and how to use igm and igg detection in single patients and the population for epidemiological purposes only recently the idea of producing easy-to-use decentralized point-of-care poc tests emerged and then deploying them widely 9 poc tests are simple easy to administer and to interpret and they can accelerate clinical decision-making and take some of the workload off centralized test laboratories for example sheridan 9 recently reported the current main commercial rapid test for sars-cov-2 in nature biotechnologysome are ten-min lateral flow immunoassays that detect igm and igg antibodies directed against sars-cov-2 xiamen amonmed

serological test cellex developed a similar one which is now also approved for the eu by the fdathe available poc tests need to be studied in the current emergency setting the who proposed a protocol template better to assess the effectiveness of serology testing 12 this is also consistent with what is suggested in the updated version of laboratory testing for coronavirus disease covid-19 in suspected human cases 8 however it is currently impossible to assess and compare all the different poc tests because of the lack of reliable dataas our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of covid-19 rapid tests and serological assays in real-life settings with a particular focus on territorial emergencies and the ongoing pandemic we designed a research protocol aimed to establish how to use these diagnostics correctly taking into account the different possible clinical and epidemiological scenarioscovid-19 is the clinical presentation of the infection of the virus sars-cov-2 13 the diagnosis is currently based on the detection of the rna of the virus via a nucleic acid amplification test naat according to corman et al 14 rt-pcr has a sensitivity and specificity of about 100 provided that the sample is taken with the proper and timely technique the choice of the perfect samples to use for rt-pcr is still under debate wenling et al 15 analyzed samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sputum nasal swabs fibro-bronchoscopy brush biopsy pharyngeal swabs stools and blood rt-pcr on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated the highest positive rates 93 followed by sputum with 72 recent studies suggest the use of rt-pcr on stools because the virus can attack the bowel 16 according to ai et al 17 the combined use of computed tomography ct and pcr can increase diagnostic sensitivity however ct often is not available in territorial settings and primary care or for screening purposes according to el-tholoth et al 18 rt-pcr has some limitations for the screening and diagnosis of covid-19 because the test is difficult to use in the community and because of the high number of false-negatives observedthe detection of specific igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 is a possible strategy to diagnose the infection the immune response triggered by the infection is currently under investigation similarly the long-term modification of the antibodies levels cannot be known at the moment the use of a fast performing validated a serological assay is requested by different authors such as xiao 19 and hick 20 but also the national health commission and state administration of traditional chinese medicine suggests the use of a serological test with igm and igg for covid-19 to confirm the negative results an emblematic example came from the recent italian experience patient zero was negative to all tests performed during the onset of the symptoms namely the pharyngo-nasal swab for rt-pcr and the serological test 19 these observations support the idea that two negative serological tests are necessary to rule out the infection when a quantitative analysis is available the following procedure should be respected two paired serum samples should be taken from the patient with a suspected diagnosis of covid-19 patients with clinical symptomology suggestive of the disease or close contacts with patients with a known positive test for sars-cov-2 infection baseline serum should be taken as early as possible within the incubation period of contact and convalescent serum should be taken 24 weeks after the last contact positive serum-specific igm or specific igg antibody title in the recovery phase 4 times higher than that in the acute phase can be used as diagnostic criteria for suspected patients with negative naat igm is usually measurable 10 days after symptom onset while igg is detectable 12 days after the patient is symptomatic in fact the optimal timing for the convalescent sample needs still to be establishedwhen compared to naat the serological test appears more suitable for screening purposes in a population a recent study from jin et al 20 emphasizes the utility of the serological test in a wide cohort also when there are few positive patients not only when the probability pre-test is high bai et al 21 used igm to define negative and positive case in wide samples from a general population and encouraged the use of the serological test also in asymptomatic patients to confine the spread of the outbreak this is also consistent with an interesting article by li et al 22 that recommends the use of serological surveys to determine the incidence of subclinical infectionsthis test however may have some limitations to avoid false-positives because of cross-reactivity the antigen used for the serological test should come from properly purified sars-cov-2 according to meyer et al 23 and following the whos recommendations the right choice and the appropriate purification of antigens is essential to obtain validated serological tests in fact cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses can be challenging therefore only the most recent testsvalidated from laboratories that have isolated the viruscan be usedserum antibody determination methods include among others colloidal gold immunochromatography elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay chemiluminescence immunoassay xiang et al 24 recently compared elisa to gica colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay both have high sensitivity and specificity without a significant difference h0ha 005to enhance the accuracy of the diagnosis liu et al 25 suggested using rt-pcr in the first days from the infection and then to use the serological test alone for the disease monitoringli et al 10 described the results from the use of a rapid serological test in 525 patients the test had a sensitivity of 886 and a specificity of 9063 for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2immune response to a first-time infection needs time to grow symptoms can occur while the organism is preparing to fight and in the first days from infection the immunoassay can be negative indeed no cross-reactivity was detected in subjects with previous coronaviruses infection 26 a similar level of precision is reported by cassaniti et al in a letter to the editor where the authors do not endorse the use of the colloidal gold rapid test in emergency settings for triage of patients with suspected covid-19 26 nevertheless this recommendation remains controversial as there are some inconsistencies within the results presented the sampling methods the data processing and the patients targeted for the study on the other hand more recently long qx et al emphasized the importance of serological testing both in clinical and epidemiological settings 27a rapid test for sars-cov-2 is the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip assay zhang et al 27 demonstrated that the eukaryotic spike proteins expressed rs1 and rs-rbd-mfc are more appropriate than the prokaryotic nucleocapsid proteins for covid-19 serological diagnosis the gica sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard rna-based tests they prepared six recombinant proteins including three s spike proteins rs1 rs-rbd rs-rbd-mfc and three n nucleocapsid proteins rn rn1 rn2 because the s protein is a transmembrane protein three s protein fragments were prepared using a eukaryotic expression system while three n proteins were prepared using a prokaryotic expression system preliminary evaluation by indirect elisa revealed that the three s proteins rs1 rs-rbd rs-rbd-mfc were superior in performance lower background and higher optical densit values to the three n proteins however the antigenicity of s proteins and that of the n proteins could not be confirmed in this study because the influence of prokaryotic expression method used to produce the n proteins is difficult to predict they speculated that this difference is due to the relatively high sensitivity and early response to the s antigen compared to the n antigen in patients with covid-19 thus the n proteins antigenicity should be studied after expression in a eukaryotic system in futurezhang et al 28 selected two recombinant proteins with the highest elisa titers rs1 and rs-rbd-mfc to develop a sandwich-format gica strip to detect total antibodies igm and igg against hcov-19 gica colloidal gold immunochromatography assay a simple and rapid serological method is especially suitable for timely diagnosis and large-scale sample screening the performance of the gica strip which was evaluated with 814 clinical samples showed to be rapid 10 min highly sensitive 8689 and specific 9939 by diagnosing covid-19 in rt-pcr-negative patients who were clinically confirmed covid-19 positive by ct a recent study showed that the sensitivity of the total antibody igm and igg test is higher than that of the igm or igg test 29currently there is no gold standard for the identification of covid-19 positive or negative subjects however the commonly adopted standard is the rt-pc carried out with the methods suggested by the who 2 we therefore selected the articles and data set where the control was the rt-pcr carried out on selected groups of people certainly negative eg healthy rt-pcr negative volunteers or affected by covid-19 rt-pcr positive symptomatic patientsthe data for the test validation are derived from li 10 capello 30 paradiso 31 cassaniti 26 as well as the data provided by the manufacturer provided by the producer alpha pharma inc bitonto bari 70031 italy available on httpswwwa-psit in the article by paradiso 31 it was not possible to deduce the data referring only to igmit should be noted that the specificity was very high in all studies table 1 all the trials included patients enrolled in the early stage of pandemics with no known exposure to sars-cov-2 and no symptoms of covid-19 ie healthy volunteers with no contact and asymptomatic and with negative rt-pcr those patients could be reasonably considered true negative subjects starting from this assumption basically no false positives were recorded nevertheless because of the peculiarity of this infection and because of the epidemiology of the pandemic a negative rt-pcr and a negative medical history cannot rule out a possible sars-cov-2 infection even in asymptomatic patients so that it would be difficult to compare the results of any test with a gold standard aimed to assess the sensitivity and sensibility of the test itself thus research protocols in the future should consider some specific features of the infection of the way it spreads among the population and of the immune response of the host to the disease for this reason the comparison with rt-pcr alone is not enough to establish the effectiveness of quantitative or qualitative serologic tests besides the long-time persistence of immunoglobulins in the serum of the immunized persons should be addressed as well as the absence of viral rna at the sites of the swabs that can give negative pcr results in healed immunized patients table 1 shows the sensitivity and specificity data of the colloidal gold rapid test versus rt-pcr oropharyngeal swab as published in individual articles cassaniti-a column was computed based on data reported in the article relative to igmstill because of these reasons the collected sensitivity values may vary widely among the different studies consequently at present we cannot establish a mean sensitivity value in addition the variations are possibly determined by the time of testing and by the eligibility criteria which were not uniform in the different studiesin any case the high precision indicates the absence of analytical errors determined by cross-reactivity as also reported by some authors 26to better understand the variability in sensitivity and better assess the accuracy of the test we considered results of igg and igm testing separately we performed the analysis via the meta analytic approach to evaluate the heterogeneity of the effect size the results are shown in the forest plots of figure 1 igg and figure 2 igmfor the igg figure 1 odds ratios we found both significant fixed p  0001 and random effects p  0001 heterogeneity was very high with cochrans q  461 p  00001 while the i2 statistic accounting for variations due to actual heterogeneity and not to chance was 902 ci 95 from 799 to 952 performing a second meta-analysis data not shown using all the pooled cassaniti igg data we did not find substantial differences for fixed effects we found again p  0001 whereas for random effects we obtained p  0002 cochrans q was 3778 p  00001 and the i2 statistic was 894 ci95 from 781 to 949in addition for the igm figure 2 odds ratio we found significant fixed and random effects p  0001 in both cases heterogeneity was less high than igg for cochrans q we got 609 p  01072 thus a not significant heterogeneity even keeping p  01 as significance cutoff as suggested by higgins et al given the low number of studies 32 and the i2 statistic was found 508 ci95 from 00 to 837 furthermore for igm we performed a second meta-analysis data not shown using all the pooled cassaniti igm data for fixed and random effects we found again p  0001 with a cochrans q  502 p  01702 and the i2 statistic was 403 ci95 from 00 to 798both meta-analyses revealed a high inconsistency at least in its broad confidence interval the i2 statistic is given by the ratio q-dq where d accounts for the degrees of freedom of the system eg the number of meta-analyzed studies minus one in the case d  q then one keeps i2  0 with a ci of 95 from 00 to 100 for this reason adding a study to the meta-analysis can potentially decrease the inconsistency if the studies are very few as in our case however the heterogeneity observed and therefore the inconsistency can also be explained by the differences in patient selection and in the timing of the test the time-lapse from time 0the moment of the possible contact and infectionto the time the test was performed it would be therefore advisable to produce clinical protocols that could standardize the procedure and the classification of patients including the time of possible exposure the prevalence of the disease in a population the time of the onset of the symptoms and the type and timing of other tests performed on the subjects in fact as the heterogeneity in sensitivity observed in the previous studies may depend on the different settings and the different timing it would be advisable to serially test patients recording and evaluating the immune response dynamics over timethis is a research protocol based on a template addressing complexity that is aimed mainly to investigate the possible use of a rapid test for the evaluation of the disease in a population when specific conditions are consideredalthough the result of a rapid diagnostic test offers only binary information positive or negative igm positive or negative igg the result can be crucial in assessing a patient when all the complexity of this disease is considered moreover it can provide a useful tool for the continuous screening of high-risk populations for the implementation of public health programshowever as advised before the information coming from the test alone can be worthless if we do not consider the whole pictureaccording to these criteria we classified the patients to be tested according to the possible inception point and therefore the possible clinical scenario we then produced different groups based on exposure and risk of exposure on the selection criteria and on the immune response to the different tests used to detect the infection these criteria are summarized in table 5this classification allows the evaluation of the upper and the lower limits of the time-lapse where we can place the inception point for each group considered as for figure 3aside from selected and limited cases in fact we cannot establish the exact time of the infection yet we can still gather valuable information if we evaluate the results of the test in different clusters and populations we consider for this specific purpose patients routinely attending primary care facilities or an outpatient department a general practitioners survey or any other health center in the communitywe might apply a similar scheme also in acute settings however we consider the peculiarity of the territorial emergency where asymptomatic patients can unconsciously spread the infection and the characteristics of a primary care department where patients can be followed-up over a longer periodfor our purpose enrolled patients would be classified according to the groups presented in table 5 and for their demographic features in addition all the available information on the recent and past medical history should be recorded with a particular focus on pre- and post-covid-19 results of laboratory testing and other investigations see table 3 and on behaviors or medical conditions that may increase the risk of becoming infected and of becoming seriously illpatients will be serially tested with the colloidal gold vivadiag covid-19 igmigg rapid test the suggested frequency is weekly a shorter interval may be suggested in high-risk settings each patient enrolled in the study would perform an rt-pcr test at the beginning of the study and if symptomaticpatients should be regularly tested up to six months after the estimated time of contagion investigators will record the symptoms and any other medical investigation together with their date of onset and resolutionthe primary outcomes areto establish the accordance of the test with the clinical features of the disease and to assess how the test results change over time in the different clusters of patients as summarized in table 5to establish the reliability of the serologic rapid test to detect a sars-cov-2 infection and therefore its sensitivity and specificity when the integration of anamnestic clinical laboratory molecular imaging criteria are considered as the gold standardthe secondary outcome is the comparison of the serological rapid test with the rt-pcr commonly used to make an etiological diagnosis of covid-19in fact we cannot classify patients according to the results of a single test is positive or negative patients moreover the immune response of the host is still unknown as well as the level of immunity secondary to the infection thus the negative or positive status cannot be assessed and cannot be established by the result of a test the serological response should be interpreted with information coming from the clinical reports consequently before drafting conclusions the data analysis at the end of the study must consider the following considerationsif the test is positive even in the presence of a negative pcr the patient should be considered positive and treated according to his or her clinical picture when igm alone is positive the serological test shows a recent infection even if the patient has not developed any symptoms yet on the other hand if the test is positive for igg alone and the patient is asymptomatic the result can be used for epidemiological purposes some recent investigations 27 however show an inconsistent response of igm and igg in different patients with a seroconversion of both the immunoglobulin classes that reach 100 after a window periodif the test is negative in a symptomatic patient with a high exposure risk the serological test should be routinely repeated considering the window period between the time 0 of the infection and the production of circulating antibodieseven if rapid tests are designed to reduce the measure errors to avoid a false negative it is essential to follow the producers instructions to avoid procedural mistakes for this reason we chose for our research protocol a test based on a very easy procedure such as those already in use for other diseases also in very limited settings and laboratories with very poor resources or auto-diagnostic kits the test is also easy to perform and to read for minimally trained personnel nevertheless because we do not have yes-or-no tests available and given the characteristic of covid-19 it is unlikely that those can be created in the future the clinical assessment of the patients remains crucial this implies that medical history should be correctly collected and clinical signs must be accurately recorded to increase the chance of making a proper diagnosis prognosis and management planlastly all the data collected should be shared with other researchers to prompt further studies and consequently the whole dataset should always be made availablethis protocol dubs a first research trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04316728 available from httpclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04316728 aimed at evaluating the immune response of negative patients during a covid-19 outbreak plus the clinical performance of the test in early detection the infection and the reliability of the test in those patients who develop clinical signs of covid-19 during the trial preliminary unpublished data match the observations reported in table 1 showing a good correspondence with other research studies and also suggesting a role of serological test for the screening of asymptomatic patientsthe 2020 novel coronavirus pandemic is showing how weak the idea of global health is this worldwide emergency asks and needs prompt answers and original solutions the early diagnosis of coronavirus remains a major issue as a proper screening strategy can improve the design and implementation of workable public health models aimed to confine the virus and to reduce its devastating effect on the population it is therefore paramountalso considering the clinical complexity of this new diseaseto develop accurate user-friendly kits that can help doctors and healthcare workers to make a diagnosis of covid-19 thus molecular scientists must be front-runners in this race against the virus providing their expertise and the unique research capability of their fieldwe investigated the quick detection approach targeting viral igm or igg antibodies with the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic icg strip assay in comparison with real-time rt-pcr testing the advantages of the icg strip viral antibody detection are obvious first of all the sensitivity of the icg strip is comparable especially after 7 days of onset the detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative clinically diagnostic patients is impressive therefore icg strips are highly recommended to be utilized as the supplementary diagnostic approach in clinical applications the icg strip can also be widely adopted in areas where diagnostic capacity is limited secondary the icg strip assay is operational as it is ready to use and timesaving the assay can be finished within 15 min without specialized equipment third unlike oral swab sampling that may cause stimulated retching and coughing which increases the exposure risk of laboratory technicians the blood collection could avoid the unnecessary risk and reduce the operation steps that may cause aerosol fourth the detection of antibodies may also indicate the disease recovery as immunoglobulins are among the most important soldiers in the battle of viruses patients who initially detected as virus-positive and gradually became negative but with detectable igg or igm during the disease progression may be considered as recovered from this battle it is noteworthy that the icg strip can only provide qualitative results but the serological elisa assay against the viral antibody offered the quantitative antibody titer and is regarded as the superior alternation at this point last but not least the strip can be used for community surveillance and therefore for the design of public health strategies aimed to confine the dissemination of the virus to contain an ongoing epidemic and to call off whatever restrictions and measures are needed to reduce the spread of the disease in a timely mannerin conclusion the main advantages of the serological test are higher accuracy in detecting a sars-cov-2 infection even in asymptomatic patients or before the onset of the symptoms when the test is performed after a significant amount of time from the suspect day of contagion and the simpler way of use that allows operators with minimal training to screen a high number of people with fewer sampling mistakes finally it reduces the exposure of health workers performing the test to the virustaking into account the background and in particular long results 27 we speculate that serological tests although needing to be more thoroughly studied could be indispensable weapons for front-line doctors who work in a decentralized setting to have rapid answerstherefore it is crucial to gather all the possible information every time a patient is tested and assessed to understand better how the infection and the immune response work so that we can build risk classes and individual and population profiles that could help clinicians and health policy-makers to define a better strategy to fight the infection and the spread of the disease allowing at the same time people and society to safely go back to normal or more regular lifewe finally endorse and foster a proactive collaboration among molecular researchers and clinicians with the creation of multicentric studies aimed to produce tools that can be used as weapons for the war against this invisible enemy that may undermine the future of the same humankindthe pandemic outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 were first discovered in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 the covid19 was caused by the novel coronavirus namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 it took 30 days to spread to all provinces of china

1

 and has been reported from about 200 countries by march 30 2020

2

 the sarscov2 was named because it shares 88 nucleotide similarity to two batderived severe acute respiratory syndrome sarslike coronaviruses and 79 similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov that appeared in 2003 which affected 26 countries and killed about 800 people

 there are four common types of human coronavirus that have been reported such as hku1 nl63 229e and oc43 that cause the mild symptom of common flu whereas sarscov middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus merscov and novel sarscov2 were reported causing severe or fatal symptoms the coronavirus is an enveloped nonsegmented positivesense and singlestranded rna virus with a crownlike appearance figure

 shows the coronavirus structure that composes four types of protein such as spike glycoprotein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n the s protein is playing an important role in invading into the host by interacting with human receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptorbinding domain rbd of s protein contributed its immunogenic that attracted many neutralizing antibodies

 they are all potential molecular targets for the identification of sarscov2 infection currently there is no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine for covid19 therefore it is necessary to deploy a robust diagnostic methodology which is rapid accurate and ultrasensitive to isolate infected patients from the healthy populationthe testing of sarscov2 is grouped into molecular testing and serology testing the molecular testing includes nucleic acid amplification test naat such as realtime reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction rrtpcr

 according to world health organization who interim guidance on laboratory testing of covid19 in suspected human

 the respiratory materials were required to collect to perform naat the unique sequence rna of the virus including nucleocapsid n envelope e spike protein s and rnadependent rnapolymerase rdrp genes are targeted to analyze using rrtpcr

8

 on january 23 2020 the first covid19 detection kit using rrtpcr was published which targeted rdrp n and e genes of sarscov2

8

 as of now there are many inhouse or commercial covid19 molecular assays available from worldwide for instance 1 cdc 2019ncov realtime reverse transcriptase pcr diagnostic panel was developed by the united states centers for disease control and prevention this diagnostic panel is working with applied biosystems 7500 fast dx realtime pcr instrument with sds 14 software 2 new coronavirus nucleic acid assay which targeted on orf1ab and n genes was developed by chinese national institute for viral disease control and prevention 3 molecular test kits from four companies such as seegene inc kogene biotech co ltd sd biosensor inc and solgent co were approved by ministry food and drug safety and korea centers for disease control and prevention which are now widely being used in south korea

 primer and probe design are critical for the detection of or viral rna that is easy to mutate taiwan centers for disease control provides rrtpcr primers targeting e rdrp and n genes for firstline screening confirmatory and additional confirmatory assay respectivelythe outbreaks of the covid19 pandemic have led to an increase of thousands of active cases every day all over the world and we are racing against time to find a test to quickly detect the virus and isolate the infected patient from healthy population to stop the virus transmission from a further outbreak the united states food and drug administration is moving fast to approve a few covid19 molecular test kits under emergency use authorization powers cepheid inc mesa biotech inc and biofire defense llc were recently granted food and drug administration fda approval of their rapid diagnostic test that could give the test result reduced to 1 h compared to traditional rtpcr methods that required 34 h on march 27 2020 abbott announced the launch of a molecular pointofcare test which uses an isothermal rna amplification method to deliver positive results in 5 min and negative results in 13 min it is expected to produce about 5 million tests per month httpswwwabbottcomcorpnewsroomproduct-and-innovationdetect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minuteshtmlin addition to its rna the s and the n proteins are frequent targets for the detection of conorovirus in contrast to that of the rna the development of a detection kit on viral proteins is still in progress a probe usually a specific antibody is needed before a successful viral protein detection method can be developed in early march 2020 academia sinica taiwan reported the first monoclonal antibody against n protein of sarscov2 with their antibody library in hand the team screened against n proteins from seven different viral species to obtain 1 antibody against only sarscov2 n protein 9 against only sarscov n protein and 36 against both sarscov2 and sarscov n proteins

10

 the results indicated that rapid immunebased test kit of sarscov2 coronavirus can be developed in the future it also shows the complexity and time consumed in obtaining and screening an antibody for an unbiased test targeting specific viral protein the procedure for the preparation of specific antibody from laboratory animal has been very well established and it could be expected that numerous antibodies specific for a sarscov2 protein will be reported soon 25 strains of antibodies from three covid19 patients have also been prepared from chang gung memorial hospital taiwan there are 13 strains of monoclonal antibodies mabs targeting on s protein and 12 strains of mabs targeting on n protein of the sarscov2 these antibodies especially those targeting on s protein can be a potential probe for the detection of s protein or the whole sarscov2 virus the advantage of immunebased vial detection is its simplicity and speed within 15 min however the antibodies prepared from sarscov2 protein antigen may crossreact with proteins from other similar viruses such as sarscov and mers and thus a tedious screening procedure is needed before a specific testing kit can be developedas aforementioned the serology testing of covid19 is not targeting the virus itself but the antibodies such as immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg induced following viral infection these immunoglobulins were serological testing markers for after the patient has early 36 days after exposure to the virus igm and late virus infections after 8 days igg response respectively

11

 the serological testing is crucial to identify active patients asymptomatic carriers or convalescent persons and provide population surveillance these data could be used to analyze and estimate the sarscov2 epidemiology and virology

12

 and help to contain the outbreak of the pandemic the highly reactive human could be the donor of convalescent serum for therapeutic

13

 the who interim guidance on covid19 testing suggested collecting blood stool or autopsy materials such as lungs deceased patients as serology testing specimens

7

 as it has been reported that several factors could contribute to a high falsenegative rate when using naat serology testing should also be taken into consideration as alternative testing or correlation testing

14

 there are companies such as guangzhou wondfo biotech china innovita biological technology china pharma berlin germany and raybiotech inc usa that have released various types of test kits that specifically test on covid19 igm and iggspecificity and sensitivity are two fundamental requirements for an effective diagnosis it is also important that the testing method is user friendly rna detection is the most frequently used method for the identification of covid19 patients because this method is extremely sensitive due to the power of nucleic acid amplification and also highly specific by using complementary nucleic acid probeprimer for the identification of a particular rna the major drawback in such an emergency situation is probably the requirement of welltrained personnel and lengthy testing time usually 34 h to run the test however it has been announced that positivenegative covid19 can be determined in about 10 min by using the isothermal amplification method this may due to the simplification of the naat procedure and the high amount of the sarscov2 at the beginning of the infection to be detecteddetections on viral proteins such as s and n proteins give complementary information to that of rna detection from the same sample this method is more direct without amplification but is less sensitive it needs more effort to obtain a suitable probe usually antibody but the testing method can be simple recent developments in biosensing technologies can significantly improve the protein sensing sensitivity such as the use of magnetic bead to concentrate the protein molecules or by applying nanowire fieldeffect transistor as a transducer many of the entrepreneurs may take this opportunity to fasten their product development serology testings targeting on viralinduced antibodies are given different information as those for viral rna and proteins from sarscov2 although the protein testing method is similar the targets are not part of the virus and the testing specimens used can be quite different as compared to those for viral protein detectionit is unfortunate that the world is currently suffering from the covid19 epidemic however we should expect that such an incident would reappear we wish that the world would be better prepared every time we face a potential spread of an infectious disease biosensing technologies have progressed rapidly in the past decade the pandemic outbreaks of covid19 continue to remind us that diagnostic tools are critical and needed to be prepared in advancesuh kuan yong pingchia suand yuhshyong yang

study protocol active surveillance for respiratory infections was performed at rochester general hospital rochester new york from 15 november 1999 to 15 april 2000 as part of an ongoing study to identify influenza and rsv infections all patients 65 years old and those with underlying heart or lung conditions admitted with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection bronchitis exacerbation of copd congestive heart failure chf influenza or pneumonia were invited to participate demographic and clinical information was collected during patient interviews and from medical records combined nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were tested for influenza virus and rsv by culture and rt-pcr acute and convalescent blood samples at 4 weeks were obtained for serologic testing in as many cases as possible during the 5 months of surveillance 332 illnesses in 316 hospitalized persons were evaluated sixty-one cases of influenza a infection and 22 cases of rsv infection were identified and excluded from subsequent analysis of the 249 remaining cases 100 samples were randomly selected for rhinovirus and coronavirus testing
laboratory methods for rhinovirus and coronavirus rt-pcr rtpcr for human rhinovirus hrv and human coronaviruses hcv was done by methods described elsewhere with minor modifications 12 13 total rna was extracted from 200 l of sample by matrix affinity chromatography qiaamp dna blood kit qiagen the eluted rna was transcribed into cdna with murine reverse transcriptase mmlv-rt gibco brl and virus specific oligonucleotide primer for 1 h at 37c after mmlv-rt denaturation at 95c virus-specific 5 biotinylated oligonucleotide primer and taq polymerase applied biosystems were added and 35 cycles of pcr were run consisting of denaturation 1 min at 95c for hrv 2 min at 95c for hcv annealing 15 min at 482c for hrv 1 min at 60c for hcv and dna extension for 1 min at 72c the pairs of primers for coronaviruses oc43 and 229e were used in the same reaction in a multiplex format excess primers dntps taq dna polymerase and salts were removed by adsorbing the amplified product to the qiaquick silica-gel membrane qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen the presence of the pcr product was detected by microplate hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled virusspecific probes as described elsewhere 13 positive and negative controls were previously tested nasal washings either containing or lacking specific hrv or hcv rna
laboratory methods for coronavirus serologic testing serologic evidence of coronavirus infection was defined as a 3-fold increase in coronavirus-specific igg as measured by eia coronavirus 229e antigens were prepared from infected wi-38 cell lysates and oc43 antigens in suckling mouse brains eia plates were coated with either 229e or oc43 antigens to nunc flat-bottom plates in bicarbonate buffer control plates were prepared by using uninfected wi-38 cell lysates or mouse brain suspensions serum samples obtained during acute and convalescent illness acute and convalescent serumsamples were added to wells in duplicate in serial 2-fold dilutions from 1400 to 102400 serum igg was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human antibody followed by substrate the end-point titer was defined as the highest dilution with an optical density 0100 that was at least twice that of the control plate 6
statistical methods means were compared with students t test and proportions were compared using 2 and fishers exact tests as appropriateof the 100 cases evaluated rhinovirus andor coronavirus were identified as a pathogen in 12 of them four nasal specimens were rt-pcr positive for rhinovirus 4 were positive for coronavirus 229e 1 was positive for coronavirus oc43 and 1was positive for both rhinovirus and coronavirus 229e of the 100 cases acute and convalescent serum samples were available for 88 of them from which 2 additional oc43 infections were identified the 6 patients who tested positive by pcr for coronaviruses were seronegative for coronavirusrhinovirus infections occurred sporadically throughout the winter although coronavirus oc43 infections occurred primarily in december and january and coronavirus 229e infections occurred primarily in march and april the mean sd age of patients was 74  11 years with similar numbers of men and women in both groups table 1 all patients had significant underlying chronic medical conditions primarily chf and copd and 1 patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll consistent with the high rate of lung disease 92 were active or previous smokers 33 took corticosteroids daily and 50 received oxygen at home seventy-five percent had exposure to young children compared with patients infected with influenza during the same period the rhinoviruscoronavirus group had significantly more lung disease nasal congestion and cough were common symptoms 67 and 78 respectively as were lower respiratory tract symptoms of dyspnea 83 and sputum production 58 constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and myalgias occurred in only 33 of patients with hrv or hcv compared with 54 in influenza virus-infected patients fever was significantly less common in the hrv and hcv group than in the influenza group mean temperature 374c10c vs 384c11c p  005 patients were quite ill at admission with 75 demonstrating wheezing and rales by auscultation supplemental oxygen was required for all but 1 individual most patients received steroids 75 bronchodilators 83 and antibiotics 83 all patients eventually recovered and were discharged after a mean length of stay of 8 days there were no distinct features of rhinovirus or coronavirus infectionfour patients had radiographically proven pneumonia 2 with coronavirus and 2 with rhinovirus infection one 89-year-old woman with rhinovirus infection had a history of copd and presented with a temperature of 393c an sao2 level of 57 and an infiltrate on chest x-rayno blood or sputumcultures were obtained the other rhinovirus-positive patient with pneumonia had cll a temperature of 390c and blood and sputum cultures that grew no pathogens both patients with coronavirus infection and pneumonia were elderly women with chf and presented with nasal congestion cough and dyspnea and had visible rhinorrhea at examination blood cultures were sterile and 1 patient tested positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa in an inadequate sputum sample two individuals without pneumonia had evidence of concurrent bacterial infection 1 patient with positive coronavirus serologic test results had streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the sputum of 1 person with coronavirus 229eduring a winter season when influenza was prevalent and accounted for a substantial number of hospitalizations rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were diagnosed by rt-pcr and serologic testing in 12 of patients without influenza or with rsv these data provide more evidence that not all serious respiratory illnesses that occur during the winter months are always the flu our results are consistent with a recent study by el-sahly et al 9 documenting coronavirusrhinovirus infections in 26 47 of 546 persons x003e35 years old who were hospitalizedwith cardiopulmonary illnesses and with a 4-year study by glezen et al 4 in which viruses were found to be a common trigger for acute decompensation leading to hospitalization in persons with preexisting lung diseases in the latter study of 417 adults 45 years old who were hospitalized for respiratory infections influenza viruses were detected most frequently in 8 of patients whereas rhinoviruses were detected in 2 and coronaviruses in 3 of patients however this study did not use rt-pcr to detect viruses and rates likelywould have been higher if more-sensitive diagnostic tools were available in a study of inner-city adults with asthma rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were more common than influenza in patients presenting to an emergency room 10 sixty percent of rhinovirus and 71 of coronavirus infections were detectable only by rt-pcrthe higher rate of infection in our study likely reflects the use of rt-pcr rather than culture for diagnosis aswell as the months studied and the elderly population a limitation of this study is the lack of a control group of hospitalized elderly patients without respiratory illnesses previous studies have shown that rhinoviruses may be detected in 3 of asymptomatic elderly adults 11 the use of a method of diagnosis that detects minute quantities of rna raises the question of the role of the virus in causality of the illness unfortunately samples from a control group were not available it was not unexpected that there were patients with positive coronavirus pcr results but negative serologic test results since antibody responses may be impaired in frail elderly personsof note persons hospitalized because of rhinoviruscoronavirus infections were more frail than those with influenza with all persons having either significant cardiopulmonary disease or cancer this finding is consistent with a study by nicholson et al 11 in which the presence of chronic medical conditions or smoking increased the risk of lower respiratory tract disease by 40 in elderly adults with rhinovirus infection in the study by el-sahly et al 9 asthma copd or chf was present in 73 of patients 35 years old who were hospitalized because of rhinovirus or coronavirus infections in additionwald et al 5 found that rhinovirus infections produced more-protracted lower respiratory tract symptoms in nursing home residents with copd or a history of smokingillnesses were significant with the mean length of stay 1 week and nearly all patients received supplemental oxygen steroids and antibiotics one patient required intensive care but all survivedof interest 2 patientswith rhinovirus infections had high fevers and radiographic evidence of pneumonia rhinoviruses are rarely implicated as a cause of pneumonia which is believed to reflect their biologic characteristics 14 however recent data from papadopoulos et al 15 suggest that infection of the lower airways is possible and that rhinoviruses may have direct effects on the lower respiratory tract epithelium the high frequency of lower respiratory tract symptoms in ambulatory elderly persons with rhinovirus infections and the recovery of rhinovirus from expectorated sputum samples are additional evidence for viral invasion of the lower airways 5 11 it is unknown how often bacterial suprainfection in the lower respiratory tract follows hrv or hcv infection despite these uncertainties mixed viralbacterial infection in our patients seems likely although one person had cll thus making a viral pneumonia a possibilityin summary infectionwith agents that typically cause colds in young adults may lead to hospitalization in frail elderly persons with underlying heart and lung problems it does not appear that healthy elderly persons are at high risk from these agents these viruses although not as common as influenza and rsv among hospitalized adults also circulate during the winter months producing similar clinical syndromes the use of rt-pcr improves the ability to identify these previously difficult to detect viruses but further studies with control groups are needed to fully define the impact of hcv and hrv in hospitalized elderly adultsas of april 14 2020 just under 2 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have been reported worldwide1 with the pandemic growing at an alarming rate and national governments struggling to control local epidemics because of scant diagnostics and impermanent non-pharmaceutical interventions we should look to additional epidemiological solutions locations such as singapore and taiwan have been successful in slowing epidemic growth by using intensive surveillance with broader testing strategies to identify and contain cases2 3
in the lancet infectious diseases sarah ee fang yong and colleagues4 report three clusters of covid-19 cases identified in singapore in early 2020 by active case-finding and contact tracing and confirmed with rt-pcr one cluster from a church church a was previously identified5 and linked to two imported cases from wuhan china the two additional clusters church b and a family gathering were attributable to community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by one individual interacting with both clusters serological platforms were developed and assessed for confirmation of sars-cov-2-specific antibody responses to capture past infections by serological analysis yong and colleagues identified the missing link between the church a cluster and the other two clustersan individual who had twice tested negative by rt-pcr by linking all three clusters yong and colleagues highlight the success of such surveillance measures to capture many cases and effectively slow the spread of covid-19 in singaporethis investigation exemplifies the failings of rt-pcr as a sole diagnostic method in surveillance because of its inability to detect past infection and the added value of serological testing which if captured within the correct timeframe after disease onset can detect both active and past infections6 7 in public health practice serological analysis can be useful for rapid case-identification and the subsequent chain of events to actively identify close contacts recommend quarantine and define clusters of cases contact tracing which is a necessary but insufficient means of disease control needs careful effort and is sensitive to timing to be effective particularly in highly dense populations as shown in singapore serological analysis can be useful for contact tracing in urban environments and linking clusters of cases retrospectively to delineate transmission chains and ascertain how long transmission has been ongoing or to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the populationbeyond the immediate use of serological data to identify and contain cases these data can also be used to set control policies population serological testing specifically measuring sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody titres can estimate the total number of infections by assessing the number of individuals who have mounted an immune response regardless of whether an infection was subclinical or happened in the recent past current data suggest antibodies persist for at least 4 weeks8 by providing estimates of who is and is not immune to sars-cov-2 serological data can be used in at least four ways first to estimate epidemiological variables such as the attack rate or case-fatality rate which are necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred and its burden second to strategically deploy immune health-care workers to reduce exposure of the virus to susceptible individuals third to assess the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions at the population-level and inform policy changes to release such measures fourth to identify individuals who mounted a strong immunological response to the virus and whose antibody isolates can be used to treat patients via plasma therapy9
although the potential for serological assays to help control the covid-19 pandemic is substantial the complexity of developing and validating a diagnostic test is not fully elucidated by yong and colleagues4 serological assays are currently being developed for widespread use10 yet several challenges remain first assessing the sensitivity and specificity of tests particularly for determining disease during the acute phase of infection second verifying the test is not detecting cross-reactivity with other viral pathogens that result in false-positive results third understanding antibody kinetics over time to distinguish thresholds of immunity because we do not know how long immunity to this novel coronavirus might last and finally ensuring the test is reliable for distribution and is cost-efficient although rt-pcr diagnostics will still be vital for identifying acute infection as the sars-cov-2 pandemic continues to spread and cases accumulate serological testing and data will prove increasingly important to understand the pandemics past and predict its future

an upsurge of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection has been recently described in countries of the arabian peninsula resulting in exported cases from these countries to the european union 1 cases of mers-cov infection are associated with a high case fatality rate since there is no available treatment there is a scarcity of data on specific therapeutic interventions for the disease published reports propose the use of known antivirals based on extrapolation of data from i the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic that was also associated with the circulation of a novel coronavirus ii in vitro data iii animal experimental infections and therapy data and iv limited clinical data for actual mers-cov infections 2 3 4 however no clear-cut recommended therapeutic regimen exists and the evidence for grading such interventions is generally low with the exception of the use of convalescent serum that based on biological effects is given the highest grade 5 moreover little is known about the viral kinetics of mers-cov-associated infection especially when a specific antiviral or other therapeutic intervention is attempteda case of mers-cov has recently been described in greece in a traveller who had extensive contact with the healthcare environment in jeddah saudi arabia 6 here we describe molecular serological and phylogenetic analyses of this case as well as evidence for a second case that was a close contact of the first patient furthermore we provide evidence of the kinetics and the pattern of viral excretion in biological specimens obtained from the first greek case while the patient was on a triple antiviral regimena preliminary report of the first imported laboratory-confirmed mers-cov case in greece has been described elsewhere 6 a full description of the course of illness and treatment regimen in relation to kinetics of virus shedding and immune response was prepared by review of the patient records in the course of the outbreak investigation 40 of 75 patients contacts including the patients wife provided an oropharyngeal sample for pcr testing 1 week after contact with the positive case 5 additional contacts were included in the serology examination group all were submitted to personal clinical monitoring for fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms and were advised to call the hellenic centre for disease control and prevention cdc command centre immediately in such an instance in addition all were offered the chance to provide serum samples on a voluntary basis for specific anti-mers antibody testing at baseline same time as the oropharyngeal pcr testing and 3 weeks after exposureduring the patients stay in the intensive care unit icu samples from the oropharynx trachea urine and faeces were tested for diagnostic evaluation and to monitor viral shedding a real-time reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr method based on amplification of the upstream envelope gene upe the nucleocapsid n gene and the open reading frame orf 1a of the virus was used for detection of mers-cov according to previously described methodology 7 8immunoglobulin g igg and igm antibody titres in serum samples were determined using an anti-mers-cov indirect immunofluorescence assay euroimmun ag lbeck germany confirmation of the serological findings was performed with a virus neutralisation assay as described previously 9samples from the patients upper respiratory tract underwent conventional or molecular testing for the presence of other respiratory pathogens thus cultures applied for

bocavirus and human metapneumovirus hmpv mws r-gene biomrieux marcy-ltoile france specific urine antigen testing of urine samples was utilised for legionella pneumophila and streptococcus pneumoniae binaxnow alere orlando fl a stool culture was performed due to a history of possible typhoid fever diagnosed by treating physicians in saudi arabia 6nucleotide sequences of 3-kb concatenated sequences of representative mers-covs were analysed and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the phyml method as described previously 10a 69-year-old patient of greek origin who was a permanent resident of jeddah presented to a tertiary care centre a few hours after arriving in athens greece on 17 april 2014 his chief complaints included fever since 8 april 2014 and diarrhoea since 10 april 2014 the most likely source of exposure was the hospital environment in jeddah the patient had no known co-morbidities at the time of initial evaluation a fever of 383 c was noted together with low oxygen saturation 92 although the patient exhibited minimal respiratory symptoms a chest radiograph depicted bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonia the patient was immediately placed under isolation because of suspicion of mers-cov infection and an antimicrobial regimen targeting community-acquired pneumonia was initiatedon 18 april 2014 mers-cov infection was confirmed by means of viral rna detection in a pharyngeal swab at the department of microbiology university of athens medical school athens greeceafter laboratory confirmation of mers-cov the patient was transferred to a specialised respiratory disease unit in the sotiria chest diseases hospital of athens where he was treated in a negative pressure regular room in isolation until 20 april 2014 when due to deterioration of his respiratory function and development of acute respiratory disease syndrome ards he was intubated ventilated and transferred to a negative pressure room in the icu of the same hospital an empirical antiviral regimen was initiated on day 13 of illness consisting of oral po lopinavirritonavir 400100 mg twice daily pegylated interferon 180 g subcutaneously once per week for 12 days and ribavirin 2000 mg po loading dose followed by 1200 mg po every 8 h for 8 days based on available evidence 3 4 5 11 12 fig 1
the patient remained intubated exhibiting hypoxia and occasionally hypercapnia while breathing inspired oxygen in the range of 045060 he remained febrile with a plateau temperature of 39 c and a maximum value of 405 c on day 18 of illness fever started subsiding below 38 c on day 22 acute kidney injury was diagnosed on day 16 of illness and rapidly progressed to non-oliguric renal failure that reverted to rifle injury level ie two-fold increase in the serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate decrease by 50 or urine output 05 mlkgh for 12 h on day 21 the patients diarrhoea resolved gradually starting on day 13 and he developed constipation thereafter with normalisation of his bowel movements and gastrointestinal function on day 19 owing to development of jaundice and hyperbilirubinaemia attributed to ribavirin 13 the drug was discontinued on day 20 during the course of his hospitalisation the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon and eventually died from septic shock 2 months and 19 days after the initial diagnosiscultures and antigen detection were negative for l pneumophila and s pneumoniae virological testing was negative for the presence of any other respiratory virus no relevant enteric pathogens were identified as a cause of the patients diarrhoearna was detected in several consecutive patient samples from different sites that included faecal material and serum fig 1 shedding of mers-cov in the respiratory secretions of the patient was noted until the fourth week of illness whereas viraemia was last detected 15 days after onset of illness and 2 days after initiation of the triple combination antiviral regimen consecutive urine testing did not reveal the presence of mers-cov rna fig 1serological testing showed a peak igg titre during the third week of illness whilst during the fourth and fifth weeks igg titres were substantially declining igm titres were persistently elevated during the whole survey period day 13 until day 34 of illness fig 1 viral neutralisation assays performed at erasmus medical center rotterdam the netherlands confirmed the immunofluorescence testing resultsinitial and follow-up serological testing were performed on serum samples from 45 patients contacts seroconversion was revealed in one of them who developed an igg titre of 1500 and an igm titre of 1100 at 21 days after making contact with the patient this was a 63-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery heart disease and diabetes the presence of specific mers-cov antibodies was confirmed by the virus neutralisation assaycase investigation disclosed that the person who seroconverted had close contact with the first mers-cov case diagnosed in greece on 18 april 2014 he had close contact with the index case for ca 3 h and drove the index patient to the hospital on 17 april 2014 he had been identified as a close contact during the contact tracing conducted by the hellenic cdc at the time and he was submitted to the following testing according to the protocol used for the investigation of close contacts by the hellenic cdc i nasopharyngeal testing by pcr on 23 april 2014 negative ii serology testing on 23 april 2014 negative and iii serology testing on 8 may 2014 positive the patient reported developing only fever up to 385 c from 4 to 7 may 2014 without other symptoms from any other system no nasopharyngeal pcr testing was performed at the time since he was outside the incubation period of 14 days he has been well since then and during the time that he was symptomatic he only had contact with his family members four persons the initial patients wife had a brief episode of fever on 30 may 2014 oropharyngeal pcr testing was negative for mers-cov and all contacts remained seronegative on repeat testingpartial genomic sequencing 14 revealed the close phylogenetic relationship with clinical mers-cov strains associated with severe respiratory infection from patients in jeddah fig 2
in this report we further characterised serological and virological parameters of the first mers-cov case in greece rising titres of igg were demonstrated in sequential serum samples with the peak titres approximately 3 weeks into the course of the disease this is in accordance with serological testing guidance from the world health organization who recommending baseline testing from initial contact with an affected case and repeated serological testing on day 21 15 on the other hand igm titres of the patient remained constantly elevated above the threshold of detection albeit at a lower level than igg antibodies for a prolonged period of 1 month of follow-up thus isolated use of igm testing without concomitant igg determination appears not to be sufficient to reveal a recent infection it should be noted however that in the absence of detailed studies use of serological testing for mers-cov detection in humans needs to be further evaluatedprolonged shedding of the virus was noted from the respiratory tract of the patient this finding is consistent with data regarding the sars coronavirus in a report dealing with patients affected by sars prolonged shedding of the virus was noted in stool up to 126 days and respiratory specimens up to 52 days 16 data regarding the length of mers-cov excretion from different body sites are scarce 17 excretion of the virus probably depends on the amplitude of replication in different body sites the underlying immune status and co-morbidities and appropriate antiviral therapy the non-detectable viral rna in serum by day 3 after initiation of the antiviral treatment could be explained either by viral clearance in an otherwise immunocompetent person or by effectiveness of the instituted antiviral regimen literature on appropriate antiviral intervention for mers-cov is very limited and currently no evidence-based therapy exists the regimen chosen was based on the best available literature as well as evidence from animal and patient data that have been described elsewhere 2 3 4 the role of interferon therapy for mers-cov infection needs to be further elucidated an attenuated interferon- ifn- response has been described as a result of mers-cov infection 18 and extensive use of interferon-based regimens alone or in combination with ribavirin has been described for sars 4 however interferons appear to have a better antiviral effect on mers-cov compared with sars-cov in in vitro experiments 19 in vitro ifn- appears to exhibit the best anti-mers-cov effect 20 interferon activity has been enhanced by the addition of ribavirin in in vitro experiments 21 furthermore this combination has shown promising clinical and radiological effects in rhesus macaques experimentally infected with mers-cov 12 thus the clinical team elected to use this combination despite the fact that a prestigious public health agency ranks ribavirin use as not supported by high-quality evidence 5 in a more recent update published by the same public health agency the use of interferons and lopinavir is ranked under the recommendation of benefit is likely to exceed risk whereas the combination of interferon and ribavirin is ranked as data are inadequate for assessment 22 the frequent side effects of ribavirin limit its use in combination regimens for actual mers-cov-infected patients as was the experience with the current patient where liver toxicity although not definitively associated was mainly attributed to this medication the renal function deterioration of the patient described here was considered multifactorial and probably also a complication of the virus infection 23 the possibility that drug toxicity might have contributed in the renal dysfunction could not be excluded however no drug levels were measured since the patient was under continuous renal replacement therapy at that time and drug levels would be unreliable in the actual clinical human setting the combination of ribavirin and interferon has been tried with no successful outcome reported among any of the mers-cov-infected recipients 3 nevertheless the group studied consisted of severely ill patients who received this combination quite late in the course of their disease 3 lastly we added the protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir based on experience accumulated from the sars epidemic where the addition of this agent to ribavirin improved the outcome of infection 24expanding the knowledge regarding viral kinetics and the pattern of shedding especially in association with specific therapeutic interventions has important implications for infection control in the healthcare environment especially as it relates to potential transmission to other patients and healthcare workers 25phylogenetic analysis of the greek mers-cov strain showed close similarity with circulating patient viral strains from the recent jeddah outbreak as well as with a strain isolated from a dromedary camel in qatar this is in accordance with previous genetic studies that have shown identical viral strains between infected humans and dromedary camels and generated the hypothesis that dromedary camels are among the reservoirs of the virus in nature 10 26 also the presence of mers-cov-specific antibodies in camels across a wide geographic area in africa and the arabian peninsula signifies the possibility for zoonotic transmission between camels and humans 27 28 29 the potential for transmission across different individual strains should be further explored in this patient the most likely source of exposure was the hospital environment in an endemic area as his wife was hospitalised in a local hospital in jeddah 6 it appears that healthcare-associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the mers-cov epidemic in the recent upsurge 30in conclusion we describe the genetic stability of the mers-cov in a strain from the recent jeddah outbreak although reassuring this finding should not limit the level of awareness regarding the increased number of cases in the arabian peninsula reported recently and the potential evolution and more efficient transmission of the virus a who committee recently concluded that the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern have not yet been met nevertheless important gaps in current knowledge about mers-cov exist more investigations to clarify the natural reservoir and modes of transmission are necessary persistence of virus shedding in patients secretions and the effect of immune status and antiviral therapy together with the implementation of appropriate infection control measures are of paramount importance in limiting further spread of this potentially lethal virus

ethical approval not requiredfeline infectious peritonitis fip is a highly fatal and immune-mediated pyogranulomatous disease that occurs in both domestic and wild felidae the disease is caused by feline coronavirus fcov fcov is a member of the family coronaviridae genus coronavirus which is a group of enveloped and positive-stranded rna viruses antigenically and genetically coronaviruses are currently grouped into at least four groups fcov belongs to group i coronavirus which includes canine coronavirus ccov transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus and human coronavirus 229e wege et al 1982two pathotypes of fcovs are also known one is feline enteric coronavirus fecv which causes from asymptomatic infection to severe enteritis and another is feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv that causes fatal immune-mediated disease fip pedersen 1987 pedersen et al 1981 it was demonstrated that fipv arises inside of cats by mutation from infected fecv vennema et al 1998 however it is difficult to distinguish between fecv and fipv by in vitro serological and genetical methods boyle et al 1984 fiscus and teramoto 1987 pedersen et al 1984both fecv and fipv are divided into two types i and ii based on their neutralization reactivity with spike s protein-specific mabs fiscus and teramoto 1987 hohdatsu et al 1991b hohdatsu et al 1992 and sequence analysis of the s protein gene motokawa et al 1995 motokawa et al 1996 in addition to this serological property some other biological characteristics to each type have been described while fcov type i grows poorly in cell culture type ii can grow well in many different cell lines pedersen et al 1984 furthermore type ii fcov shows close antigenic and genetic relationship to ccov and tgev suggesting that fcov type ii arose from double recombination between fcov type i and ccov herrewegh et al 1998fcov type ii strains are more frequently utilized than type i strains for in vitro experiments because of higher efficient growth for serological survey of fcov infection antibody has been detected by indirect fluorescent antibody assay ifa or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using fcov pedersen 1976 scott 1979 horzinek and osterhaus 1979 ishida et al 1987 alternatively ccov or tgev are also used as a target antigen because of serological close relations to fcov however discrimination ability specificity of these methods using heterologous antigens seems to be low since they detect also cross-reactive antibodies between types i and ii such as antibody to nucleocapsid n proteinin this study we developed a plaque-reduction neutralization test prnt to serologically distinguish fcov type i and ii infections in cats and we applied it for field casesfeline whole fetus cells fcwf-4 cells which are fetal feline lung cells having characteristics of macrophages jacobse-geels and horzinek 1983 were grown in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem containing 10 fetal calf serum fcs 100 uml penicillin and 100 gml streptomycin the cells were maintained in a humidified 5 co2 incubator at 37 cfipv type i strains c3663 and yayoi and fipv type ii strains kuk-hl and m91-267 were used in this study kuk-h strain was isolated from the spleen sample of effusive form fip case in 1987 by using crfk cells and kuk-hl was plaque-purified from the kuk-h strain mochizuki et al 1997 m91-267 strain was isolated from the spleen sample taken at the postmortem examination of effusive form fip case in 1991mochizuki et al 1997 these two strains were classified into type ii by using fcov type-specific mabs kindly provided by dr t hohdatsu hohdatsu et al 1991a hohdatsu et al 1991b c3663 strain was isolated from a cat with an effusive form of fip in 1994 and used as a reference fcov type i mochizuki et al 1997 in addition it was genetically confirmed that c3663 belongs to type i fcov and m91-267 and kuk-hl do to type ii manuscript in preparation yayoi strain was isolated from liver homogenate from non-effusive form of fip by serial passage in suckling mouse brain and then in fcwf-4 cells and have been used as japanese prototype strain of fcov type i hayashi et al 1981 c3663 kuk-hl and m91-267 strains were used in subsequent experiments within 10 passages in fcwf-4 cells although the passage history of yayoi strain is unknown it was propagated less than three times in our laboratoryfour sera nos14 were collected from cats clinically diagnosed as fip and serologically identified as type i infection by indirect immunofluorescent assay using unfixed fcwf-4 cells infected with fcov type i or ii on the other hand we could not obtain any sera from naturally fcov type ii infected cats therefore two sera collected from cats experimentally infected with m91-267 or kuk-hl were used in this study mochizuki et al 1997to evaluate the seroprevalence of fcov types i and ii in japan sera were collected from 79 cats which visited to one veterinary hospital in 2004 and 2005 two of them were clinically and serologically diagnosed as fip in the hospitalserological test was performed by prnt using serum samples inactivated by heating at 56 c for 30 min the sera diluted with dmem containing 2 fcs and each virus diluted to approximately 2  103
 pfuml with dmem containing 2 fcs were equally mixed and incubated at 37 c for 1 h then 50 l of the mixture was inoculated onto fcwf-4 cells monolayer in 24-well plate sumitomo bakelite japan after absorption at 37 c 1 h the inoculum was removed and 08 agarose seaplaque agarose takara japan in growth medium was overlaid the infected cells were incubated at 37 c until cytopathic effect cpe appeared fixed with phosphate-buffered formalin and stained with crystal violet when the number of plaques was less than 75 of those in control wells the diluted sera were judged to be positive for screening of cat sera all sera finally diluted to 110 were examined for prnt the positive sera were further diluted to 133 1100 1333 11000 13333 and 110000 to determine virus-neutralizing titers the titers were expressed as the highest serum dilution showing 75 plaque reduction or moreto determine the antigenic relationship between fcov types i and ii serum samples from cats experimentally infected with fipv type ii m91-267 or kuk-hl and naturally infected with fipv type i were examined by prnt four sera from fipv type i infected cats showed vn titers to c3663 and yayoi ranging from 11000 to 116000 and those to m91-267 and kuk-hl ranging from 110 to 140 table 1
 sera collected from the experimentally fipv type ii infected cats had higher vn titers to type ii ranging from 14000 to 1128000 and lower vn titers to type i ranging from 180 to 11280 table 1 these results indicated that fcov-infected cat sera had significantly higher vn titers to homologous type but not to heterologous type therefore this prnt using both types of fcov must be able to distinguish serologically between fcov type i and ii infectionsa total of 79 cat sera collected in japan were examined for the prevalence of antibodies to fcov types i and ii by prnt using c3663 and m91-267 strains the result showed that 50 633 cats were seropositive to fcovfig 1
 among these seropositive samples 49 98 possessed significantly higher titers against type i and only one 2 did against type ii although three samples had vn titers of 133 to type ii two of them had higher vn titers to type i 13333 since one sample did not have vn titer to type i it was regarded as positive for type ii all two samples from fip cases had the highest vn titers to type i 110000 meanwhile these were negative 110 to type iiin this study we distinguished types of fcov which had infected cats by vn test at first we determined cross-reactivities of the known sera from fip cats table 1 vn titers difference between homologous type was five-fold or less and to heterologous type was 25-fold or more indicating that the present prnt can clearly differentiate fcov types it is known that a major difference between types i and ii is located in s protein responsible for eliciting vn antibodies fiscus and teramoto 1987 de groot et al 1989 corapi et al 1992using the prnt we examined the recent status of fcov seroprevalence in field cats more than 60 of the cats were found to be fcov seropositive and this was similar to the positive rate described in other countries pedersen et al 1981 loeffler et al 1978 kummrow et al 2005 bell et al 2006 in japan hohdatsu et al 1992 first described that 213 of chronically diseased cats and 134 of non-diseased cats had antibodies to fcov by ifa to detect fcov infection the seroprevalence rate obtained in the present study is about three times higher than that in the previous report since different methods and samples were used for epidemiology it is impossible to directly compare the prevalence of fcov in japan however most probable explanation for this discrepancy is that fcov has been widespreading among japanese cat population during the last decadeprevious studies conducted in several countries including japan have revealed that 6991 of sero-positive cats were suspected to be type i infection hohdatsu et al 1992 vennema 1999 kummrow et al 2005 in the present study it was found that 49 cats 98 possessed type i specific antibodies and only one cat 2 to type ii the prevalence of type i infection revealed here was significantly higher than the previous report 804 in chronically diseased cats by competitive elisa hohdatsu et al 1992 although this and the previous report hohdatsu et al 1992 were different in methods and samples it might suggest that type ii fcov infection has been decreasing in japanese domestic cats in recent yearsin conclusion our newly established vn test can specifically detect and distinguish between types of fcov infection in addition fcov type i but not type ii has widely spread among cats population in japanon september 20 2012 the first confirmed case of a new severe respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus was reported 1 2 the patient was a previously healthy male 60 years old who lived in saudi arabia and died of acute respiratory illness and renal failure 1 retrospective analysis of stored samples revealed that the novel coronavirus was also the cause of a severe respiratory disease cluster involving patients and health care professionals in jordan earlier that year 3 the isolation of the new virus from the saudi patients specimen and subsequent sequencing and detailed phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome has revealed its close relationship with bat beta-coronaviruses previously found in asia europe and africa 1 4 5 6 7 whether this emerging hcov jumped from bats directly to humans or through other animals as intermediate hosts is still unknown although the latter scenario is considered to be most likely 2 the presence of mers-cov neutralising antibodies has been detected in dromedary camels in spain oman and egypt indicating a past infection with mers-cov or a highly related virus in these camelids 8 9 the evolutionary history of coronaviruses shows evidence of recent interspecies jumps 10 11 one of the first described human coronaviruses oc43 shares a common recent ancestral history with bovine coronaviruses suggesting these viruses may have emerged from animals as well 10 in 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged and was the first known major outbreak caused by a coronavirus 12 now the emergence of mers-cov and its high fatality rate has triggered new concerns about the potential for a widespread possibly global outbreak challenges for public health are to develop strategies to control this emerging disease which include early detection of cases for with laboratory diagnosis is of crucial importancein outbreak situations especially with a novel organism causing severe human disease it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease as well as how this relates to infectivity the ability to transmit the microorganism eg virus and outcomes of laboratory tests laboratory response during the early stages of an outbreak therefore focuses on development of virologicalmicrobiological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis for contact tracing and for epidemiological studies into sources modes of transmission identification of risk groups screening of potential animal reservoirs etc however optimal use of this core laboratory capacity requires embedding of data needs for laboratory scientists within the outbreak investigations in order to obtain information needed for assay validation and correct interpretation of test outcomesfollowing the discovery of mers-cov molecular detection methods and antibody detection assays were developed by several groups and deployed internationally through an international collaborative laboratory response 13 14 15 16 however in spite of the cutting-edge technological capacity eg deep sequencing microarray technology the lack of essential information eg time of sampling profile of viraemia and shedding linked to diverse clinical manifestations severely hampers the use of these techniques in the current outbreak here we review the current knowledge on mers-cov and other human coronaviruses against data required for optimal laboratory response for the mers-covnasopharyngeal aspirates npa are the most common respiratory specimens described in the literature for molecular diagnosis of non-sars and sars coronaviruses 17 18 19 comparison of data between studies is difficult because specimen sampling is not standardised with descriptions varying from naso-pharyngeal swab naso-pharyngeal secretion throat swab nasal swab oro-nasal swab all reflecting upper respiratory tract sampling literature review shows that hcov viral loads peak at different time points during the progression of disease for non-sars cov eg hcov-nl63 peak viral loads are detected around day 12 after onset of disease with apparent clearance of infection over the course of 3 weeks in 50 of healthy children 17 20 21 for sars-cov viral loads gradually increase until day 10 6095 of patients after the onset of symptoms and then progressively decrease after day 13 4290 of patients 22 23 24 fig 1
 this comparison illustrates that even for viruses belonging to the same family using a sensitive test like rt-pcr the interpretation of a test outcome may be very different a negative reverse-transcriptase rt-pcr in a patient specimen collected early after illness onset for hcov-nl63 may be used as evidence for ruling out infection the same assay applied in an early specimen from a patient or contact with recent illness onset after sars-cov infection would most likely be false-negative as viral loads are expected to be low during this phase of illnessfor mers-cov data on respiratory shedding has only been reported anecdotally sofar all the mers-cov cases reportedly have developed a respiratory disease ranging from mild to severe pneumonia often accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards andor renal failure andor pericarditis andor disseminated intravascular coagulation dic clinical manifestations and severity of mers seem to be more similar to sars than other coronavirus infections however only one published report has provided data needed for laboratory preparedness ie on sequential sampling ct values and positive and negative test results 25 therefore at present viral shedding kinetics can only indirectly be derived fig 2a and b we plotted a timeline of available data on sampling and test outcome by day of onset symptoms for the mers-cov patients diagnosed in uk germany and france as well as some cases from saudi arabia the data suggests that shedding kinetics may be more similar to what has been observed for sars than for other human coronaviruses although very limited information is available for the latter fig 1 fig 2 the review also suggests that the use of upper respiratory specimens for mers-cov eg naso-pharyngeal swabs diagnosis may not be as sensitive as the use of lower respiratory tract specimens fig 2a and b in agreement with this viral loads were higher in samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract compared with upper respiratory tract in some mers-cov cases 25 26the difficulty in interpretation of diagnostic test results is illustrated by two secondary cases in france and in the uk respectively fig 2a patients c2 and d2 both patients were sampled early after onset of symptoms the nps specimens were positive in the uk case and negative in the french case but sputum of the latter was positive for sars although most of the samples tested were npa lower respiratory tract specimens were more often pcr positive 76 than npa 45 or other upper respiratory tract samples 24 24in sars diarrhoea was one of the most common extra-pulmonary manifestations in patients and a progressive viral load peaking around day 10 was found in 70100 of patients in stool specimens regardless respiratory symptoms fig 1 22 24 observations in children hospitalized for other hcov suggests that gastro-intestinal shedding is limited compared with sars although all four hcovs species have been detected in patient stools 32 however compared to sars there is less information about kinetics of shedding and viral loads in stools and respiratory samplesalthough the major clinical manifestations presented by mers patients are associated with the respiratory tract gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea during the course of illness were also observed quite frequently 35 25 26 27 33 this triggers questions regarding the use of stools to diagnose mers-cov again availability of data is too limited for a comparative analysis with other coronaviruses in the uae patient who was first treated in an abu dhabi hospital on march 19 and later hospitalized in germany stool samples tested borderline positive at days 12 and 16 after the onset of symptoms fig 2a patient b later stool samples from patients f from ksa and g a patient transferred from qatar to the uk were negative by rt-pcr 25 28 31 whilst diarrhoea has been listed in the clinical picture for other cases including in two separate clusters in saudi arabia no testing has been undertaken 27 34other mers patients specimens such as urine seraplasma samples and blood were very rarely tested not allowing consistent conclusions table 1
 the urine specimens tested were only from the patient transferred to germany were rt-pcr was positive on days 12 and 13 but not on day 14 after renal failure seraplasma samples collected from three patients late on disease progression 1620 days were all negative patients f c1 b rt-pcr done on blood of one french patient was positive 15 dayestablishing relevant cut-off values in tests should also take into consideration that patient groups differ with respect to age co-morbidities etc during the early stages of an outbreak investigation observations can be biased for severe disease in specific groups of patients eg older patients and with co-morbidities sofar the majority of reported mers cases have had underlying disease andor immunosuppression that could be an explanation for the higher case fatality rate 60 27 34 35 in addition delayed clearance of viral infection in such risk groups could be an alternative explanation for the prolonged shedding observed in the patients described fig 2b patients with co-morbidities more often have non-sars cov infections hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 compared with otherwise healthy patients and may shed virus for prolonged periods of time 36 37 38 39 in sars the clinical course among patients less than 12 years of age was milder and less aggressive when compared with adults and teenagers 40 41 kinetics of viral loads and the pattern of shedding can differ in these groups of patients and influence interpretation of diagnostic resultswhile clinical surveillance captures the most severe patients outbreak containment requires a full understanding of the diversity in clinical presentations including mild or asymptomatic cases assessing shedding kinetics and immunological response in this group is notoriously difficult as it requires targeted studies and willingness of healthy persons to have samples taken without proper studies it is unclear if for instance asymptomatic persons can contribute to transmission there are considerably differences among respiratory viruses in the ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections for instance among children infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus usually are associated with clinical illness in contrast with non sars covs rhinovirus and human bocavirus that are commonly found in asymptomatic children as well 42the literature on kinetics of antibodies in patients with sars-cov shows some conflicting results regarding the time of appearance of antibodies according to some reports sars-cov antibodies igg and igm are usually not detected within the first 7 days of illness but increase dramatically in the second week reaching peak igg levels within 30 days fig 1 43 44 similarly igm antibody levels increased up to 1 month and then declined gradually this profile has been observed with two different serological assays assuring that the detection levels of antibodies were not affected by sensitivity of the test other studies found specific antibodies igg igm and iga as early as 4 days after the onset of disease 45 46 igg and neutralising antibodies may persist in some patients up to 36 months although titres showed significant decline after four months 47 such data is important when planning serosurveys that may take several months to organise due to protocol design ethical clearance and planning of study logisticsthe presence of antibodies against sars-cov in individuals with no or mild symptoms has been described in healthcare workers 48 antibody levels measured in this study were highest for persons with severe illness indicating that different test cut-offs may be needed for the use of laboratory tests during public health investigations that aim to identify mild cases as well based on epidemiological investigations including serological assessment of the extent of transmission the conclusion was that only symptomatic patients were efficient spreaders of sars virus 49for mers-cov some asymptomatic infections have recently been identified in health workers and children n
  8 but whether these persons can efficiently transmit infection remains unknown 50 51 antibody detection assays have been developed but their use has been limited a retrospective study has reported serological testing by immunofluorescence assay of 2400 serum samples from persons seeking medical care at fakeeh hospital in jeddah saudi arabia where the first case of mers was diagnosed in the two previous years 1 all these patients tested negative for mers-cov whereas a patient with confirmed mers-cov infection had a clear antibody response for igg 1 some authors have explained their lack of use of serology by the fact that assays are not yet validated 34 this argument seems flawed as the same could be argued for pcr assays that are used universally with the limitations described above serological testing confirmed infection in two mers-cov patients from abu dhabi and qatar hospitalized in germany both had high titres of antibodies by ifa that were also confirmed by neutralisation tests and by micro-array testing 16 25 30 interpretation of mers-cov serology can be hampered by the widespread circulation of the four common hcovs especially by hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 which belong to the same genus of the betacoronaviruses cross-reactive antibodies have been shown between sars-cov and other coronavirus depending also on specificity of the assay 52 53according to the who guidance for health professionals patients should be evaluate for mers-cov infection if they develop pneumonia or pneumonitis and fever with a history of travel to or residence in the arabian peninsula in the 14 days before illness onset or contact with known confirmed or probable mers cases in the 14 days before illness onset 54 additionally the who recommends testing for novel coronavirus of persons including health care workers in clusters of acute respiratory infection of unknown aetiology requiring hospitalisation or where the respiratory infection is unexpectedly severeaccording to the mers case definition who revised on 3 july 2013 a confirmed case requires laboratory confirmation by molecular methods including a positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr on at least two specific genomic targets table 1 or a single positive target with sequencing on a second target 54 55 a single positive rrt-pcr without confirmation will be considered as inconclusive mers-cov laboratory test and such cases are classified as probable several molecular assays are now in widespread use and a two-step approach of screening and confirmation table 1 algorithms have been recommended by who and cdc 55 56 57 in both algorithms a screening pcr targeting a region upstream of the e gene is proposed sometimes combined with nucleocapsid n gene based pcr to enhance sensitivity for specimen screening 55 56 57 for confirmation a second assay with a different set of primers and probes is recommended table 1serological assays for testing antibodies against mers coronavirus were developed by different laboratory experts and can be used for human diagnostics as well table 2
 however no official recommendations are currently available regarding serological tests and validation has been difficult because of limited availability of human convalescent sera according to the who case definition a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity with positive serological test it will be categorised as probable case of mers-cov infection 54 whenever possible a paired acute and convalescent sera should be tested ideally combined with molecular testing of respiratory samplesas described above it is strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens are collected when possible in addition to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected the who also emphasises repeat testing as initial results may be negative specimens should be send to a reference laboratory for confirmationeach probable or confirmed case of mers should be immediately communicated to the national health authorities additionally who requests that confirmed and probable cases be reported within 24 h of being classified as such through the regional contact point for international health regulations at the appropriate who regional officeadvances in laboratory techniques over the past decades have led to a continuous improvement of laboratory preparedness for emerging infectious diseases however the lack of sufficiently detailed data accompanying patient notifications and publications is an important constraint for developing evidence-based diagnostic support to outbreak investigations to gain a better understanding of the clinical significance and epidemiology of mers-cov it is imperative to collect detailed data on sampling laboratory analyses and results combined with clinical and epidemiological data in order to improve the quality of the laboratory support during outbreaks until full validation of laboratory assays has been done the combined use of molecular and serological approaches is highly recommended acute and convalescent serum samples should be collected from each patient to help define kinetics of seroconversion that will help to confirm or rule out infection in future patients avoid misdiagnosis false negative test results due low sensitivity in an early phase of infection when antibody levels are low and to control for non-specific reactivityrs was funded by the european public health training

ecdc2013012nonenot requiredin late 2019 a cluster of patients in wuhan the capital city of chinas hubei providence were reported to be afflicted with a severe respiratory illness of unknown origin1 2 patients presented with symptoms that included high fever pneumonia dyspnea and respiratory failure the causative agent was identified to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus variant 2 sars-cov-2 the 7th coronavirus strain to infect humans to date3 and the clinical syndrome was designated coronavirus disease of 2019 covid19 the pathogenesis of covid19 is similar to previously documented respiratory distress syndromes caused by related coronaviruses including the 2005 sars coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers4 however the greater transmissibility of sars-cov-2 has enabled a swift global spread that has resulted in substantial mortality detection and tracking sars-cov-2 spread has been difficult moreover the spectrum of symptomatology observed in sars-cov-2 infection is wide ranging from asymptomatic and mild reminiscent of numerous seasonal infections including influenza and common cold viruses all the way to life-threatening respiratory failure that requires intensive care and invasive ventilation currently increased age and comorbidities are the factors most highly predictive of severe of covid19 disease5the utility of serological tests to identify individuals who have acquired antibodies against sars-cov-2 is thus recognized as both an indication of the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 infection and potentially of immunity afforded to the seropositive individual3 68 seroconversion is determined by detection of antibodies that recognize sars-cov-2 antigens coronaviruses have 4 major structural proteins spike s protein including the s1 protein and receptor binding domain rbd nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein and envelope e protein9 previous studies of sars-cov and mers found the most immunogenic antigens are the s- and n-proteins10 and development of serological tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies has focused heavily on these viral proteinsthree major platforms of serological testing have been adopted 1 enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa 2 high-throughput serological assays htsa and 3 lateral flow assays lfa elisas offer wide flexibility for research laboratories to select virtually any antigen of interest and provide highly sensitive quantitative results htsas are more suitable for clinical laboratories and offer limited antigen diversity but allow high-throughput and sensitive semi-quantitative results lfas also offer limited antigen diversity but function with small volumes 20l of whole blood plasma or sera and allow rapid 15 minutes results at the point of care the clinical community will undoubtedly employ multiple sars-cov-2 serology platforms but a comparative analysis across platforms has not been undertaken further it is currently unknown whether the detection of antibodies that bind these proteins predicts neutralizing activity or protection against infection11convalescent plasma cp transfusion has been recognized as a potential treatment for critically ill covid19 patients and the new york blood center nybc has led the first covid19 cp donation program in the united states using 370 unique cp donor samples deposited in our covid19 research repository httpsnybcorgcovid19repository we conducted elisa hsta and lfa assays as well as sars-cov-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays we find that cp donors have a wide range of antibody titers measured across multiple covid19 serological and neutralization assays notably we show that some htsa and elisa assays predict neutralizing activity in vitro and may thus serve to predict antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vivoserological analysis of the cp donors was performed using 370 unique samples collected between april and may of 2020 from the nyc area cp donors enrolled in the program were required to have tested positive for sars-cov-2 by pcr diagnostic tests and be symptom free for at least 2 weeks cp donors had a median age of 41 years 95 ci 3944 range 1775 years and showed a gaussian distribution n183 r2089 compared to the national median age of 382 years in 2018 figure 1a the frequency of male and female cp donors was 452 and 548 respectively and was not statistically different from the national average of 492 and 508 figure 1b the frequency of aborh blood group antigens was also largely consistent with the national frequency with a slightly higher number of a and o donors and slightly lower number of ab and b donors than expected figure 1c finally cp donor ethnicity was largely consistent with the national ethnic composition with a slightly higher number of multiracialother donors and lower number of blackafrican american donors than expected figure 1d overall the composition of nyc cp donors analyzed was reflective of the united states population demographicneutralization assays measure how effectively donor plasma or serum can inhibit virus infection of target cells and are the gold standard for measuring the antiviral activity of antibodies in the case of sars-cov-2 such assays require in biosafety level 3 bsl-3 facilities and highly trained personnel to overcome this limitation and expedite testing we employed pseudotyped virus assays based on either hiv-1 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or vsv vesicular stomatitis virus both viruses were engineered to lack their own envelope glycoproteins and to express a luciferase reporter gene complementation in trans with the sars-cov-2 spike s protein results in the generation of pseudotyped virus particles that are dependent on the interaction between the s protein and its receptor ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for entry into cells12 these reporter viruses were used to measure infection of human cells engineered to express ace2 hiv-s assay or expressed endogenous ace2 vsv-s assay and to determine the ability of plasma dilutions to inhibit s-dependent virus entry the nt50 values reflecting the plasma dilution at which virus infection is reduced by 50 were calculated for each sample supplementary figure 1athe neutralizing activity of cp donor samples was extremely variable and nt50 values obtained ranged from 50 to over 20000 the median nt50 values were 3901 95 ci 27834997 and 4506 95 ci 36775384 for the hiv-s or vsv-s assays respectively figure 2a and the two assays showed a high degree of correlation supplementary figure 1bc fresh frozen plasma ffp samples donated in 2019 before the sars-cov-2 outbreak were used as negative controls n10 importantly the nt50 values of all ffp samples were 50 which is the highest concentration of plasma used in the neutralization assays and is hence designated as the signal cutoff sco value overall 831 and 927 of the cp donor samples had detectable neutralization activity using hiv-s and vsv-s assays respectively figure 2b notably 112 and 87 of cp donors had nt50 values at or greater than 2000 40-fold over sco using hiv-s and vsv-s assays respectively while 558 and 52 of cp donors had nt50 values at or less than 500 10-fold over sco figure 2b thus the majority of cp donors may have relatively modest neutralizing activity and a small proportion of donors have high neutralization activitynt50 values were not statistically different between blood groups figure 2e supplementary figure 1g or age groups figure 2c supplementary figure 1e and there was no linear correlation of nt50 values with age supplementary figure 1d in contrast to previous reports13 however in agreement with recent studies14 nt50 values of male cp donor samples were 17-fold higher than those from female cp donors using hiv-s and vsv-s assays figure 2d and supplementary figure 1f n  195 p  0009 and 0001 median difference 217 and 197 respectively for cp donors where symptom dates were reported the time between last symptom and the date of donation was calculated interestingly cp donors 23 weeks post symptoms had a statistically significant increase in nt50 values compared to cp donors 3 weeks post-symptom figure 2f and supplementary figure 1h n52 p  003 and 004 median difference 426 and 226 respectively overall these data suggest cp donors possess a wide range of neutralizing antibody levels that are proportionately distributed across demographic categories with the exception of a small sex-dependent effectmultiple platforms have been deployed to detect seroconversion against sars-cov-2 the simplest tests are lfas which solubilize antibodies from whole blood plasma or sera in an aqueous mobile phase which moves across a nitrocellulose membrane coated with anti-human igg andor igm to distinguish between specific classes of immunoglobins while a control band ensures test function binding of antibodies to antigen-conjugated enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase generates a colored band at the test lines analysis of 144 cp donor samples showed that only 794 of cp donors tested positive for sars-cov-2-specfic igg antibodies and 248 for igm antibodies figure 3a top while lfas are not designed to perform quantitatively large discrepancies in band intensity between donors supplementary figure 2a is often presumed to indicate semi-quantitative results we performed densitometric analysis of the test bands from lfa cassettes supplementary figure 2b 2c and normalized each test to control band intensity lfas showed an intensity range of 0 - 992 for igg bands and 0 - 185 for igm bands with a median intensity of 20 for igg and 1 for igm figure 3a bottom thus lfas have a high degree of variation in band intensity within the cp donor populationhtsa systems offer the advantage of performing semi-quantitative seroconversion assays using clinical laboratory testing infrastructure at large scale we performed the ortho-clinical diagnostics vitros sars-cov-2 total ig assay and the abbott labs architect sars-cov-2 igg assay using over 300 cp donor plasma samples we found 964 and 914 of cp donor samples were positive using the ortho and abbott platforms respectively figure 3b the median value of cp samples using the ortho assay was 101 arbitrary units au n333 95 ci 785  123 sco  1 while that of ffp healthy controls was 001 au n8 95 ci 001  002 for the abbott assay the median value of cp samples was 604 au n315 95 ci 548  644 sco  14 while that of ffp healthy controls was 002 au 95 ci 001  015 these results clearly demonstrate a wide variation in antibody levels detected using htsa platforms in the cp donor population but greater sensitivity than lfa assaysthe gold standard for quantification of antigen-specific antibodies is elisa assays studies of antibody responses during sars-cov and mers outbreaks identified the s- and n-proteins as the dominant antigens therefore we designed three indirect elisa assays using sars-cov-2 recombinant his-tagged spike protein s1 domain s1 spike protein rbd domain rbd and nucleocapsid protein n we utilized monoclonal antibodies demonstrated to bind antigen in a dose-dependent manner to generate standard curves from which antibody concentrations were calculated and ffp from healthy controls to determine signal cutoffs these elisa assays showed that 852 891 and 963 of cp donor samples were positive for antibodies against s1 rbd and n antigens respectively figure 3c in the s1 elisa the median value for cp donor samples was 445gml n285 95 ci 342  536gml sco  120gml and for ffp controls 1009gml n10 95 ci 78  120gml in the np elisa the median value for cp donor samples was 6432gml n271 95 ci 2811  13792gml sco  700gml while in the rbd elisa the median value of cp donor samples was 156gml n43 95 ci 1255  256gml sco  4gml notably the range of s1 and np-binding antibody concentrations observed in the elisas was extreme constituting a 1000-fold difference in titers within the cp donor population taken together these data demonstrate that cp donors have a wide range of concentrations of antibodies specific to immunogenic sars-cov-2 antigens as measured across multiple serological platformsit is not logistically feasible to implement neutralization assays as a measurement of antiviral antibodies at a scale of the general population while quantification of seroconversion is practiced controlled studies that determine the relationship between quantitative sars-cov-2 serology test results and neutralizing activity is sparse we examined the correlation between serology and neutralization assays in the cp donor samples figure 4a supplementary figure 3 4c as expected s1 elisa titers showed a significant linear correlation with nt50 values r2  035 while the rbd elisa titers showed slightly higher linearity r2  042 commensurate with the fact that the rbd is a key target for neutralizing antibodies conversely np elisa titers showed a comparatively low degree of linear correlation with neutralization activity r2  009 by comparison the ortho htsa total ig assay correlated well r2  044 while the abbott htsa igg assay correlated less with neutralization activity r2  024 lfa igg densitometry measurements showed the poorest correlation with neutralization activity r2  022correlation between serological results and neutralization activity was also examined using the non-parametric spearman test that does not assume linear dependence figure 4b as expected a high correlation between the hiv-s and vsv-s neutralization assays was obtained r089 the ortho and abbott htsa platforms exhibited the highest degree of correlation with neutralization among the serology assays tested r  075 and 072 respectively for the hiv-s assay 070 and 069 for the vsv-s assay the s1 rbd and np elisas also showed a high degree of correlation particularly with the hiv-s neutralization assay r  069 065 and 065 while the lfa igg and igm assay showed the poorest correlation r  056 041 taken together the data demonstrate that all quantitative serological assays correlate to some degree with neutralization activity however the htsa and s1 elisa assays have the highest predictive value as a surrogate for pseudovirus neutralization assays importantly correlation between htsa scores and nt50 values suggest presumptive ranges of neutralizing activity based on ranges of htsa values figure 4c supplementary figure 4awhile elisa assays revealed s1 and n antibody titers correlated with each other these titers were not always proportional among cp donor samples to examine the coincidence of s1 and np antibody titers and using ffp plasma samples as negative controls we categorized s1 and n antibody titers that fell below sco values as negative and titers greater 10-fold over sco as high supplementary figure 4b using 241 cp donor samples that were assayed with both the s1 and n elisa assays we found that 81 of donors were double positive dp while 16 of samples were single positive 14 n and 2 s1 respectively figure 4d only 25 of cp donors were double negative for s1 and np antibodies within the double positive population we found that 23 of samples were dphigh while 5 and 30 of samples were either s1high or nhigh while the remaining 42 were dplow we then examined the distribution of nt50 values from the hiv-s neutralization assay within these populations figure 4e notably dn samples showed nt50 values at the sco observed for ffp healthy control samples while dplow samples had relatively low nt50 values median value 327 95 ci 186  444 importantly the dphigh donors had nt50 values that were 7-fold higher than dplow donors median value 2130 additionally nt50 values in the the nhigh and s1high groups were 25- and 4-fold higher than those of the dplow groupfinally we sought to determine if the frequency of peripheral blood immune cells varied as a function of antibody titer we stained peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs isolated from cp donor buffy coats for classical surface markers associated with b-cell or t-cell populations supplementary figure 5a 5b while we found statistically significant differences in nave cd4 and cd8 t-cell populations in donors with high s1 elisa titers compared to those with low titer we did not observe substantial differences in b or t cell populations that could plausibly explain the large differences in antibody titers or neutralization activity that was observed in cp donors supplementary figure 5cquantification of antiviral antibodies in recovered individuals is an important metric for determining population immunity conferred by exposure to sars-cov-2 our study suggests that most new york city convalescent plasma donors have antibodies against sars-cov-2 indeed our data demonstrate that the htsa including the ortho and abbot assays which have received fda emergency use authorization are well suited to detect a wide range of antibody titers in the population and can detect antibodies in 964 and 9143 of recovered patients respectively lfas performed less well and individuals with low antibody titers scored weakly positive or negative in lfas such outcomes could be interpreted incorrectly thus increasing the rate of false negative results ultimately studies that accurately document sars-cov-2 seroprevalence in diverse populations will require highly sensitive high quality assays such as hsta or elisa to be reliableour results are consistent with previous publications that show a considerable range in antibody titers in recovered covid19 patients15 however our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the correlation of quantitative serological test values with neutralization activity importantly high dynamic range serological assays such as the htsa and s1 elisa had a significant linear correlation with neutralization activity this knowledge is necessary for deriving potential serologic correlates of protection16 and may aid in predicting immunity at the individual and population levels14 however the levels of plasma neutralizing activity required to prevent sars-cov-2 re-infection are currently unknown indeed anecdotal results have been reported for seasonal coronavirus experimental infection studies for example one study of 229e hcov found a positive correlation between pre-infection antibody titer and neutralization activity with symptom clinical severity17 in another study 7 of 8 individuals with low neutralizing titers excreted virus upon re-exposure compared to only 1 of 4 subjects with higher titers18 however the conclusions of these studies are not directly comparable to the current sars-cov-2 pandemic as such the necessity of human epidemiological or vaccination studies are necessary to determine the minimum threshold of neutralizing activity necessary to prevent sars-cov-2 re-infection conversely sub-neutralizing antibody levels have been reported to facilitate rather than inhibit viral entry of the some coronaviruses in vitro through antibody dependent enhancement ade1921 while ade dependent replication has not been demonstrated to occur in sars-cov viral uptake into macrophages via antibody association with fc receptors does induce il-6 and tnf cytokines which may promote inflammation and tissue damage22 insights gained from an accurate analysis of antibody levels and neutralization activity in sars-cov-2-infected individuals will help address these important questions and the corresponding health consequencesa key biological question is what underlies the large variation in antibody titers neutralizing or otherwise observed in cp donors numerous variables including the effectiveness of innate immune reposes sars-cov-2 exposure dose anatomical site of initial infection and partial cross-reactive immunity conferred by prior seasonal coronavirus infection could all impart variation on the amount and dissemination of sars-cov-2 antigen variation in the exposure of the adaptive immune system to sars-cov-2 antigen would in turn likely impact the magnitude of immune responses our observation that the levels of antibody to n as well as s correlates with s-specific neutralizing titer suggests that quantitative differences in the overall adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 rather than intrinsic differences in the ability of individuals to mount neutralizing responses at least partly explains the large variation in neutralizing capacity of cp this notion is consistent with recent findings that all individuals examined generated very similar potent monoclonal sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies but at very different levels14the development of efficacious vaccines against sars-cov-2 may be necessary for ending the covid19 pandemic clinical trials will undoubtedly include a battery of serological and neutralization assays in test subjects to assess candidate vaccine efficacy surrogate serology tests to neutralizing activity could help to rapidly inform as to the likely effectiveness as well as immunogenicity of vaccines against sars-cov-2 to this end real-time analyses using scalable htsa testing platforms is effectuate while future studies are conducted to more precisely measure in vivo neutralization activityfinally the utility of convalescent plasma in the treatment of infection has been recognized since the turn of the 20th century23 cp transfusion is thought to be effective through passive immunization specifically the transfer of neutralizing antibodies from a recovered individual to another individual manifesting life-threatening symptoms24 25 previously cp therapy has been used to treat both sars and mers26 and currently can be rapidly deployed against sars-cov-2 while other therapies are under development27 nevertheless many questions remain regarding the optimal antibody levels necessary to treat patients at varying stages of covid19 disease accurate quantification using serological assays that predict neutralization activity may improve clinical outcomes through refinement of cp unit selection for patients of varying symptomatology in summary we demonstrate that htsa and s1 elisa assays show the strongest correlation with neutralization activity and may serve to predict the degree of antiviral antibody activity present in recovered patients or vaccine recipientshuh75 cells were a gift from charles rice28 the 293tace2cl13 cell clone was generated by transducing 293t cells atcc crl-3216 with a csib-based ace2 lentivirus expression

3355-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate the absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm and we set the cutoff value at 6 sd above the mean value for the negative cohortserum samples were previously tested for antibodies against s1 of different coronaviruses we used a protein microassay that has been described 6we analyzed the correlations between antibody responses detected by different elisas and those detected by prnt which is the standard for coronavirus serologic analysis we used graphpad prism version 8 httpswwwgraphpadcom for this analysiswe evaluated sars-cov-2specific antibody responses in severe and mild cases by using serum samples collected at different times postonset of disease from 3 pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients from france we tested serum samples for sars-cov-2specific antibodies by using different elisas after infection all 3 patients seroconverted between days 13 and 21 after onset of disease figure 1 and antibodies were elicited against the sars-cov-2 s s1 subunit and rbd but only 23 patients had detectable antibodies to the n-terminal s1a domain because the n protein of sars-cov-2 is 90 similar to that of sars-cov table 2 we used sars-cov n protein as an antigen to test for sars-cov-2 n proteindirected antibodies in an elisa format we found that antibodies were elicited against the n protein in all three patients when tested in a prnt serum samples from all three patients neutralized sars-cov-2 infection antibody responses detected by different assays correlated strongly with neutralizing antibody responses figure 2 we observed cross-reactivity with the sars-cov s and s1 proteins and to a lower extent with mers-cov s protein but not with the mers-cov s1 protein figure 1 panels g h this finding was evident from analyzing the degree of similarity of the different coronavirus s protein domains to their corresponding sars-cov-2 proteins table 2 this analysis showed that the s2 subunit is more conserved and thus plays a role in the cross-reactivity seen when the whole s was used as antigen thus s1 is more specific than s as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serologic diagnosiswe further assessed the specificity of the s1 assay by using cohorts ae table 1 which were composed of serum samples from healthy blood donors a pcr-confirmed acute respiratory non-cov infections b acute-phase and convalescent-phase pcr-confirmed - and -hcov infections c pcr-confirmed mers-cov infections d and pcr-confirmed sars-cov infections e none of the serum samples from specificity cohorts ad were reactive in our in-house s1 elisa at the set cutoff value indicating 100 specificity whereas serum samples from sars-cov patients cross-reacted figure 3 panel a the specificity of s1 as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serologic analysis was further supported by the fact that 87100 of serum samples in cohorts ac included in this study were seropositive for endemic hcovs hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e as determined by the s1 protein microarray figure 3 panel b nonetheless all serum samples were seronegative for sars-cov and mers-covusing the same cohort we also validated the specificity of the n protein igg and rbd igg elisas for detecting sars-cov-2specific antibodies at the set cutoff except for serum samples from sars-cov patients none of the control serum samples was positive for rbd antibodies and 1 mers-covpositive serum sample was weakly positive for n protein antibodies figure 3 panels c d we also detected seroconversion among the 3 patients with covid-19 because serum samples from the 3 patients were collected at a limited number of time points it was difficult to accurately assess time for seroconversion to accurately assess time of seroconversion a larger number of longitudinal samples is needed overall these validated elisas for different antigens can be useful for epidemiologic studies and for evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responsesnext we validated the sensitivity and specificity of 2 commercial elisa kits for detecting s1-specific igg and iga by using the same cohort table 1 figure 4 all 3 covid-19 patients had reactive antibodies detected by the igg 610 serum samples and iga 710 serum samples elisas figure 4 we also detected reactivity of serum samples from the validation cohorts ad 11203 for iga and 8203 for igg elisas serum samples from 2 patients infected with hcov-oc43 a betacoronavirus were reactive in both igg and iga elisa kits we have reported the cross-reactivity of these serum samples in a mers-cov s1 igg elisa kit 6 we confirmed the cross-reactivity of the 2 serum samples by testing 12 serum samples from both patients that were collected at different time points pre-oc43 and post-oc43 infection although all preinfection serum samples were negative all postinfection serum samples were reactive in the igg and iga elisas further validation was also made in a different laboratory by using 31 serum samples collected from 9 covid-19 patients in germany r wlfel et al unpub data httpsdoiorg1011012020030520030502 at different time points 323 days after disease onset a specificity cohort composed of 18 serum samples from persons infected with hcov 4 samples from persons infected with hcov-229e 3 from persons infected with hcov-hku1 4 from persons infected with hcov-nl63 and 7 from persons infected with hcov-oc43 and 3 serum samples from persons infected with mers-cov and 3 samples from persons infected with sars-cov whose samples were collected 456 days after onset of disease onset figure 5 all 9 covid-19 patients were previously confirmed to seroconvert at days 615 after onset of disease by use of a recombinant immunofluorescence test and prnt a total of 89 seroconverted patients showed reactivity above the implemented cutoff values in the igg and iga elisa a serum sample from 1 patient figure 5 panels a b had an antibody level slightly below the cutoff value which might be explained by an overall reduced antibody response of this patient prnt90  10 overall the iga-based elisa kit was more sensitive but less specific than the igg-based elisa kitfinally we compared the performance of different elisas for detection of antibodies among pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients with that of prnt which is the standard for coronavirus serologic analysis tables 3 4 the prnt50 correlated strongly with different elisas the commercial iga elisa showed the strongest correlation followed by the s and n elisa which indicated their capacity to detect sars-cov-2specific antibodies however a larger patient cohort is needed to assess the sensitivities of these platformsvalidated sars-cov-2 serologic assays are urgently needed for contact tracing epidemiologic and vaccine evaluation studies because the n and s proteins are the main immunogenic coronavirus proteins we developed elisa-based assays that were able to detect antibodies to these 2 proteins and to the 2 s domains s1a and rbd results for these assays correlated strongly with results of the prnt50 because most humans have antibodies against the 4 endemic human coronaviruses it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false-positive results in addition the 2 zoonotic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov are also betacoronaviruses increasing the potential for cross-reactivity among the s antigens tested s1 was more specific than s in detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies as mers-cov s cross-reactive antibodies were detected in serum of 1 of the covid-19 patients which was not seen when mers-cov s1 was used for testing this finding could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the coronavirus s2 subunit relative to s1 table 2 therefore consistent with our earlier findings for serologic analysis of mers-cov 6 s1 is a specific antigen for sars-cov-2 diagnosticswhen testing the specificity of s1 or its rbd for detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies none of the serum samples from the validation cohorts ae showed any reactivity except for serum samples from patients with sars-cov this finding is not unexpected because cross-reactivity resulted from the high degree of similarity between s1 and rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 table 2 however sars-cov has not circulated in the human population since 2003 ie 17 years ago and an earlier study reported waning of sars-covspecific antibodies which made them undetectable in 21 91 of 23 serum samples tested 6 years after infection 11 it is therefore unlikely that antibodies to this virus are present in the population and thus it is unlikely that false-positives results are caused by reactivity of sars-cov antibodieswe used the high degree of similarity between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteins to develop a new in-house n protein elisa in which we used sars-cov n protein 90 similar to sars-cov-2 n protein as antigen the n protein elisa could detect sars-cov-2specific antibodies with high specificity and sensitivity using the 3 different validated elisas we found that antibody levels were higher after severe infection than after mild infections similar findings have been reported earlier for mers-cov 1213 however this finding needs to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients with various degrees of disease severity and it highlights the potential need for a sensitive assay to avoid missing persons who have milder infections in epidemiologic studiesin addition igg seroconversion can be reliably confirmed in the second week after disease onset however because of the limited number of longitudinal serum samples from covid-19 patients tested by the in-house assays it was difficult to accurately assess time for seroconversion for this assessment a larger number of longitudinal samples is needed in the 3 in-house elisas tested the rbd and n protein elisas were more sensitive than s1 elisa in detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and showed stronger correlations with prnt50 titers therefore detecting antibodies against 2 different antigens might be needed to confirm the findings and avoid false-negative results in surveillance studies however the sensitivities of the assays need to be further validated with a larger cohortwe validated -versions of iga and s1 igg commercial elisas in 2 different laboratories the iga-based elisa showed higher sensitivity than the igg-based elisa whereas the igg elisa showed higher specificity than the iga elisa although the iga and igg assays can be used for serologic diagnosis igg is longer lived 14 and thus is preferred for serosurveillance studies we observed some cross-reactivity in both elisas with serum samples from the same 2 hcov-oc43 patients in which these samples showed cross-reactivity in a mers-cov s1 igg elisa 6 despite the different antigen used this finding indicates a response to another protein that could be in the blocking or coating matrix apart from the specific antigen coated resulting in this consistent false-positive resultoverall the assays developed and validated in this study could be instrumental for patient contact tracing serosurveillance studies and vaccine evaluation studies however because various studies will be conducted in different laboratories it is crucial to calibrate and standardize assays developed by different laboratories by using well-defined standard references as part of diagnostic assay validation this standardization is not only needed to reduce interassay variability but to also correlate results obtained from different laboratories that use various assays 15 this correlation is crucial for better comparison and interpretation of results from different studies evaluating vaccine trials enabling uniform assessment of immunogenicity efficacy and better understanding of correlates of immune protection 16 thus setting up reference panels is a vital element in our preparedness approaches to emerging virusesin france the

using all the data the global sensitivity specificity ppv and npv were determined to be 911 950 897 and 957 respectively table 3
out of the 43 flocks 18 were classified as free of any salmonella serovar among them 16 four flocks of laying hens and 12 flocks of breeding hens were found serologically negative during the whole surveillance period two flocks of breeding hens were serologically tested positive from the beginning of the animal economic life onefive positive out of 20 samples however neither the routine bacteriological samples nor the additional ones collected because of the discordance between bacteriological and serological results allowed us to detect any salmonella serovarout of the 43 flocks 18 were infected with serovars different from se and st table 4
 these flocks were infected with serovars sharing groups 1 and 2 or not groups 3 and 4 common somatic antigens with se or st four flocks were continually infected with s heidelberg or s agona both serovars belonging to the same serogroup as st and were serologically positive group 2 among the flocks infected with salmonella serovars which did not share any common somatic antigens with se or st the only three seropositive flocks group 4 were infected with s hadar
s enteritidis was found in two flocks of breeding hens and two flocks of laying hens for the first breeder flock the bacteriological and serological results were negative until s enteritidis was found in the hatchery where the eggs of this flock were incubated after examinations of organs from 60 hens s enteritidis was detected in a group of five organs consequently the hens of this flock were prematurely slaughtered in accordance with the french legislation anonymous 1998 for the second breeder flock se was isolated only once on the environmental swab the other bacteriological and serological samples remained negative until the end of the economic life the two salmonella enteritidis infected laying hen flocks were related to human food poisoning these flocks were belatedly included in our study at 50 weeks of age this explains why serological examinations were only performed from that time whereas bacteriological results were available from 40 weeks of age table 5
 these two flocks were located on the same farm the first one was bacteriologically and serologically positive at 50 weeks of age the second flock was serologically negative but bacteriologically positive at 50 weeks but positive serological results were then detected at 56 weeks at the end of production bacteriological and serological results were concordant for both flocks
s typhimurium was detected at the end of the economic life in three flocks of laying hens for two of them positive serological results were inconsistently detected table 6
in experimental conditions this elisa showed a sensitivity greater than 90 calculated by use of sera obtained after inoculation of hens with se or st the level of the serological response was correlated to the inoculation dosethe specificity of this serological method was 95 in experimental conditions but decreased to 75 in the field study indeed out of the 36 flocks without se or st nine were seropositive so this elisa was not specific for se or st as sera from conventional animals raised in batteries and in contact with various serovars were found positive some of these serovars share common antigens with se or st like s agona and s heidelberg but others do not like s hadar differences in stimulation of the immune system may also be related to the invasive potential of each strain desmidt et al 1998 roy et al 2001 these three serovars isolated in our study from breeder flocks were also probably transmitted via the eggshells to the progeny in the hatchery indeed the owners of the breeder flocks infected with s heidelberg and s hadar involved in this study table 4 reported that the corresponding broiler flocks were frequently infected with the same serovars positive serological reactions may also be explained by the possible presence of se or st hidden by other serovars in the same sample as described by van winsen et al 1999 on artificially infected pigs the serovars agona heidelberg and hadar are not currently included in the french legislation although they have not the same importance as se and st in food poisoning outbreaks related to these three serovars are reported in different countries synnott et al 1998 bisbini et al 2000 van look et al 2000 lindqvist et al 2002 demczuk et al 2003 hennessy et al 2004the two seropositive flocks with negative bacteriological results routine and additional examinations could be explained by a non-specific response of the elisa or a possible antimicrobial treatment desmidt et al 1996 feld et al 2000in flocks infected with se or st the bacteriological examination was found positive before the elisa the difference was probably related to the delay in the transmission of salmonella within the flock and the immune response of the birds skov et al 2002 this phenomenon was particularly observed for one of the laying hen flocks infected with se table 5 flock 2 se was also recovered in two flocks of breeding hens but apparently without massive infection of the birds since the serological results in these two flocks were always negative in one of the flocks infected with st table 6 flock 1 there were several consecutive positive bacteriological results but only one positive serological result in this flock st was probably established in the environment without a large infection of the hens at the time of slaughtering with regards to the second flock infected with st the absence of positive serological results could be explained by the slaughtering of the hens before the infection of birds occurred in the third flock the serology became positive 1 month after the first detection of st by bacteriological method this result could not be confirmed because the flock reached the end of its economic life and the hens had to be slaughteredon a national basis the use of this elisa for the detection of flocks recently infected with salmonella could not be recommended indeed it may induce a delayed elimination of positive flocks and so may contribute to food poisoning and environmental dissemination of salmonellanevertheless serology remains interesting to survey a large scale of poultry flocks because of its possible automation low cost and ability to detect chronic infections without salmonella excretion cooper et al 1989 hassan et al 1990 nicholas and cullen 1991 barrow 1992 barrow 1994 desmidt et al 1996 skov et al 2002 if a country decides to use a serological method in its surveillance system a positive response in a flock without any vaccination against salmonella will need further bacteriological examination this confirmation remains necessary because of a possible non-specific response of the elisa which may lead to an unjustified chicken slaughtering and an economic loss for the farmer the bacteriological confirmation is also necessary for epidemiological reasons skov et al 2002 and regulations enteritidis and typhimurium are currently the only two serovars targeted by the french authorities other serovars could be targeted since the european regulation 21602003 anonymous 2003 consequently the bacteriological examination is still more suitable than our elisa to follow the evolution of the legislationfor a recent infection of chicken flocks with se and st the bacteriological method currently used in france seem to be an earlier and a more reliable indicator than the elisa used in this study further investigations are necessary with chronic infected flocks and hens vaccinated against salmonella so for the time being the french national surveillance of s enteritidis and s typhimurium in breeder and layer flocks of gallus gallus species should remain entirely based on bacteriological examinationsaccurate and rapid diagnostic tests will be critical for achieving control of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 diagnostic

2 changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course3 and precarious availability of test materials4 serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to rt-pcr in the diagnosis of acute infection as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care a clear advantage of these tests over rt-pcr is that they can identify individuals previously infected by sars-cov-2 even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill as such serological tests could be deployed as surveillance tools to better understand the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 and potentially inform individual risk of future diseasemany serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period including some marketed for use as rapid point-of-care tests the pace of development has however exceeded that of rigorous evaluation and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains5 we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for sars-cov-2 infection our objectives were to evaluate the quality of the available evidence to compare pooled sensitivities and specificities of different test methods and to identify study test and patient characteristics associated with test accuracyour systematic review and meta-analysis is reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines6 see supplementary file we searched ovid-medline for studies published in 2020 with no restrictions on language subject headingssubheadings when applicable combined with text words were used for the concepts of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 and serological tests the supplementary file provides the complete search strategy run on 6 april 2020 and repeated on 30 april 2020 to identify pre-peer reviewed preprints studies we searched the entire list of covid-19 preprints from medrxiv and biorxiv httpsconnectmedrxivorgrelatecontent181 initially on 4 april 2020 and again on 28 april 2020 we also considered articles referred by colleagues or identified in references of included studieseligible studies were randomised trials cohort or case-control studies and case series reporting the sensitivity or specificity or both of a serological test for covid-19 we excluded review articles editorials case reports modelling or economic studies articles with sample sizes less than five and studies that only reported analytical sensitivity ie dilutional identification of detection limits7 three investigators mb gt fak independently screened titles and abstracts and two mb gt independently screened full text papers we used a sensitive screening strategy at the title or abstract level wherein selection by a single reviewer was sufficient for a study to undergo full text review a third reviewer fak resolved disagreements between reviewers at the full text stage in the systematic review and meta-analyses we included studies when sensitivity or specificity or both of at least one covid-19 serological test was measured against a reference standard of viral culture or rt-pcrin our primary analysis we estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity by method of serological test we expected that accuracy would be associated with the immunoglobulin class being measured as is the case for other coronaviruses8

figure 2 summarises the quadas-2 assessment and supplementary figure s1 displays each of the 49 individual quadas-2 evaluations for the patient selection domain a high or unclear risk of bias was seen in 98 4849 of quadas-2 assessments mostly related to a case-control design and not using consecutive or random sampling for the index test domain 73 3649 of assessments concluded a high or unclear risk of bias because it was not clear whether the serological test was interpreted blind to the reference standard or whether the cut-off values for classifying results as positive negative or indeterminate were prespecified for lfias 18 of the quadas-2 assessments when test results are subjectively interpreted by a human reader eg appearance of a line a description of the number of readers and assessment of reliability were provided in 17 318 of assessments for the reference standard domain we judged the risk of bias as unclear in 94 4649 of assessments owing to inadequate details about specimens used for rt-pcr or use of specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs we also classified the risk as unclear if fewer than two rt-pcrs were used to rule out infection or if the number was not reported risk of bias from flow and timing was high or unclear in 67 3349 owing to missing information or results not stratified by the timing of sample collection in relation to symptom onset major applicability concerns for the index test were seen in 29 1449 of assessments mostly owing to lfia being performed in laboratories and not using point-of-care type specimens
table 3 enumerates within study and pooled sensitivity stratified by test type and immunoglobulin class within each test method clia elisa lfia point estimates were similar between the different types of immunoglobulins and confidence intervals overlapped within each class of immunoglobulin sensitivity was lowest for the lfia method table 4 reports on specificity pooled specificities ranged from 966 95 confidence interval 943 to 982 for lfias measuring igm and igg to 997 990 to 100 for elisas measuring igm pooled specificity for clia tests that measured igm and igg n2 could not be estimated because of non-convergence for all test methods and immunoglobulin classes visual inspection of summary roc curves supplementary figure s2 and of forest plots supplementary figure s3 showed important heterogeneitysupplementary table s5 provides sensitivity and specificity reported in three studies that used serological test methods other than elisas lfias or clias sensitivity or specificity or both were low for all with the exception of an igm enzyme immunoassay in one arm of 16 patients supplementary table s6 reports sensitivity and specificity of serological tests that measured iga one elisa one clia47

51 all four studies were classified as high risk of bias from patient selection and unclear risk of bias from performance of the reference standard and three had high or unclear risk of bias in the domains of index test performance and flow and timing supplementary figure s1 sensitivity ranged from 931 to 986 and specificity from 933 to 100
table 5 reports stratified meta-analyses for evaluating potential sources of heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity peer review was not associated with accuracy for elisas and lfias accuracy estimates at the sample level ie in studies when it was possible for patients to contribute more than one sample to the analysis were similar to estimates using only one sample for each patient for clias specificity was higher from studies reported at the sample level point estimates for pooled sensitivity and specificity were higher when both surface and nucleocapsid proteins were used although confidence intervals overlapped point estimates of pooled sensitivity were lower for commercial kits versus in-house assays for all three methods with the strongest difference seen for lfias where the sensitivity of commercial kits was 650 490 to 782 and that of non-commercial tests was 882 836 to 913 for all three test methods pooled specificity was high when measured in populations where covid-19 was not suspected regardless of whether the sampling had been done before or during the epidemic for both lfias and clias pooled specificity was lower among individuals with suspected covid-19 compared with other groups similar data were not available for elisas for lfias specificity was lower when estimated in individuals with other viral infections but this was not the case for elisas or clias
table 6 shows pooled sensitivity stratified by the timing of sample collection in relation to symptom onset regardless of immunoglobulin class or test method pooled sensitivity was lowest in the first week of symptom onset and highest in the third week or later data on specificity stratified by timing were not available
table 7 provides a summary of our main findings with examples of hypothetical testing outcomes for 1000 people undergoing serological testing in settings with a prevalence of sars-cov-2 ranging from 5 10 and 20 for example in a population with a true sars-cov-2 prevalence of 10 for every 1000 people tested with an lfia among those who had covid-19 66 will test positive and 34 will be incorrectly classified as uninfected among those without covid-19 869 will test negative and 31 will be incorrectly classified as having antibodies to sars-cov-2the utility of a low cost rapid and accurate point-of-care test55 has spurred the development and marketing of several covid-19 lfia serological tests56 we found only two studies where lfia had been performed at the point of care the low sensitivity of lfia is of particular concern given that most studies used sample preparation steps that are likely to increase sensitivity compared with the use of whole blood as would be done at the point of care these observations argue against the use of lfia serological tests for covid-19 beyond research and evaluation purposes and support interim recommendations issued by the world health organization57
cautious interpretation of specificity estimates is warranted for several reasons importantly few data were available from people who were tested because of suspected sars-cov-2 infection hence our overall pooled estimates might not be generalisable to people who need testing because of covid-19 symptoms for clias the lower specificity among people with suspected covid-19 could be a spurious finding from a false negative rt-pcr result given that the specificity for clias was high among people with confirmed other viral infections by contrast for lfias other viral infections could have contributed to the lower specificity in suspected covid-19our time stratified analyses suggest that current serological tests for covid-19 have limited utility in the diagnosis of acute covid-19 for example of those tested for covid-19 within one week of symptom onset on average 44 to 87 will be falsely identified as not having infection and while sensitivity estimates were higher in the third week or later even at this time point we found important false negative rates for example in people with covid-19 who are tested three weeks after symptom onset elisa igg will misclassify 18 as not having been infected and lfia igg will misclassify 30overall the poor performance of existing serological tests for covid-19 raises questions about the utility of using such methods for medical decision making particularly given time and effort required to do these tests and the challenging workloads many clinics are facing our findings should also give pause to governments that are contemplating the use of serological testsin particular point-of-care teststo issue immunity certificates or passports for example if an lfia is applied to a population with a true sars-cov-2 prevalence of 10 for every 1000 people tested 31 who never had covid-19 will be incorrectly told they are immune and 34 people who had covid-19 will be incorrectly told that they were never infectedour review has several strengths we used sensitive search strategies and included pre-peer reviewed literature and although our use of studies published as preprints might be criticised we found that the peer reviewed literature also had biases moreover preprints have taken an unprecedented larger role58 in discussions and policy making around covid-19hence the importance of subjecting pre-peer reviewed literature to critical appraisal another strength of our review was that two independent reviewers systematically assessed potential sources of bias finally a second investigator verified all data extractionour study also has some limitations most importantly we compared pooled estimates between different study populations as such the possibility of confounding exists eg from differences in timing of sampling between studies explaining differences in sensitivity or specificity59 this approach was taken because few studies performed head-to-head comparisons we did not perform metaregression as many studies would have been excluded owing to limited reporting of covariates another limitation is that as we did not search embase we might have missed some published studiesfuture studies to evaluate serological tests for covid-19 should be designed to overcome the major limitations of the existing evidence base this can be readily accomplished by adhering to the fundamentals of the design for diagnostic accuracy studies a well defined use-case ie specific purpose for which the test is being used consecutive sampling of the target population within the target use-case performance of the index test in a standardised and blinded manner using the same methods that will be applied in the specialty and ensuring the reference test is accurate performed on all participants and interpreted blind to the results of the index test to reduce the likelihood of misclassification the reference standard should consist of rt-pcr performed on at least two consecutive specimens and when feasible include viral cultures to reduce variability in estimates and enhance generalisability sensitivity and specificity should be stratified by setting outpatient versus in-patient severity of illness and the number of days elapsed since symptom onsetin summary we have found major weaknesses in the evidence base for serological tests for covid-19 the evidence does not support the continued use of existing point-of-care serological tests for covid-19 while the scientific community should be lauded for the pace at which novel serological tests have been developed this review underscores the need for high quality clinical studies to evaluate these tools with international collaboration such studies could be rapidly conducted and provide less biased more precise and more generalisable information on which to base clinical and public health policy to alleviate the unprecedented global health emergency that is covid-19to find cases we interviewed clinicians reviewed regional records and searched a national laboratory database we interviewed all persons who had received a mers-cov diagnosis in the region and reviewed hospitalized patients medical charts proxy interviews were conducted for patients who were in the intensive care unit or who had died we then conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess infection risk factors among household members we aimed to interview and test all members of the 4 households of the 5 known mers-covinfected patients as well as relatives who regularly visited these households and were present on the day of the on-site investigationon june 5 trained nurses collected 1 oropharyngeal and 1 nasopharyngeal swab for rrt-pcr and 1 blood sample for serologic testing from all available household members and visiting relatives hospitalized persons persons who previously had tested positive by rrt-pcr and children 14 years of age did not undergo serologic testing local public health officials had previously collected oropharyngeal swabs for rrt-pcr in the households during may 2029 we reviewed these records on june 5 trained physicians administered a standardized questionnaire to household members and visiting relatives to identify symptoms and healthcare exposures and infection risk factors including animal contact recent travel underlying medical conditions tobacco use and details of exposure to each households index patient an index patient was defined as the person with rrt-pcr confirmation of mers-cov who had the earliest date of symptom onset in the householdto understand whether this outbreak was affecting the broader community we collected data at the towns hospital at the outpatient clinic nearest the familys homes at 2 local slaughterhouse facilities and at the towns weekly livestock animal market all hospital staff members who had treated the first identified mers-cov patient from his admission on may 9 until his mers-cov diagnosis on may 20 underwent hospital-based rrt-pcr of oropharyngeal swabs may 2123 serologic testing was not performed at the outpatient clinic all staff and a convenience sample of patients who visited the clinic on june 4 with respiratory symptoms or fever were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire and tested for mers-cov by using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for rrt-pcr and blood for serologic testing all animal workers at 2 local slaughterhouse facilities and a convenience sample of persons with daily animal contact who were present at the towns weekly livestock animal market on june 4 were interviewed and tested by using the same methodsspecimens from hospitalized patients and hospital staff members underwent rrt-pcr at the ministry of healths jeddah regional laboratory according to ministry of health protocol 18 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal flocked swabs collected in the households at the community clinic and in animal workers were placed in viral transport media and transferred at 4c to king abdulaziz university where rrt-pcr amplification of consensus viral rna targets upstream of e and open reading frame 1a was undertaken 19 serum samples were sent to cdc and screened for mers-cov antibodies by the recombinant mers-cov nucleocapsid protein elisa and confirmatory testing was conducted with immunofluorescence assay and microneutralization 20we analyzed questionnaire data using epi info 70 cdc atlanta ga usa proportions were compared by using the 2 or fischer exact test and medians by using wilcoxon rank-sum risk ratios rrs were calculated we compared questionnaire data for all mers-covpositive by rrt-pcr or serology relatives 14 years of age with questionnaire data for all mers-covnegative relatives 14 years of age we excluded children from analysis because they had not had antibody testing of serum a household secondary transmission analysis comprised relatives 14 years of age residing only in the 4 affected households results for mers-covpositive household members who had illness onset or tested mers-covpositive at least 2 days after the households index patients illness onset were compared with results for mers-covnegative household membersbecause this investigation was part of a public health response it was not considered by cdc and the saudi arabia ministry of health to be research that was subject to review by an institutional review board participants gave verbal consentmers-cov was diagnosed in 11 58 of the 19 patients by rrt-pcr the standard method in saudi arabia table 1 for 7 of these including the 5 original patients illness was

rrt-pcr by regional health officers one of these contacts denied symptoms 2 reported mild symptoms ie cough subjective fever but had not sought medical care and 1 n the only child given a mers-cov diagnosis had visited an emergency department with fever in the 4 households all nonhospitalized family members were rrt-pcrnegative when tested on june 5 indicating little risk for ongoing household transmissionfor 8 42 of the 19 positive family members mers-cov infection was diagnosed only retrospectively by using serology all 8 previously had tested negative by rrt-pcr during april 21may 29

households 3 and 4 only the index patients both adult men tested positive no secondary patients were identified all family members in whom mers-cov symptoms developed or who had positive rrt-pcr results reported contact with at least 1 ill relative in the preceding 14 days figure 3 when we compared results for the 9 secondary adult patients adults who tested mers-covpositive with illness onset after the presumed index patient in these 4 households with the results for 21 adults in the households who tested negative we identified several major risk factors for mers-cov transmission in univariate analysis table 3 these risk factors included sleeping in the same room as an index patient rr 41 95 ci 15112 touching his respiratory secretions rr 40 95 ci 1698 and removing his biological waste rr 32 95 ci 1284 notable variables not associated with being a secondary patient included hugging or social kissing sharing plates cups meals sheesha or a toilet and cleaning or feeding the index patientexcept for members of this extended family the regional hospital admitted no other mers-cov patients of 131 hospital workers who cared for patient c 1 08 a nurse who remained asymptomatic tested positive by rrt-pcr on may 23 all 44 persons tested at the outpatient clinic 21 patients with respiratory complaints and 23 staff were mers-covnegative by both rrt-pcr and serology all 11 slaughterhouse workers and 10 livestock market participants tested negative by rrt-pcr one 5 asymptomatic slaughterhouse worker demonstrated antibodies to mers-cov by serology he had no known contact with any family members in the clusterthis investigation defined the epidemiology of a large family cluster of mers-cov infection in saudi arabia identified multiple possible household transmission risk factors and highlighted the useful role of serology in describing the extent of family clusters and spectrum of illness for approximately half 42 of the 19 mers-covinfected family members rrt-pcr results were negative while they were ill or after recognized exposure and infection was diagnosed only retrospectively by serology this included patients tested during extended hospitalizations and demonstrates real-world limitations in rrt-pcr or timing of specimen collection transport and testing this finding highlights the need for clinicians to consider mers-cov diagnoses in appropriate clinical settings even in patients with negative rrt-pcr results clinicians should consider obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens to improve the sensitivity of rrt-pcr particularly if nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal test results are negative and clinical suspicion is high and they should consider follow-up serologic testing most importantly clinicians should apply appropriate infection control practices for patients with clinically suspected illness regardless of initial rrt-pcr resultsonly 3 of the 19 mers-covinfected family members were women all wives of patients infection predominance in males has characterized mers-cov since its identification 64 of patients globally have been male 5 and might reflect biologic or behavior differences such as men and women socializing separately 2122 underlying illness has previously been linked to more severe mers-cov symptoms and signs 23 but whether underlying illness also makes persons more susceptible to initial mers-cov infection is less clear this study in which 96 of household members were tested found an increased infection risk among persons with underlying chronic illnessesour data indicate close contact eg sleeping in the same room as an index patient and direct patient care activities eg touching a patients respiratory secretions and removing his body waste rather than casual contact or simple proximity increases risk for transmission although smoking sheesha was a statistically significant risk factor for infection the 2 infected family members who smoked sheesha denied smoking together making it an unlikely mechanism of transmission guidance on preventing household transmission of mers-cov should emphasize minimizing close contact with patients outside of this extended family and 1 asymptomatic exposed nurse and 1 asymptomatic camel slaughterhouse worker we did not find evidence for wider community transmission of mers-covtwo 11 of the infected family members died as of may 1 2016 saudi arabia had reported 588 deaths among 1380 confirmed mers-cov patients for an overall 43 case-fatality rate 17 the substantially lower fatality rate in this family most likely reflects aggressive contact tracing and use of serology to identify mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients patients in this family also were younger median age 37 years than mers-cov patients globally median 48 years 5 the case-fatality rate in this cluster might reflect the broader population across the spectrum of illnesspreviously described mers-cov family clusters and household contact investigations have reported household attack rates ranging from 1 to 19 1114 household attack rates in this investigation were markedly higher 64 and 42 of the adults in 2 households were infected this difference could be due to methodologic differences in our investigation serology identified mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients which would increase the attack rate over investigations that relied only on rrt-pcr the attack rate however could have actually been higher in this cluster for several reasons first mers-cov diagnoses were missed or delayed among the first cases in the family the first 2 patients to become ill patients a and b were hospitalized but had negative rrt-pcr results during illness their subsequent positive serologic results confirmed that the earlier illness had in fact been undiagnosed mers-cov the third patient patient c was ill for 14 days before receiving a diagnosis a time during which many other family members reported contact with him because this community had not previously experienced mers-cov infections family members and local hospital staff might have had limited suspicion for mers-cov infection and not limited close contact in contrast when mers-cov infection was diagnosed in index patients in households 3 and 4 the family and local hospital staff was highly attuned to the possibility of mers-cov infection and took precautions to prevent its spreadsecond patient c might have been part of a super-spreading event because up to 8 other infected persons might have been infected through contact with him figure 3 the concept of a super-spreading event was described during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003 2425 and more recently was observed in the mers-cov outbreak in healthcare facilities in south korea where each of 3 patients was associated with infection in 20 other persons 2627 finally although all infected persons denied animal contact and the range of symptom onset dates indicated ongoing person-to-person spread an environmental point-source of infection might have been missedour study had several limitations first in household 1 two persons had in fact been ill with mers-cov before the presumed household index patient received a diagnosis these persons had negative rrt-pcr results while ill and infection was diagnosed retrospectively when later serologic test results were positive the study questionnaire focused primarily on household exposures to the presumed index patient but persons in this household might have had a range of exposures to all 3 persons making isolation of the specific exposure that resulted in secondary infection more difficult second the small sample size did not enable multivariable risk factor analysis and confounding and collinearity could not be evaluated third serologic testing was not conducted for children 14 years of age and they were excluded from risk factor analysis the observed lower incidence of infection among children could be investigated by including children in future serologic investigations fourth sequential serologic testing was not performed so it is possible that persons identified as mers-cov-negative might not yet have seroconverted although none had developed respiratory illnesses before or after testing finally specimens were not available for genome sequencing which might have helped to clarify transmission chains within the family more studies are needed to define the virologic and epidemiologic factors involved in household transmission of mers-cov to inform future public health response including serologic methods in these investigations will help better identify the spectrum of mers-cov clinical presentations as testing methods evolve maintaining strict infection control practices for ill patients with strong epidemiologic risk factors for mers-cov remains crucial to containing further spreadcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel beta-coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-21 has become a worldwide pandemic severely disrupting the economic social and psychological well-being of countless people clinical presentation of covid-19 widely varies ranging from asymptomatic profiles to mild symptoms like high fever or cough to acute respiratory disease syndrome and death given this heterogeneous symptom presentation as well as difficulties with serology testing and contact tracing worldwide public health efforts continue to focus on containment and especially isolating adults most at risk for covid-19 infection and severe diseaseby extension an expanding body of research has investigated potential factors that increase covid-19 infection and disease severity risk it is well known for example that adults aged 65 years are much more likely to be hospitalized or die due to covid-19 obesity itself and adverse health behaviors like smoking also increase infection risk and likelihood of hospitalization23 several age and obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease cardiometabolic diseases eg type 2 diabetes hypertension and other disease states and syndromes are also of concern4 non-white ethnicity particularly being black regardless of country of origin socioeconomic deprivation and low levels of education even after adjustment for health factors point to less privilege unfortunately conferring risk5 among biological markers covid-19 infection or severity has been related to higher c-reactive protein and more circulating white blood cells and lower counts of lymphocytes or granulocytes eg monocytes68 sars-cov-1 has a similar profile except for a relatively normal total white blood cell count9these studies are invaluable for establishing or validating risk factors to guide clinical decisions and policymaker choices however we ultimately need to develop risk profiles derived from these factors to accurately predict who will and will not develop covid-19 and if a covid-19 disease course will be mild or presumptively severe ie require hospitalization machine learning data-driven modelling can be used to create robust highly accurate prediction models based on routinely collected biomedical data like demographics a complete blood count and standard medical biochemistry data critically using non covid-19 serological data we may gain insight into the hosts ability to fight covid-19 by examining antibody titers that detail the host response to past infectious pathogens this virome may affect host innate and adaptive immunity910 for example human cytomegalovirus vastly changes the composition of t and b cells11 and may induce immune senescence that could account for worse sars-cov-2 infection outcomestherefore similar to previous work12 our objective was to use machine learning to determine what combinations of baseline measures collected 1014 years ago could best predict which older adults developed covid-19 and if disease presentation was mild or severe in summary we achieved a 935 accuracy for predicting covid-19 infection based on a combination of age biochemistry and leukocyte markers and antibody titers to common pathogens like human cytomegalovirus human herpesvirus 6 and chlamydia trachomatis for covid-19 severity due to small sample size only antibody titers loaded for finals models that more modestly predicted severe disease 744 nonetheless this is the first report to propose retrospective risk factor profiles to clarify and better characterize who is most at risk for covid-19 in addition our results suggest that past infection history and antibody response may be an invaluable novel predictor of host immunity to covid-19 that warrants further studythis retrospective study involved the uk biobank cohort13 uk biobank consists of approximately 500000 people now aged 50 to 84 years mean age694 years baseline data was collected in 20062010 at 22 centers across the united kingdom1415 summary data is listed in table 1our study used the may 26th 2020 tranche of covid-19 polymerase chain reaction pcr data from public health england the following categories of predictors were downloaded 1 demographics 2 health behaviors and long-term disability or illness status 3 anthropometric and bioimpedance measures of fat muscle and water content 4 pulse and blood pressure 5 a serum panel of thirty biochemistry markers commonly collected in a hospital setting and 6 a complete blood count with a manual differential for quantitation of total white blood cells and sub-types among a randomized subset of 9695 participants as part of a separate pilot project baseline serum was thawed and tested to determine levels of antibodies to several antigens of 20 infectious diseases study

haydock research ethics committee 16nw0274 the detailed protocol is outlined at httpswwwukbiobankacukthrough a may 26th 2020 data upload from uk biobank our study was based on covid pcr test data available from march 16th to may 19th 2020 there were 4510 unique participants that had 7539 individual tests administered hereafter called cases or test cases for modeling covid-19 infection data each test case was coded by uk biobank as 0 and 1 respectively representing a negative or positive pcr test for modeling covid-19 disease severity each test case was coded as 0 and 1 which represented out-patient testing ie mild case or hospital in-patient testing with clinical signs of infection ie presumptively severe caseto offer insight into this frequently updated resource roughly weekly updates by public health england since inception late aprilearly may have so far consisted of new participants tested for the first time 356 or who have follow-up testing 644 as of the may 26th 2020 upload see table 1 a given participant had anywhere between 1 and 20 tests for covid-19 mean25 tests with 18  41 days between each test based on initial modelling there are not yet enough test cases per participant to robustly model complex changes in disease status as of june 5th 2020 an in-vs outpatient identification issue had been raised for 6 out of 105 hospitals and clinics thankfully we found no evidence in our prediction models that laboratory of clinical origin influenced our resultsthese factors included participant age in years at baseline sex education qualifications ethnicity and townsend deprivation index sex was coded as 0 for female and 1 for male for education higher scores roughly correspond to progressively more skilled tradevocational or academic training and skill need to attain the qualification ethnicity was coded as uk citizens who identified as white blackblack british or asianasian british the townsend index16 is a standardized score based on postal code ie zip code data taken from the census indicating the relative degree of deprivation or poverty presumably experienced by the participant based on their permanent addressthis category consisted of self-reported alcohol status smoking status a subjective health rating on a 14 likert scale excellent to poor and whether the participant had a self-described long-term medical condition illness or disability as noted in table 1 484 of participants indicated having such an ailment we independently confirmed with icd-10 based nhs-confirmed diagnoses that this self-report data was accurate these conditions included all-cause dementia and other neurological disorders various cancers major depressive disorder cardiovascular eg myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular diseases and events eg stroke cardiometabolic diseases eg type 2 diabetes renal and pulmonary diseases eg copd and other so called pre-existing conditions we chose to use this single latent variable for simplicity and because there were widely varying numbers of cases that severely underpowered our multivariable classifier analysesthe first automated reading of pulse diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the baseline visit were usedanthropometric measures of adiposity body mass index waist circumference were derived as described17 data also included bioelectrical impedance metrics that estimate central body cavity ie trunk and whole body fat mass fat-free muscle mass andor water content18serum biomarkers were assayed from baseline samples as previously described19 see table 1 for data summaries of the full covid-19 sample and the sub-group with serology data briefly using immunoassay or clinical chemistry devices spectrophotometry was used to initially quantify values for 34 biochemistry analytes uk biobank deemed 30 of these markers to be suitably robust after rigorous quality control to minimize systematic bias and random error in sample thawing and processing we downloaded all fully quality-controlled data from the main showcase we rejected a further 4 markers due data missingness 70 estradiol rheumatoid factor or because there was strong overlap with other variables that had more stable distributions or trait-like qualities glucose rejected vs glycated hemoglobin or hba1c direct bilirubin rejected vs total bilirubinas described httpbiobankctsuoxacukcrystalcrystaldocsinfdiseasepdf among 9695 randomized uk biobank participants selected from the full cohort baseline serum was thawed and pathogen-specific assays run in parallel using flow cytometry on a luminex bead platform20here the goal of the multiplex serology panel was to measure multiple antibodies against several antigens for different pathogens reducing noise and estimating the prevalence of prior infection and seroconversion in at least uk biobank all measures were initially confirmed in serum samples using gold-standard assays with median sensitivity and specificity of 970 and 937 respectively antibody load for each pathogen-specific antigen was quantified using median fluorescence intensity mfi caga titer load to h pylori was excluded due to lab-based data loss because seropositivity is difficult to assess for several pathogens we did not use pathogen prevalence as a predictor in modelstable 2 shows the selected pathogens their respective antigens estimated prevalence of each pathogen based roughly on antibody titers and assay values this array ranges from delta-type retroviruses like human t-cell lymphotropic virus 1 that are rare 1 to human herpesviruses 6 and 7 that have an estimated prevalence of more than 90spss subscription build 1001327 was used for all analyses due to differences in sample size mann-whitney u and kruskal-wallis tests were used to compare quantitative values and categories eg sex for all 7539 test cases and the 124 test cases with serology data ie the serology sub-group linear discriminant analysis lda was then leveraged using individual predictors or weighted combinations of predictors to maximally distinguish between 1 negative or positive diagnosis for covid-19 and 2 mild or severe covid-19 disease status lda relies on a regression-like linear set of functions that can combine several data ie features and create predictive models that are straightforward to interpret it is recognized that having a small number of test cases such as in the serology sub-cohort with many data types and features can lead to overfitting21 to guard against non-robust estimations parametric violations and model overfitting 1-fold cross-validation with non-parametric bootstrapping 95 confidence interval 1000 iterations was used while logistic regression is more robust to outliers than lda uk biobank data is vigorously quality-controlled to remove extreme values due to the small sample size of the serology sub-group logistic regression also would be more likely to have model overfitting that inflates true accuracyfirst lda was used to examine how useful each baseline predictor was for correctly determining covid-19 infection classification negative positive and disease severity mild severe this was done separately for all 7539 test cases and the 124 test cases in the serology sub-group next a series of forced entry models were used to see how well a set of related variables or features eg demographics predicted covid-19 infection or disease severity we recognize that some of these forced entry models are likely overfitted particularly for modeling disease severity risk nonetheless these models may provide a best case scenario for how well or poorly a class of predictors can perform in classification finally a stepwise approach wilks lambda f value entry384 was used to combine predictors into a risk profile that best classified covid-19 infection or separately for severity riskfor each classification model the accuracy ie percentage of test cases that were correctly classified sensitivity ie true positives correctly identified and specificity ie true negatives correctly identified were calculated the area under the curve auc with a 95 confidence interval ci was also used receiver operating characteristic roc curves plotting sensitivity against 1-specificity were created to visualize differences in prediction accuracy among sets of similar predictors or stepwise models for stepwise models the wilks lambda statistic and standardized coefficients were used to interpret how well and in what direction a given variable discriminated between positive vs negative covid-19 infection and mild vs severe disease a lower wilks lambda corresponds to a stronger influence on the canonical classifier alpha was set at 05the funders of the study had no role in the study design data collection data analysis or interpretation or writing of this report the corresponding author aaw had full access to all of the data in this study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit the report for publicationas shown in table 1 7539 total test cases for covid-19 were conducted among 4510 uk biobank participants 696  88 years between march 16th to may 19rd 2020 either in outpatient or inpatient settings there were 5329 negative cases and 2210 positive cases of the positive cases there were 996 mild and 1214 presumptively severe disease outcomes defined as a test case occurring in a hospital setting baseline data from 1014 years ago mean  1122 years was available for demographic laboratory biochemistry and clinical indices a central theme of this report is the comparison of the 7539 total test cases to a sub-group of 124 test cases with serology data table 2 in order to show that better model fit incorporating serology markers was not merely due to sample size differences or model inflation using non-parametric tests then table 1 indicates that the full cohort and serology sub-groups largely did not differ on most measures a few significant differences were clinically unremarkable for the serology sub-cohort and well within the range of normal values including lower pulse rate several markers reflecting better kidney function and a mean 06 109l lower total white blood cell count due to fewer lymphocytesnext each baseline variable was used to predict covid-19 infection for a given test case for context 706 of the 7539 test cases were negative consequently any predictor achieving an accuracy of 706 would be performing at chance a better measure of accuracy in this case is the auc where 05 is at-chance prediction and 10 is perfect accuracy we also focused on how well true covid-19 positive cases were identified ie sensitivity among all participants supplementary table 1 any given significant predictor could not correctly distinguish any true positive test cases 0 sensitivity auc mean and range0525 05150548 for the serology sub-cohort supplementary table 2 several established risk factors that loaded had better overall fit mean auc0625 auc range05280712 due to better sensitivity of predicting infection examples included ethnicity 132 alcohol status 154 apolipoprotein b 103 and two unusually strong biochemistry analytes urate 256 and testosterone 564 in order to see if biomarkers of past host response to pathogens was useful for predicting a current host response to covid-19 we then tested each antibody titer for an antigen to a specific pathogen as shown in supplementary table 3 antibody titers to 14 antigens across 12 pathogens each performed as well on average as other types of predictors mean auc0627 auc range05050707 in particular sensitivity was notable for antibody to the pp150 nter antigen to human cytomegalovirus 333 and bk vp1 to human t lymphotropic virus 1 308lastly as listed in table 3 sets of similar predictors were forced into a classifier model to gauge how well they collectively predicted covid-19 infection a stepwise model was also used to create a classifier that only included predictors which each provided unique predictive utility among all 7539 test cases top row sets of predictors including the stepwise model were only able to correctly identify covid-19 positive test cases up to 10 of the time supplementary table 4 illustrates that predictors loading in the stepwise model included lipid and kidney health markers white cell counts as well as smoking status ethnicity and the townsend deprivation indexin the serology sub-group bottom row some relatively sparse predictor sets had better sensitivity eg 533 while the biochemistry and serology forced entry models were likely overfitted the analyses may nonetheless provide a best case scenario for their usefulness as a group notably the stepwise model achieved 935 accuracy by correctly identifying when a covid-19 test case was negative 941 specificity or positive 923 sensitivity due to potential concerns with model overfitting the stepwise model was re-run with only predictors that had individually loaded significantly supplementary tables 2
and
3 this model had 6 variables and still achieved 798 accuracy as shown in supplementary table 4 predictors that loaded in the stepwise model included antibody titers for antigens of several common pathogens eg human cytomegalovirus chlamydia trachomatis lipid markers age in years white and red cell counts and testosteroneanother set of analyses next determined how each baseline predictor could predict which of the 2210 positive covid-19 cases had a mild or severe disease course for context 45 and 55 of test cases were mild or severe respectively thus accuracy of 50 would be considered chance prediction curiously while sensitivity was the difficult metric to achieve for covid-19 infection risk accurately distinguishing true negatives ie specificity was problematic for disease severity among all 2210 covid-19 positive test cases supplementary table 5 significant predictors showed a trade-off between better sensitivity or specificity and in general were only modestly useful auc mean and range0536 05240572 similarly for the serology only sub-group among 39 covid-19 positive test cases supplementary table 6 shows that only alanine aminotransferase and neutrophil count significantly predicted disease severity beyond chance likewise for serology data supplementary table 7 indicates that the only significant antibodies to load were for the u14 antigen to human herpesvirus 7 accuracy641 auc0729 and jc vp1 antigen to human jc polyomavirus accuracy59 auc 0671table 4 shows the relative predictive value of groups of predictors for covid-19 severity first for the full sample of 2210 positive test cases accuracy remained low and the proportion of true negatives ie specificity identified did not exceed 37 this was regardless of predictor sets with a sparse or dense number of predictors supplementary table 8 illustrates that the stepwise model included only alanine aminotransferase age in years and monocyte count which may explain its modest predictive utility above chance for the serology sub-group of 39 test cases despite strong concerns about model overfitting the accuracy sensitivity and specificity were similarly modest compared to all 2210 positive test cases for the biochemistry immunology and serology panels the stepwise model was sparse and had better overall accuracy 744 due to improved detection of actual mild cases 615 indeed supplementary table 8 shows that the stepwise model loaded 2 predictors antibody titers for htlv-1 gag antigen to the rare human t lymphotropic virus and jc vp1 antigen for the human polyomavirus that has an estimated prevalence of 575 in at least uk biobankthe objective of this study was to determine if baseline data from 20062010 could predict which older adults would develop covid-19 in 2020 and if that infection was presumptively mild or severe due to being at hospital in summary using machine learning we developed separate risk profiles that accurately predicted future host immunity for covid-19 infection 935 and severity 744 such profiles only require retrospective routine self-report and blood tests typically collected in out- and in-patient clinics and hospitals as proof-of-principle that these profiles work for example we confirmed as others have noted with previous uk biobank covid-19 data that non-white ethnicity low socioeconomic status and smoking can increase infectious risk5our most novel finding was that antibody titers reflecting pathogen exposure history and past host immunity were strong predictors of covid-19 infection and severity both as a group and especially in concert with established risk factors like age neutropenia and dyslipidemia this virome may consist of beneficial and detrimental pathogens that change how the immune system responds to a novel persistent viral challenge like covid-1910 for example we found antigens to human cytomegalovirus were the strongest predictors of infection risk in our stepwise model older adults with prior human cytomegalovirus infection evince exhaustion of the nave t cell pool and fewer memory versus effector cells22 this may explain why monocyte count was one of the few variables to predict covid-19 severity among all test cases in this study as innate immunity must compensate for covid-19 severity prediction antibody titer to the jc polyomavirus was the only serology predictor that loaded significantly in our stepwise model and is expressed in a majority of the general population this virus can induce hemagglutination in type o blood cells23 which may in some way influence why this blood type may be protective for covid-19 infection this may also explain why higher red blood cell count appeared to be an important predictor for infection riskfor other immunologic factors mobilization of innate immunity was not surprisingly relevant to infection risk and severity in particular granulocytes eg neutrophils monocytes loaded significantly in covid-19 infection and severity prediction models for stepwise models but not cytokines such as c-reactive protein c-reactive protein has been cited as a strong risk factor for covid-1924 however this marker merely reflects signaling of the acute phase response due to systemic infection typically being initiated by macrophages in contact with the pathogen and monocytes in the blood although lymphopenia and suppression of humoral immunity has been noted in covid-19 lymphocyte cell count was in this study a modest predictor by itself and did not load in final stepwise modelswe also confirmed and extended the importance of age and biological factors related to lipids and kidney health but curiously not obesity or comorbid conditions among now elderly adults in uk biobank age was one of the few factors to impact both infection and severity risk perhaps in concert lipoprotein metabolism changes with aging along with sedentary lifestyle can induce hyperlipidemia which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and may increase covid-19 infection risk25 the lack of association with bioimpedance-derived fat muscle and water quantitation or long-standing illness was unexpected but may be due to complex interactions that are beyond the scope of this report finally levels of testosterone by itself and in concert with other factors in the serology sub-group could strongly identify adults who would later develop covid-19 sex differences favoring covid-19 infection in men have been noted and andropause-induced reductions in testosterone occur in aging men as testosterone normally downregulates inflammation this loss may increase disease susceptibility26some major limitations should be noted in our study at this time the number of uk biobank participants with covid-19 and serology data is low particularly for positive test cases to temper this issue we first used k-fold validation and rigorous bootstrapping to avoid model overfitting for the stepwise models we also rigorously tested each predictor or set of predictors in the main sample or serology sub-group where we found that model fit was not overly biased in general regardless we acknowledge that sets of predictors with many variables may be overly optimistic in their prediction value larger sample sizes and gold standard classification schemes such as training and testing using separate datasets will be needed to validate that antibody titers and past pathogen history in general are relevant markers for covid-19 infection and disease course another limitation was the modest predictive value of most variables across all test cases which stands in contrast to high odds ratios for some of these same factors in uk biobank and other cohorts studies with smaller sample sizes will often show inflated relative risk or prediction accuracy due simply to less heterogeneous error variance however our study only examined so called main effects of predictors instead of complex interactions such as darker skin vitamin d content and covid-19 infection risk such interactions were beyond the scope of this report which attempted to create relatively straightforward risk profiles that could be used in a clinic or by policymakersin summary this is the first study to systematically use retrospective data in a large community cohort to predict future risk for covid-19 infection and severity despite baseline data having been collected 1014 years ago we nonetheless achieved excellent to encouraging accuracy by combining several sets of emerging risk factors together it is especially interesting that serological data performed as well or better than any other data type future work should leverage past pathogen history and host immunity to inform what may happen when the host is challenged by covid-19the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in china in later december 2019 and has become pandemic after global spreading sars-cov-2 has infected 76819 people out of which 12077 were critical 2251 died 29 fatality rate and 18878 clinically recovered during the first 50 days of the outbreak in china 1 2 as of june 6 2020 it has been reported 6663304 confirmed cases and 392802 deaths by sars-cov-2 infection among over 200 countries and territories 3 to mitigate the risk of spread it is necessary to investigate and develop effective treatment and diagnostic options the signs and symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection are not specific most are associated with respiratory complications after onsets such as cough dyspnea and viral pneumonia but the mortality of critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia is also considerable 4 5 therefore specific covid-19 diagnostic tests are required to confirm suspected cases accurately and shortly besides specific diagnostic techniques appropriate samples or specimens for the detection of the viral genome are also of high importance 6 7previous studies on covid-19 pneumonia have largely focused on clinical characteristics and epidemiology 8 9 however very limited details are available related to effective diagnostic strategies in the current situation the specificity and sensitivity of the tests are not widely known therefore testing of multiple specimen types is recommended 10 11 the most widely used tests in the current situation are based on nucleic acid detection and antibody detection although the viral nucleic acid rt-pcr test has become the standard method for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis high false-negative rates were reported 12 thus an accurate and infallible detection for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis is urgently neededupon coronavirus infection igm antibodies are produced as an early immune response after infection in the body which may indicate current infection or new infection during the early stage of the infection days 410 the igm component of the test provides a sensitivity of just 70 this rises rapidly to 923 between days 11 and 24 and the igg component of the test offers a sensitivity of 986 during this phase of the infection or even longer 13 igg antibodies are the main antibodies produced as an immune response indicating that the disease has entered a recovery period or that there is a prior infection 14 15 therefore combined tests of immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg antibodies can not only provide the diagnosis of infectious diseases but also help to evaluate the stages of infection in the body 12 13to explore the accurate and reliable detection for covid-19 diagnosis the present work was conducted to evaluate the nucleic acid-based and antibodies-based tests for sars-cov-2-infected patients a total of 133 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples from confirmed covid-19 patients were divided into three subgroups by the severity of illness and surveyed with nucleic acid test and igm-igg antibody test respectively moreover the igm and igg antibodies concentrations were also investigated with no differences among three subgroups based on the severity of covid-19 our findings revealed that the adjunct of the serological test to nucleic acid test improves the accuracy in covid-19 diagnosis after onsetsa total number of 133 patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection in renmin hospital wuhan university china from january 23 to march

including clinical examination computed tomography ct and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 group was divided into three subgroups according to new pneumonia diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 trial version 5 including 44 moderate cases 52 severe cases and 37 critical cases table 2the moderate severe and critical cases were defined based on symptoms severity and condition of the patients according to who interim guidance 16 briefly moderate cases were defined as mild symptoms including fever cough headache or soreness from cough but no pain while severe cases as severe signs including inflammation of lungs extreme breathlessness pain in the chest fast heartbeat or unwell appearance and low blood pressure the critical patients were defined as those admitted to the intensive care unit icu who required mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 of at least 60 or more as previously described 4data on biochemical parameters were obtained from all 133 confirmed sars-cov-2 infected patients which was confirmed by a broad series of investigations including clinical examination

 however we didnt observe significant differences in positive rate among three subgroups of covid-19 patients p  005furthermore the antibodies-based tests were performed in three subgroups of covid-19 patients in igm antibody detection in patients infected with sars-cov-2 the positive rate was 795 in moderate cases 827 in severe cases and 730 in critical cases respectively similarly the positive rate from igg antibody test was 932 in moderate cases 100 in severe cases and 973 in critical cases respectively table 3 there was no statistically significant difference in the positive rate of igm-igg antibody detection for covid-19 patients among the three subgroups p  005 in total it appeared an increased positive rate in antibodies-based tests to that in the nucleic acid test indicating that the adjunct of serological test improved the accuracy in the covid-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illnessfinally the concentrations of igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 in the serological tests for covid-19 patients in different subgroups were examined the concentration of igm in patients was 2919 auml 17046102 in moderate cases 4076 auml 13569013 in severe cases and 2325 auml 8671045 in critical cases respectively meanwhile the concentration of igg in patients was 14773 auml 89531716 in moderate cases 14863 auml 130951677 in severe cases and 1404 auml 93791628 in critical cases respectively table 4
 collectively there were no significant differences in the concentrations of igm and igg antibodies among three subgroups of covid-19 patients suggesting the serological test behaved as a considerable diagnosis for covid-19 patients regardless of the severity of illnessthe outbreak of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 spreads rapidly posing a serious threat to the lives and health of the people which has become a serious global issue sars-cov-2 belongs to the coronavirus beta genus with a linear single-stranded positive rna the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans after sars 2002 and mers middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2012 18 there are various assays developed to detect different regions of sars-cov-2 genome using rt-pcr 10 19 in the present study we evaluated both antibody and nucleic acid -based diagnostic strategies on suspected patients with moderate to critical symptoms for covid-19 of the total 133 patients were tested 684 91133 were positive in the case of rt-pcr and 789 105133 in the case of the antibody test it was also observed an increased positive rate in antibodies-based tests to that in nucleic acid test in the diagnosis for covid-19 patients in different subgroups moderate cases severe cases and critical cases our findings suggested that the igm-igg antibody test provides an effective complement to the false-negative results from nucleic acid test for covid-19 diagnosisrecently chest ct scans were applied for the rapid detection of sars-cov-2 induced covid-19 11 20 the chest x-ray or chest ct provides more information but these are not conclusive as not all the patients with covid-19 developed pneumonia and might produce false results as many other things can also cause pneumonia 21 22 therefore a more effective strategy such that testing antibodies or rna is important the conventional serologic assays droplet digital ddpcr crispr-based and metagenomic next-generation sequencing mngs techniques are also novel approaches for the detection of sars-cov-2 in fact the optimal diagnosis ways for sars-cov-2 are usually selected based on the periods of illness onsets eg rt-pcr or serologic assays the viral load of specimens eg rt-pcr or ddpcr assays and the aim of pathogen identification of unexplained pneumonia eg crispr-based or mngs techniques 12 23 24 25 hence it is highlighted that the combined tests on sars-cov-2 antibodies and rna for the high accuracy of covid-19 diagnosis according to the desired requirements sars-cov-2 is an emerging kind of infectious pathogen and the immunological testing reagents have recently been developing 12 it has been established a high sensitivity and specificity of sars-cov-2 igm and igg antibodies detection in serum or plasma from covid-19 patients without cross-reactivity within samples from non-infected individuals 12 26 although the antibodies generated after a period of the onset of infection their detections side by side with rt-pcr detection were found more promising as an accurate detection strategy in the current situationit is suggested that serum antibodies-based tests could be effectively adjunctive to rt-pcr test particularly for patients who had the substantial duration of illness in whom rt-pcr may be negative the combining rt-pcr and igm-igg antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 even in the early phase of one week 27 moreover there is an increase in the positive rate for sars-cov-2 igm and igg with an increasing number of days post-disease onset dpo as a result after 10 to 24 dpo or even longer to 35 dpo igm-igg antibody detection can be an important supplementary method for covid-19 diagnosis 26 27 serological based testing will become a very valuable tool to access previous exposures and prevalence in the population 13 in our study we examined the interval of igm-igg antibody test after covid-19 patients onset 827 of patients were tested for igm-igg antibody during 1435 dpo while 136 of patients were tested more than 35 dpo and only 38 of patients were tested within 14 dpo we also retrospectively observed that some patients were tested after onsets in a prolonged period which is explained that the lack of timely rt-pcr and igm-igg antibody tests in early covid-19 epidemic in wuhan in january 2020 fortunately the status had been improved that portions of patients were timely tested with a reasonable interval after onsets since late january 2020 due to the effective interventions and efforts made by the chinese government nevertheless the serological test still behaved as a considerable diagnosis for covid-19 patients after onsetscertainly it was confirmed that the detection sensibility was higher in the igg-igm combined antibody test than in individual igg or igm antibody test 12 28 however a low viral load in patients throat and the limitation of rt-pcr result in a significant number of false-negative reports which should not be ignored 25 in general the coronavirus stimulates the immune response and igm antibodies are produced after 424 days upon infection and then quickly decline until disappear while on the other hand igg antibodies are usually produced after igm and continue to rise and remain high in the body for long periods 14 15 for treatment monitoring and status of the disease the decrease or even disappearance of the concentration of igm and the increase in the concentration of igg indicates the severity of the patient and the immunity to the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 actually we found there were no significant differences in the concentrations of igm and igg antibodies of covid-19 patients among three subgroups based on the severity of illness therefore further investigations should be made on a broad range and mainly focus on the antibodys response pattern and severity status of a larger scale of covid-19 patients on the bases of antibodies productionin conclusion our study revealed that the igm-igg antibody test exhibited a useful adjunct to rt-pcr detection which improved the accuracy in the covid-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illness considering the significance of this ongoing covid-19 pandemics we believe that our findings are important in terms of providing promising diagnostic options based on age or gender groups as well as the severity of symptoms we further recommend the igm-igg antibody test provides an effective complement to nucleic acid test for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis

conceptualization funding acquisition supervision writing - review  editingthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papersars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family which consists of enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses seven viruses in this family infect humans and these fall into two genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus 1 sars-cov-2 belongs to the sarbecovirus subgenus of the betacoronavirus genus that also includes a number of bat-specific sars-related sarsr coronaviruses that share 96-78 of its genetic identity as well as sars-cov responsible for the 20022003 china outbreak which shares 80 identity 1 2 in contrast mers-cov responsible for the 2012 middle-east outbreak and 2015 korean outbreak and human coronaviruses hku1 and oc43 which commonly cause milder upper respiratory illness belong to other betacoronavirus subgenera merbecovirus and embecovirus respectively and are less related to sars-cov-2 the remaining two human coronaviruses nl63 and 229e are alphacoronaviruses that are more distantly related to sars-cov-2 though like hku1 and oc43 they are widely present in the community and cause cold-like illnesses 13sars-cov-2 like sars-cov primarily infects pneumocytes within the hosts lungs this tropism is due to the virus ability to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors using the transmembrane spike s protein fig 1a the s protein found on the surface of the virus particle virion is one of four structural proteins spike nucleocapsid membrane and envelope found in all coronaviruses and is responsible for both the binding of the host receptor and the fusion of the virion with the host membrane structurally the s protein exists on the virion surface as a homotrimer comprised of three identical polypeptide chains each chain contains two subunits s1 and s2 subunit s1 makes up the majority of the s protein surface area and also includes the receptor binding domain rbd a small stretch of amino acids that allow sars-cov-2 to bind to the ace2 receptor 2 the rbd is the least genetically conserved portion of the s1 subunit sharing only 73 similarity with sars-cov and 2125 similarity to other human coronavirus s1 subunits 2 4 5 these genetic differences at the rbd dictate the viruss receptor specificity nearly all human coronaviruses other than sars-cov-2 and sars-cov bind glycoproteins or proteases other than ace2 although the distant relative nl63 appears to have independently evolved ace2 specificity 3 6the s2 subunit tethers the s protein to the virion membrane and includes the machinery required for virus cell fusion 5 as these features are located deep within the s protein core s2 is more conserved than s1 90 similarity with sars-cov s2 and 3543 similarity with the other coronavirus s2sdue to its location on the surface of the virus and its physiologic importance the coronavirus s protein is predictably immunogenic previous studies of sars-cov serum responses demonstrate that convalescent sera contain high titers of antibodies that bind to the s protein 7 some of these antibodies were also shown to protect cells from infection by live sars-cov in neutralization assays explained below 8 new studies focused on the current pandemic have also demonstrated that sera of previously infected sars-cov-2 patients react to sars-cov-2 s protein with some sera also cross-reacting with the sars-cov s protein 5 9serum from patients infected with coronaviruses also exhibit high reactivity against another structural protein the nucleocapsid n protein or np 5 7 8 n protein which exhibits high homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 90 binds and stabilizes the viral genome 5 while abundant it is found exclusively within the virion nevertheless anti-n antibodies are highly prevalent postinfection possibly generated by the presentation of digested virus protein by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells to b cells 10 these antibodies may not provide direct protection from infection but n protein is historically easier to produce than s-protein for use in assays anti-n antibodies can be used to detect prior infection as their titers correlate with antibody titers to s-protein much like antibodies against hepatitis-b virus hbv core antigen correlate with those against hbv surface antigen 5 furthermore test vaccines against sars-cov have shown n antigens to be potent inducers of cd8 cytotoxic t cells that can recognize and kill infected cells that present np complexed to mhci and antibodies to n may correlate with the development of such a response 11despite also being present on the surface the remaining structural proteins e and m are small and poorly exposed natural serum responses show few antibodies to these antigens 7the sars-cov-2 virus was first characterized by the sequencing of its viral genome providing the requisite information to develop quantitative or real-time polymerase chain reaction qpcr tests for the virus 1 2 12 using cdna reverse-transcribed from viral rna extracted from the virus qpcr like pcr replicates a specific region or amplicon of the viral genome fig 1b through the use of fluorescent probes and detection steps between replication cycles qpcr allows quantitation of the amount of viral rna viral load in a sample as dna is synthesized exponentially during pcr the fluorescence also increases exponentially the thermocycler instrument reports a ct cycle threshold which is the number of replication cycles that are required to produce a fluorescent signal that exceeds a baseline samples that contain a large starting amount of viral rna require fewer cycles to produce a detectable fluorescent signal and therefore have a lower ct the ct has a simple negative linear correlation with the logarithm of the number of viral copies in the original sample this relationship can be used to quantify the amount of viral rna in a specimen however the assays must then include additional standards containing known concentrations of viral rna another type of diagnostic test that uses primer-directed replication loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp provides point-of-care qualitative results but the lack of discrete replication cycles does not allow accurate quantitation and these assays typically have a higher limit of detection than qpcr 13 14currently as of may 16 2020 the fda has granted emergency use authorization eua for sars-cov-2 molecular tests to 61 test kit manufacturers and commercial laboratories and 28 laboratory-developed tests authorized for use by the singular developing laboratory while the initial eua molecular assays such as the one from centers for disease control and prevention  used manual protocols many of the subsequent commercial assays tend to use individual cartridges that contain all of the reaction components eg cepheid xpert or are performed on large robotic platforms that can process more than a 1000 specimens per day eg roche 68008800 cartridge-based assays offer rapid turnaround time within 60 min require less space and are simpler to deploy with the trade-off of greater cost per test and lower throughput instruments that use cartridge-type molecular tests such as the cepheid xpert biofire film array and genmark eplex are available in many smaller hospitals and can also be used for syndromic panels to detect a range of respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens larger health systems may use multiple types of analyzers to meet their particular needs they may use rapid low-throughput assays for the testing of urgent or emergent admissions as well as high-throughput instruments for less time-critical and more cost-efficient testing for inpatient units and outpatient settings where 6-24-hour turnaround times are more acceptablefalse-positive results for molecular tests are uncommon because of intrinsic designs and rigorous quality control guidelines the fidelity of base pairing makes qpcr and other amplification techniques highly specific distinguishing sar-cov-2 from other coronaviruses additionally the eua application process requires that a sars-cov-2 molecular test not cross-react with 20 commonly encountered respiratory pathogens and additionally have greater than 95 negative percent agreement analogous to specificity when there is no established reference method with at least 30 specimens that tested negative using another eua test in a recent study comparing four sars-cov-2 pcr assays with a range of sensitivities the negative percent agreement ranged from 96 to 100 15 nevertheless improper sample handling and contamination of reagents have the ability to create such false positivesthe clinical sensitivity of sars-cov-2 pcr tests the ability to detect infection using nasopharyngeal or other upper respiratory specimens is not well-defined since a positive pcr test is the gold standard for diagnosis in most published studies while the analytical sensitivity or limit of detection lod for a eua molecular test under ideal conditions can vary between 50 and 1000 viral copiesml 15 the clinical sensitivity depends also on factors related to collection of sample such as specimen type sars-cov-2 presence in the upper airways is less than that of the lower airways and nasopharyngeal swabs nasal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs differ greatly in their ability to detect virus 1619 one report found that 73 of 353 of patients who tested positive by nasopharyngeal swab tested negative by simultaneous oropharyngeal swab 16 and until recently nasopharyngeal swab has been the preferred specimen to collect sputum samples and pulmonary lavage have been shown to have higher sensitivity than both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs though the number of such samples tested has been small 1921 these lower respiratory specimens may be useful for detecting sars-cov-2 in severely ill patients however this type of testing is generally limited at present to large academic institutions and reference laboratories that have carried out the necessary validation experiments that must be performed before routinely testing these specimen types furthermore collection of these specimens can introduce additional risk to clinicians there is increasing evidence that molecular tests run on saliva may be also be a suitable and more easily obtained specimen 22timing of specimen collection is also crucial to clinical sensitivity early in the course of infection viral loads are high typically in the range of 10000 to several million copiesml in upper respiratory specimens resulting in low ct readouts this is the case of both clinical disease and asymptomatic infection as symptoms of covid-19 tend to result from the immune response to the infection over a few days these high viral loads can decrease by a 1000-fold or more 23 drops in viral load during late acute illness may be inconsequential for more sensitive assays under ideal collection conditions but may be missed if the collection method recovers too little rna or the test cannot detect enough this is especially true for tests using nasal or oropharyngeal swabs which can see significant drops in sensitivity after a week of symptoms 24 25 large studies comparing clinical sensitivity of diagnostic tests to well-defined clinical and laboratory criteria defining covid-19 disease are neededanother diagnostic challenge is the interpretation of persistently positive pcr tests in convalescent patients it is not uncommon to have a positive pcr test often with a low viral load 46 weeks after the resolution of symptoms 24 26 pcr and related tests only detect genetic material including remnants of dead virus and do not necessarily indicate active infection by replicating virus indeed a small study using viral culture suggests that patients with protracted qpcr positivity may not be infectious 27while qpcr of nasopharyngeal swabs remains the gold standard of testing acute cases laboratory tests that detect antiviral antibodies often referred to as serological tests can be an important adjunct to molecular assays amidst the current pandemic serological assays may detect the later stages of infection when they may be less detectable by some pcr tests 24 25 two studies showed that antibody testing can augment qpcr in improving overall sensitivity after day 7 of symptoms 24 25 although maximal sensitivity is not achieved until 14 days after symptom onset 28 immunoglobulin ig m titers against sars-cov-2 may be present in as short as a few days from symptom onset and igg titers may exist for weeks or longer 24 some serological assays can also be performed with a minimum amount of blood derived from a simple finger prick finally serological assays can identify patients who have already recovered from disease if current reports hold true that cases of re-infection are few such tests could potentially allow preferential deployment of previously exposed healthcare workers to operate in high risk settings though the correlation between antibodies and protection remains controversial see below convalescent patients also hold the potential to be donors for passive immunization or serum-transfer therapies and such assays can be valuable screening tools for this purpose 29 however care should be taken when using serological assays in immunocompromised patients as some may not mount a humoral immune response capable of generating antibodiesthe standard type of assay for detecting antiviral antibodies in serum is an indirect elisa fig 2a 7 30 which involves initially adding sera or dilutions of sera to wells of a plastic plate containing prebound viral antigens these antigens bind only the antigen-specific antibodies found within the serum and retain them when the plate is washed the antigen-bound antibody is later detected with an enzyme-linked secondary antibody which binds to general host antibody or to host antibody of a specific isotype eg igg igm the plate is then developed with a colorimetric substrate which the enzyme on the secondary antibody cleaves to cause a color accumulation proportional to the amount of antibody bound during early elisa development many dilutions of the same serum are used to examine the gradient of color intensity optical density od and arbitrary od cutoffs are used to determine the titer or minimum dilution factor needed for the od to exceed background signal however as these assays become perfected for diagnostic use they must be calibrated to provide accurate positive and negative results elisa-type assays can also be adapted to run on the surface of paramagnetic beads rather than plastic plates such technologies are suitable for processing in automated high throughput commercial instruments that also use sensitive chemiluminescent detection systems additionally as monoclonal antibodies specific to sars-cov-2 are developed the format of the elisa can be flipped to allow direct detection of antigens from nasopharyngeal specimens this has recently been accomplished by quidel which has received eua of its antigen sandwich elisa test httpswwwfdagovmedia137885download with a clinical sensitivity of 80 relative to qpcr the specifics of antigen tests are not covered in this reviewmany commercial tests have adapted the principles of the elisa into rapid and simple immunochromatographic assays such as lateral-flow assays lfa 31 these assays can be single or multistep but all involve added serum and reactants traveling across a linear membrane by capillary action traveling through different detection regions this eliminates the need for separate washing steps and permits multiplexing to allow detection of more than one antibody isotype in a single test in one type of single-step lfa fig 2b 32 serum antibodies first flow through an area where those specific to the virus pickup free viral antigen that are conjugated to a detection molecule such as colloidal gold these coupled antibodies as well as the nonreactive ones then pass over an area with discrete bands of immobilized secondary antibodies that capture sera antibodies of specific isotypes presence of the detection molecule at a particular band which causes a color change indicates that sera antibodies of that particular isotype also successfully bind antigen fig 3 alternatively lfas with multiple channels may contain viral antigen immobilized on a surface which then captures antiviral antibodies complexed to a labeled conjugate antibody while most immunochromatographic assays provide only qualitative results some of them incorporate additional components to allow for increased sensitivity specificity or semiquantitative estimates of antibody levels immunochromatographic assays are ideal for point of care assays because they are easy to use and commonly do not require additional large equipment though they may suffer from decreased performance compared to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa discussed belowwhen designing any binding assay selection of which antigen to test is crucial this selection should consider a variety of factors including antigen availability specificity and concentration as mentioned above antigens such as m and e proteins that are small or less-exposed may prove poor antigens to test immunity for sars-cov-2 next testing with an antigen with conserved epitopes may cause cross-reactivity where antibodies specific to a previous infection such as sars-cov test positive on a test for sars-cov-2 5 24 such cross-reactivity may not matter in the case of the current pandemic as sars-cov is not prevalent amongst most patients nevertheless if the protein or subunit used as the antigen is so conserved that it shares similarity with distant but more endemic viruses such as hku or oc43 antibodies against these viruses could theoretically cause false positive results and limit the specificity of the assay 31 33 such concerns have led some assays to use specific subunits such as s1 or the rbd itself as the antigen as these are most specific and might limit cross-reactivity regardless of the antigen used extensive validation with proper controls is always required to ensure the functional use of any assayonce an assay is developed it must then be tested and calibrated in the clinical setting determining a diagnostic cutoff can be challenging because over time humans are exposed to numerous infectious agents that may exhibit varying degrees of antigenic similarity many commercial infectious disease serological assays use a reactive control that is validated by comparing individuals known to have infection with an uninfected control group this requires use of a reference method to distinguish the two populations in a quantitative assay the od or signal of the patients serum is compared with the signal of the reactive control to generate an index index values greater than 1 are then interpreted as reactive or positive because of the novelty of sars-cov-2 and the lack of an official gold standard to reference these tests diagnostic cutoffs for these assays are likely to evolve however over time as these assays are used and compared with clinical progression more accurate cutoffs will eventually be calibratedas of may 16 2020 the fda has granted emergency use authorization for 12 tests that detect antibodies igmigg or igg only against sars-cov-2 this group includes 10 kit manufacturers or reference laboratories one academic laboratory and a state health department in addition nearly 200 manufacturers had notified the fda that they have validated and are offering serology tests as set forth in section ivd of the fdas emergency policy for diagnostic tests for covid-2019 httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesfaqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2 only 6 of these assays have been listed as fda authorized the others many of which are rapid-type assays have been listed as not fda authorized pending submission of validation data to the fda for an eua application there is little published data describing the performance characteristics of most of these assays however the fda has begun publishing reported measures of sensitivity specificity positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv for serology tests that have an eua httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-deviceseua-authorized-serology-test-performance one recent study evaluated 10 lfas and two elisas that had not yet been given eua by the fda 33 among specimens from sars-cov-2 rt-pcr-positive individuals the percentage of seropositive specimens increased with time interval peaking at 82100 in samples taken 20 days after symptom onset test specificity ranged from 84 to 100 in pre-covid-19 specimens the majority demonstrated a specificity greater than 95 but only three had a specificity 99 33it should be noted that despite high apparent sensitivities and specificities the current low prevalence of sars-cov-2 has significant effects on the ppv of these tests for example if a test has 95 sensitivity and 99 specificity and 5 of the population has had a covid-19 infection the ppv would be 83 if the specificity is instead 95 the ppv drops to 50while antibody tests can accurately detect viral exposure they may be less helpful in identifying or detecting the presence of neutralizing antibodies that can prevent the virus from infecting host cells and therefore confer immunity for example while anti-np antibodies may correlate with protection against infection as well as with the presence of anti-s antibodies assays that detect sars-cov-2 anti-np antibodies cannot directly detect neutralizing antibodies which most likely bind s protein 34 in addition the s protein of sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses can flip between open and closed conformations and their rbds can be masked by the presence of glycan sugars surrounding them 6 35 such features can cause the infected host to synthesize decoy antibodies that bind the s protein but do not affect infectivity as a result the presence of binding antibody and protection against infection is not always correlated indeed one study found a negative correlation where high antibodies against sars-cov-2 were found in the sickest patients 25 therefore testing of antibody correlates of protection against sars-cov-2 and other viruses requires more informative tests namely the use of viral inhibition assaysin a basic viral inhibition assay also known as a plaque reduction neutralization test prnt monolayers of cultured cells are exposed to live virus mixed with sera fig 4a 30 after an incubation period the cells are checked for signs on infection such as the presence of multinucleated syncytia on microscopy 8 or the expression of viral proteins on the infected host surface which can be identified with fluorescent detection antibodies 30 the numbers of infected cells in plates exposed to virus and sera are then compared with that of plates exposed to virus alone with the hope that plates exposed to virus with sera have fewer infections such assays can also use dilutions of sera to quantify the minimum titer that can inhibit the number of infected cells by a certain percentage such as 50 fig 4b these minimum titers are then reported as the inhibitory dose or id eg id50while traditional viral inhibition assays are prohibitively difficult for natural sars-cov-2 which must be handled in biohazard safety level 3 conditions these assays can be easily modified with current technologies to provide safer and easier study settings 30 the virus itself can be attenuated by genetic modification or alternatively its proteins expressed in a less-virulent nonhuman pseudotyped viral vector 8 these pseudotyped virions can be used to infect nonhuman cell lines that express the correct receptor additionally the packaging of genes encoding fluorophores or enzymes into these virions and cell lines can also allow the identification of infection by fluorescence or bioluminescence which can be automated this automation can be used through the use of plate readers that optically measure bulk signal in each cell culture well or alternatively through flow cytometry where individual cells in a culture mix are passed sequentially through a detector that counts the exact percentage of cells that either carry an infection marker or remain uninfected thanks to protection by serum antibodies 30 35it is important to note that host factors and population heterogeneity can contribute significantly to variability in cross-reactivity and neutralization efficacy of convalescent sera studies in animal models using genetically-attenuated virus 35 can create antibodies that neutralize both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 while human sera samples may only neutralize one species 4 some antibodies may also promote antibody-mediated enhancement of infection at insufficient concentrations 36 these differences stem from the fact that host responses differ based on genetics and other factors patient serum responses are also polyclonal containing antibodies that recognize several different antigens all at different relative concentrations as a result randomized clinical trials to test the efficacy of convalescent plasma will be required and testing of convalescent plasma should be done to quantify in-vitro neutralizing efficacy future prospective monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov-2 could provide a more consistent therapeutic response 37 however such antibodies require rigorous testing and may require combination with additional monoclonal antibodies to be efficacious such endeavors cannot be scaled quickly in time to meet current demandnucleic acid amplification technology pcr assays and serological assays are both important components in current efforts to diagnose treat and limit the spread of sars-cov-2 as outlined in this review providers should be aware of the strengths and limitations of individual assays qpcr will remain the gold standard for diagnosing acute infection and will assist diagnoses of immunocompromised patients serological tests can aid in diagnosing late acute infections and will be important for diagnosing previously undiagnosed resolved infections high-capacity elisa-type serological assays will be essential in the coming months to assess the extent of infection in the community information that is needed to help guide options for relaxing isolation restrictions lastly neutralization assays will be vital in testing potential plasma donors and monoclonal antibodies as viable treatment options ultimately all of these different assays need optimization to provide accurate results and need to be scaled up to meet global demandsince september 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome mers has spread from the middle east to 27 countries causing more than 2374 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with an average mortality of 354 as of february 2019 1  the who recommendation for laboratory detection of the causal agent mers coronavirus mers-cov includes real-time rtpcr targeting upstream of the e protein gene or nucleocapsid protein np gene complemented with orf1a and orf1b 2 serological tests are also recommended when a viral nucleic acid test was not applicable or for population-based serosurveys and investigations of past exposures viral spike s protein-based indirect elisa followed by a confirmatory virus neutralization test vnt is the mostly widely used serological test for mers-cov in contrast np based serological assays are seldom used because of their greater cross-reactivity 27tracing the source of human mers infection is pivotal to prevent transmission of this disease dromedary camels have been identified as an important source for zoonotic transmission of mers-cov after detection of neutralizing antibodies 76100 seropositive and almost identical viruses were identified in middle east camels 38 it is widely believed that mers-cov could have originated from africa as most of these animals were originally bred and exported from africa 9 although mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and viral rna have been found in camels from west and east african countries zoonotic human infections have not been reported in africa 491011 the majority of these studies used an s-based serosurvey and showed high positivity for mers-cov infection in camels 348911there are two studies which have previously tested both s and np igg antibodies in middle east camels of the two studies one reported a strong correlation between np positives by western blot 97 and s-based vnt positives 98 using camel samples from the united arab emirates 12 the second study tested camel sera from saudi arabia and found more samples seropositive for s than np by elisa western blot or the luciferase immunoprecipitation system lips 13 the latter study did not proceed with further analysisin this study we conducted a nationwide serosurvey for coronavirus infection from samples first screened for mers-cov by elisa and vnt 14 our aim was to investigate the possible new genotype of mers-cov in kenyan camels using a serology-predicted pathogen discovery strategythe director of veterinary service at the ministry of agriculture livestock and fisheries in kenya granted permission to conduct this study the camel sampling was performed in 2016 and 2018 across 13 counties where camels are reared taking into account breed types 14 four distinct breeds of camel are recognized in kenya somali turkana gabbrarendille and imported pakistani which were imported from pakistan in the 1980s the sampling locations were recorded and confirmed by gps other information such as age sex pregnancy and migration was collected a total of 894 camel serum samples were used in this study in addition 1136 camel nasal swabs collected in januaryfebruary 2016 and 286 camel nasal swabs collected in februarymarch 2018 were used for molecular tests all camel samples were collected in compliance with local regulations and then transported to wuhan institute of virology wiv according to iata international regulations for transporting biological samples 14an in-house anti-mers-cov igg elisa kit was developed based on the purified receptor-binding domain rbd of spike protein and validated for kenya and pakistan camels 1415 purified np of mers-cov sars-like cov rp3 human coronaviruses oc43 hku1 229e and nl63 and bat covs hku2 and hku9 were produced and applied to elisa or western blot in this and previous studies 1618 a bat hku8r-cov id 4050 from china np gene that shares a 93 amino acid sequence identity to the miniopterus bat coronavirus hku8-cov np genbank accession number yp001718616 was inserted into pet-28a novagen for prokaryotic expression kenyan hku8r-cov strain btky33 np and s1 synthesized from genbank accession nohq7284851 were inserted into pcaggs or phcmv vector with n-terminal s-tag btky33 np and s1 plasmids transiently transfected hek293t-17 cell supernatant was used in western blot camel serum samples were tested in the elisa 120 dilution or western blot 1100 dilution and goat anti-camel igg-hrp conjugate alpha diagnostic international was used as the secondary antibody at 13000 dilution a cut-off value for each antigen was determined in elisa after validationlysates of mers-cov infected vero cells were generated in the biosafety level 3 laboratory at wiv loaded onto 12 sds-page gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes membranes were incubated with selected mers-cov rbd positive and np positive or negative camel sera for 1 h at 37c 1100 dilution after blocking membranes were then washed and then incubated with anti-camel igg-hrp secondary antibody as above for another 1 h at 37c followed by three more washesmers-cov np china hku8r-cov np above and s1 amino acid 1150 of s protein synthesized from genbank accession no yp0017186121 were codon-optimized and inserted in the pren2 vector 1519 plasmids were transfected into hek293t-17 cells using lipofectamine 3000 thermo fisher scientific cells were then collected lysed and incubated with camel serum samples serum 1 l was incubated with 10 million units of rluc alone vector or rluc-n or s1 respectively together with 35 l of a 30 protein ag ultralink resin suspension pierce thermo fisher scientific the ratio of rluc-n or s1 rluc vector was used to determine the specific antigen reactivity of camel sera hku8r-cov s1 protein was expressed from the pcaggs vector and was purified using s-tag resin generated in-house mouse anti-serum against purified protein was used as a positive control in lipsviral rna was extracted from camel nasal swabs using a viral rna extraction kit roche germany according to the manufacturers instructions three primer pairs were used to screen the samples in rtpcr two targeting the conserved rna-dependent rna polymerase gene of covs and another targeting the mers-cov s2 region 2021 twelve pools of rna were made from 139 mers-cov negative samples roughly every 10 samples were pooled and libraries for next-generation sequencing were prepared using illumina truseq mrna kit truseq stranded mrna library prep kit cat  rs-122-2101 following the manufacturers instructions the sequencing was performed on a hiseq 3000 sequencer and data was analysed using the galaxy platformall analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 25 two-tailed mannwhitney u exact test and two-tailed students t exact test were used to calculate the 95 confidence interval ci of positive rate the association p values between viral seropositive samples and camel information were calculated using chi-square test followed with yates correction two-tailed test and fishers exact testwe previously performed a nationwide serosurvey for mers-cov in kenyan camels using an in-house mers-cov rbd igg elisa plus a confirmatory vnt 14 a correlation in results obtained using the two methods was observed whereby almost all elisa positive sera were capable of neutralizing mers-cov 103105 981 our data revealed 584 of 891 6554 kenyan camel samples had mers-cov rbd antibodies figure 1a we then tested all camel sera using a mers-cov np-based elisa in contrast only 54 of 891 samples 604 or 48 of the rbd positive samples 822 were np positive figure 1a to confirm the finding we developed an additional antibody assay based on mammalian expressed mers-cov np using lips a fast and sensitive serological tool which has previously been successfully used in sads-cov serosurvey 1819 all np elisa positive sera were also positive in lips while those negative samples remained negative figure 1b this observation was confirmed by a mers-cov virus-based western blot using rbd positive samples two major structural proteins np and membrane protein were observed in the np positive group but not in the np negative group figure 1c and supplementary figure 1a above all only a small proportion of the mers-cov rbd positive serum samples were also np positive different to that observed in human infection cases 622 this observation indicated that the majority of the camels may only maintain np antibodies for a short time or be co-infected by another cov
in searching for possible new genotype of mers viruses that share the same or a related s but a different np we performed a cov np protein array serology test selected mers-cov rbd positive samples were analysed by western blot using np proteins from representative alpha and beta covs see method section the successful expression of these proteins was confirmed by anti-tag antibodies figure 2a no other cov besides hku8r-cov china strain np was detected in two out of three selected mers-cov np negative camel serum samples figure 2a and supplementary figure 1b in particular hku8r-cov np antibody was not cross-reactive with 229e-related cov which is also known to be enzootic in camels figure 2a hku8r-cov has previously been found only in miniopterus bats in china or kenya 2325
to further investigate the results observed in the western blot hku8r-cov np and s1 based lips assays were developed the lips results demonstrated clear hku8r-cov np positive in some camel sera consistent with western blot results figure 2b however no hku8r-cov s1 positives were found within the hku8r-cov np positive samples figure 2b to rule out the possible false-negative results using china hku8r-cov as detection antigen a kenyan bat hku8r-cov btky33 was also used results indicated that the above conclusion was not hku8r-cov strain-specific supplementary figure 2 the data indicates that some of the kenyan camels have both mers-cov s and hku8r-cov np antibodies we then performed a nationwide serosurvey for hku8r-cov in camels using a hku8r-cov np and s1 elisa of the 584 mers-cov rbd positive samples tested 73 125 were positive for hku8r-cov np figure 2c in contrast only 3 051 were seropositive for hku8r-cov s1 figure 2c the data suggested the idea of the co-infection of mershku8r-covs alternatively we cant rule out the existence of a chimeric mers-cov carrying mers-cov s gene but a np gene from hku8r-cov in kenyan camels figure 3 and supplementary table 1 although we cannot rule the possibility of a novel cov that was not detected in molecular assays but can cross-react with hku8r or mers coronavirus positive serum samples it is worth to mention another camel alphacoronaviruses 229e-like coronaviruses were previously found in camels 26 we then tested cross-reactivity of antibodies to the n proteins of hku8r and 229e as the two are closely related phylogenetically our data demonstrated only 1090 of the hku8r-cov np positive camel serum were also 229e-np positive supplementary figure 3a which was probably true positive for the later as np of the two viruses showed no cross-reactivity using positive control samples supplementary figure 3b
we then investigated factors that may associate with mers-cov positive for both s and np seropositivity and distribution which may also be important for the detection of this mershku8r-cov co-infection cases distribution of mers-cov sero-positive samples was not found to be associated with sex age birthplace migration or pregnancy of camels but may be associated with the breed p  003 supplementary table 2we also screened nucleic acid by rtpcr targeting the conserved regions of all known coronaviruses on 1422 camel nasal swabs collected from kenya 20162018 in addition 12 pooled camel nasal swabs 10 samples for each pool rna were also tested in next-generation sequencing ngs we found mers-cov nucleic acid by both rtpcr and ngs yet so far we have not found nucleic acid positive for hku8r-coronavirusin a nationwide mers-cov sero-surveillance of kenyan camels we have demonstrated that most of the mers-cov rbd positive samples 9178 were not mers-cov np positive by multiple serological assays in contrast 125 of the mers-cov rbd positive samples also carried np antibodies to hku8r-cov a virus that has only so far been found in bats for the first time we demonstrate the presence of a hku8r-cov infection in camelsour study is the first to compare the seroprevalence of mers-cov in camels using both s and np serological assays as one of the four major structural proteins in cov np is widely used as a diagnostic target due to its high abundance upon infection although np showed good reactivity with human mers patient serum in some studies s-based serological tests are recommended by who for diagnosis due to its greater specificity 2 in line with these recommendations most camel serosurveys were conducted using only s-based assays 3891113 in human cases samples showing neutralizing activity were also np positive 622 however our data clearly demonstrate that most of the mers-cov neutralizing samples were not mers-cov np positive in camels similarly unmatched s and np positive serological patterns have also been observed in another study using saudi arabia camel serum samples 13 a possible interpretation is that the duration of the np antibody responses is more short-lived than s antibody in camelsthe seropositive of hku8r-cov in camels is another example linking a bat cov to camels besides mers-cov and 229e-related coronavirus thereby strengthening the bat-camel connection theory 2728 the finding of two closely related neocov and predictpdf-2180 cov in bats suggested that mers-cov descended from an ancestral virus of african bats while the host switch from bats to dromedary camels likely occurred in africa years ago 272930 however there has been no other reported virus spillover from bats to camels beside this ancestral mers-cov and 229e-related coronaviruses our data demonstrated that the hku8r-cov np antibody is not caused by cross-reactive antibody responses to camel 229e our discovery of hku8r-cov in camels is therefore an important finding hku8r-cov was described first in hong kong and later in kenya and so far it has only been reported in miniopterus bat species 2325 kenyan bats carry multiple covs including sars-related hku2-related hku7-related hku8-related and hku9-related covs that may spillover to other species in rural areas where bats roost in close proximity to humans or are consumed by humans as bush meat 24it is worth mentioning that we observed much less hku8r-cov s protein igg antibodies in any of the hku8r-cov np positive and mers-cov rbd positive samples the chance of mershku8r-cov co-infected camels simultaneously lost both hku8r-cov s and mers-cov np antibodies should be low the presence of a chimeric mershku8r-cov would be a possible explanation although there could be other explanations for example camel may generate a different s and np antibody responses that resulted in a stronger s but weak and short-lasting np antibody titres it could also be two separated events of infection by mers-cov and hku8r-cov instead of a co-infection nonetheless even the occurrence of a chimeric mershku8r-cov is not surprising as it is known that cov genomes regularly undergo recombination during infection as observed in covs such as bat sars-related covs 31 three covs including mers-cov 229e-like and hku23-cov had also been reported to co-circulate in middle east camels increased chance of recombination 28 yet it is worth noting that recombination between an alpha-cov hku8r-cov eg and beta-cov mers-cov eg has never been reported our observation should be more supported by molecular evidence in future studiesmolecular detection of these serology-predicted novel covs containing mers-cov s protein is hampered by the lack of genetic sequences of this possible recombinant virus at the present time our western blot results suggest at least some of the mers-cov neutralizing samples did not have np or m protein antibodies it is unknown what genetic backbone these viruses will have for example viruses may maintain the mers-cov backbone and only replace the np gene with hku8r-cov or unidentified covs or vice versa in the latter example these viruses would have a hku8r-cov backbone with s gene replaced by the mers-cov with this hypothesis in consideration the current molecular diagnosis tools for mers-cov do not detect other genotype of mers-covs circulating in animals partially explaining the failure in our attempt to find molecular evidence of novel chimeric covs using qpcr targeting mers-cov s gene or metagenome ngs concerted efforts to identify and sequence these viruses are needed in future studiesin conclusion we showed evidence for hku8r-cov virus infection in camels in kenya it is possible that this virus co-circulates with mers-cov but the possibility of a mers-cov-hku8r recombinant virus cannot be excluded future research should seek to demonstrate molecular evidence of such virusesthere are cytologic findings associated with many bacterial rickettsial fungal and parasitic organisms of dogs and cats that may lead to a presumptive or definitive diagnosis cytologic evaluation of exudates bone marrow aspirates blood smears synovial fluid gastric brushings duodenal secretions urine prostatic washings airway washings fecal smears tissue imprints skin scrapings and aspiration biopsies is inexpensive and is considered a primary diagnostic procedure for many clinical infectious diseases stains routinely used for the diagnosis of infectious agents in small animal practice include wrights-giemsa diff-quik acid-fast and gram stains the laboratory should be contacted for specific specimen handling information based on the suspected organismcytological findings can be used to achieve a definitive diagnosis for some infectious agents for example identification of cryptococcus spp organisms on cytological evaluation of a lymph node aspirate from a cat with rhinitis confirms the diagnosis detection of a hemoplasma on cytological examination of a thin blood smear from an anemic cat or dog confirms the diagnosis polymerase chain reaction pcr assays can then be used to determine whether the organism is mycoplasma hemofelis m hemocanis or another one of the agents in the genussome infectious agents can be present in small numbers so failure to document an organism cytologically does not totally exclude the diagnosis low npv ehrlichia spp infections are examples of common infectious agents rarely documented cytologically these agents generally require results of serology and pcr to confirm exposure or current infection some organisms like respiratory mycoplasma spp are rarely documented cytologically because of their small size whereas other organisms require special stains for optimal visualization for example mycobacterium spp are not readily stained by rapid stains used in small animal practices and if macrophages or neutrophils are detected acid-fast staining is indicated to assess for the organisms within the cytoplasm of infected cells bacterial culture of all samples with increased numbers of neutrophils or macrophages should always be consideredbacteria fungi viruses and some protozoans can be cultured in general a positive culture can be used to establish a definitive diagnosis particularly if there is clinical illness and concurrent evidence of inflammation if the organism is easy to grow primarily bacteria culture is preferred over cytology or molecular diagnostic assays because culture may be combined with antimicrobial susceptibility testing to determine optimal antibiotic therapy successful culture is dependent on the collection of optimal materials without contamination and on transportation of materials in the most appropriate culture medium to the laboratory as quickly as possible to minimize organism death and nonpathogen overgrowthculture results of body systems with normal bacterial and fungal flora including the skin ears mouth nasal cavity trachea feces and vagina are the most difficult to interpret positive-culture results coupled with cytological evidence of inflammation suggest the organism is inducing disease culture of a single agent particularly if the organism is relatively resistant to antimicrobials is more consistent with a disease-inducing infection than if multiple antibiotic-susceptible bacteria are culturedfor some organisms culture is difficult or has never been accomplished for example the hemoplasmas of dogs and cats previously hemobartonella felis and h canis can be detected on the surface of red blood cells but have never been successfully cultured for other organisms culture takes several weeks to become positive ie bartonella spp or the techniques are cumbersome and not so widely available ie ehrlichia spp in these situations molecular diagnostic assays may be the optimal way to prove current infectionexamination of feces can be used to identify bacteria fungi and parasites that can be associated with diseases of the gastrointestinal table 1 and respiratory table 2 tracts the techniques used most frequently include direct saline solution and stained smears fecal flotation and the baermann technique the american association of feline practitioners wwwcatvetscom recommends performing at least a fecal flotation fecal or rectal cytology and direct smear on feces from cats with potentially infectious diarrhea2 these assays can easily be performed in the veterinary clinic the companion animal parasite council is an excellent source of information concerning these assays and the parasites that infest dog and cats wwwcapcvetorginfectious agents or their antigens can be detected in body fluids feces cells or tissues with immunologic techniques in general polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against the agent in question are used in a variety of different test methodologies including direct fluorescent antibody assay with cells or tissue agglutination assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa the sensitivity and specificity will vary among tests but are generally high for most assays the npv of most assays is high if performed on appropriate samples ie pretreatment positive results with these tests generally confirm infection however the ppv for disease varies by the agent and the assay for example many normal dogs and cats are positive for giardia antigen in feces and so a positive assay result in an animal with diarrhea does not prove disease causationin the united states commercially available antigen assays used most frequently for the detection of antigens in serum or plasma include blastomyces dermatitidis cryptococcus neoformans dirofilaria immitis and feline leukemia virus felv the cryptococcus neoformans latex agglutination procedure can also be performed on aqueous humor vitreous humor and cerebrospinal fluid csf cryptosporidium parvum antigen giardia spp antigen parvovirus antigen and clostridium perfringens and c difficile enterotoxin assays are available for use with feces parvovirus assays detect both canine and feline parvovirus antigen and may be positive transiently after administration of modified live vaccines3 4 most giardia antigen tests marketed for use with human feces and the test labeled for use with dog or cat feces detect the giardia assemblages that infect dogs or cats5 occasionally samples will be antigen-positive but cyst-negative on fecal flotation in this situation it is unknown whether the antigen test is falsely positive or the fecal flotation is falsely negative none of the currently available c parvum antigen tests marketed for use with human feces consistently detects c felis or c canis and so should not be used with feces from dogs and cats however a direct fluorescent antibody assay for human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis detects dog and cat strains and is available at most commercial laboratories clostridium spp enterotoxins can be detected in the stool of healthy dogs and dogs with diarrhea and so the ppv is 1006
immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical techniques are commercially available for the documentation of a variety of infectious disease agents these procedures are particularly valuable for the detection of viral diseases detection of agents present in small numbers and differentiation among agents with similar morphologic features tissues collected from animals with suspected infectious diseases can be evaluated by several different techniques for example focal feline infectious peritonitis granulomatous disease can be documented by immunohistochemical staining7 tissue samples should be aseptically placed in appropriate transport media for culture procedures or inoculated into laboratory animals if indicated before further handling gently blotting the cut edge of the tissue on a paper towel to remove excess blood and then lightly touching the tissue multiple times to a microscope slide make tissue impressions for cytological or immunocytological examination tissue specimens can then be frozen placed into 10 buffered formalin solution or placed into glutaraldehyde-containing solutions frozen specimens are generally superior for immunohistochemical staining and pcr routine histopathologic evaluation is performed on formalin-fixed tissues special stains can be used to maximize the identification of some infectious agents the clinician should alert the histopathology laboratory to the infectious agents most suspected to allow for appropriate stain selection glutaraldehyde-containing fixatives are superior to other fixatives for electron microscopic examination of tissues and this technique can be more sensitive than other procedures for demonstration of viral particlesassays to amplify dna and rna of infectious agents are among the newest organism demonstration techniques now commonly available to veterinary practitioners pcr assays are used to amplify small quantities of dna to detectable levels by use of a reverse transcriptase rt step rna is converted to dna therefore the technique can also be used to detect rna rt-pcr in general pcr is more sensitive than cytologic or histopathologic techniques and is comparable with culture and laboratory animal inoculation pcr assays are of great benefit for documentation of infections particularly if the organism in question is difficult to culture eg respiratory mycoplasma spp or cannot be cultured eg hemoplasmas specificity can be very high depending on the primers used in the reaction for example primers can be designed to detect one genus but not others primers can also be designed to identify only one species for example a pcr assay can be developed to detect all ehrlichia spp or just one species such as e canisbecause of the inherent sensitivity of the reaction pcr can give false-positive results if sample contamination occurs during collection or at the laboratory performing the procedure false-negative results can occur if the sample is handled inappropriately this is of particular importance for detection of some rna viruses by rt-pcr results may also be affected by treatment and it is therefore best to collect samples before administration of antimicrobial agents another potential problem is that minimal standardization exists among commercial laboratories offering pcr techniques and results may therefore vary between laboratories in addition minimal external quality control exists and so the veterinary practitioner must trust that the laboratory providing the assay is using appropriate controlsalthough pcr assays can be one of the most sensitive for documentation of infections positive test results do not always prove that the infection is resulting in clinical illness low ppv for example because the technique detects dna of both live and dead organisms positive test results may be achieved even if the infection has been controlled interpretation of test results for a single animal can be difficult if the targeted organism commonly infects the background population of healthy animals for example candidatus mycoplasma haemominutum dna can be amplified from approximately 15 of all cats whether anemic or healthy8 9 thus although pcr is the most sensitive way to document infection by this agent the ppv is actually very low in addition currently available pcr assays cannot discriminate between vaccine and field strains for some agents for example currently available pcr assays for fhv-1 also amplify modified live vaccine strains so a positive result does not even indicate presence of a pathogenic strain10 real-time pcr can be used to determine the amount of microbial dna in a sample it is possible that the dna load will correlate to the presence of disease for some agents based on these findings it is very important that small animal practitioners carefully assess the predictive values of currently available pcr assays as well as the expertise and reliability of the laboratory that will be performing the assays new pcr assays are being developed frequently but may not be required or optimal except for many canine and feline infectious disease agents the clinical use of commonly available pcr assays will be discussed throughout this articlea variety of different methods exist for detecting serum antibodies against infectious agents including complement fixation hemagglutination inhibition serum neutralization agglutination agar gel immunodiffusion indirect fluorescent antibody ifa elisa and western blot assays complement fixation hemagglutination inhibition serum neutralization and agglutination assays generally detect all antibody classes in a serum sample western blot immunoassay ifa and elisa can be adapted to detect specific immunoglobulin ig m igg or iga responsescomparison of igm iga and igg antibody responses against an infectious agent can be used to attempt to demonstrate recent or active infection in general igm is the first antibody produced after antigenic exposure with antibody class shift to igg occurring in days to weeks serum and mucosal iga immune responses have also been studied for some infectious agents including toxoplasma gondii feline coronaviruses and helicobacter felis
timing of antibody testing is important in general serum antibody tests in puppies and kittens cannot be interpreted as specific responses until at least 8 to 12 weeks of age because of the presence of antibodies from the dam passed to the puppy or kitten in the colostrum most infectious agents can induce disease within 3 to 10 days after initial exposure with the use of many assays serum igg antibodies are usually not detected until 1 to 2 weeks after initial exposure based on these facts falsely negative serum antibody tests during acute disease can be common in small animal practice if specific serum antibody testing is initially negative in an animal with acute disease repeat antibody testing should be performed in 2 to 3 weeks to assess for seroconversion documentation of increasing antibody titers is consistent with recent or active infection it is preferable to assess both the acute and convalescent sera in the same assay on the same day to avoid interassay variationdiagnostic use of some serologic tests are also limited because of the presence of antibodies induced by vaccination examples include feline coronaviruses some borrelia burgdorferi assays fhv-1 parvoviruses calicivirus and canine distemper virusthe clinician should interpret positive results in serum antibody tests only as evidence of present or prior infection by the agent in question recent or active infection is suggested by the presence of igm an increasing antibody titer over 2 to 3 weeks or seroconversion negative antibody result on the first test and positive antibody result on convalescent testing however detection of recent infection based on antibody testing does not always prove disease because of the agent in question conversely failure to document recent or active infection based on serologic testing does not exclude a diagnosis of clinical disease for example many cats with toxoplasmosis develop clinical signs of disease after serum antibody titers have reached their plateau the magnitude of antibody titer does not always correlate with active or clinical disease for example many cats with clinical toxoplasmosis have igm and igg titers that are at the low end of the titer scale conversely many healthy cats have igg titers greater than 116384 years after infection with toxoplasma gondii
some infectious agents induce disease of the eyes or central nervous system cns documentation of agent-specific antibodies in aqueous humor vitreous humor or csf can be used to support the diagnosis of infection of these tissues quantification of ocular and csf antibodies is difficult to interpret if serum antibodies and inflammatory disease are present serum antibodies leak into ocular fluids and csf in the face of inflammation detection of local production of antibodies within the eye or cns has been used to aid in a number of infectious agents including canine distemper virus infection feline toxoplasmosis and feline bartonellosis11 12
in summary there are organism demonstration techniques or antibody assays available for many infectious disease agents in pets with variable predictive values results of infectious agent assays should not be interpreted alone but should be combined with other parameters to document a clinical infectious disease includingappropriate signalment history and physical examination findingsclinical signs referable to the agentpositive cytology culture antigen assay pcr assay or serologic evidence of exposure to the agentexclusion of other causes of the clinical syndrome andresponse to treatment
the infectious disease agent in question is the likely cause of the clinical syndrome when these criteria are met however it is possible that the clinical syndrome may have spontaneously resolved during the treatment period in addition many antimicrobial drugs have other nonspecific effects for example doxycycline has antiinflammatory properties and so some apparent clinical responses may not have been from the antibiotic activity13
the purpose of the remaining part of the article is to use several common infectious disease agents to emphasize important points concerning use of molecular diagnostic assays in practicethe new names for hemobartonella felis are mycoplasma hemofelis candidatus mycoplasma haemominutum and candidatus m turicensis the new names for h canis are m hemocanis and candidatus m hematoparvum in cats m hemofelis is apparently more pathogenic than candidatus m haemominutum and candidatus m turicensis however fever and anemia have been documented in all 3 species in dogs the hemoplasmas are generally only associated with disease if the dog is immunosuppressed diagnosis of hemoplasma infections in dogs and cats is based on demonstration of the organism on the surface of erythrocytes on examination of a thin blood film or pcr assay organism numbers fluctuate and therefore blood film examination can be falsely negative 50 of the time8 the organism may be difficult to find cytologically particularly in the chronic phase thus pcr assays are the tests of choice because of sensitivity particularly if the cytological examination is negative both conventional and quantitative pcr assays are available and have similar sensitivity specificity and predictive values unfortunately dna copy numbers do not correlate to the presence of disease for the hemoplasmas however quantitative pcr assays can be used to monitor dna copy numbers during antimicrobial drug research studies samples should be obtained for pcr assays before antibiotics treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone may be indicated if any of the agents are detected by pcr in cats or dogs with fever or anemia additionally the american college of veterinary internal medicine recommends screening blood donor dogs or cats by hemoplasma pcr assays14 there is minimal clinical utility after hemoplasma pcr assay results because most animals do not become negative with treatmentdogs in the united states are known to be infected by ehrlichia canis e ewingii e chaffeensis anaplasma phagocytophilum a platys and neorickettsia risticii15 each of these agents can result in fever and cytopenias and the clinical syndrome is collectively known as ehrlichiosis the primary agent in the united states is e canis because of the distribution of rhipicephalus sanguineous whereas the prevalence of the other agents varies geographically cats may be infected by e canis-like organisms as well as by a phagocytophilum16 17 little is known about the other agents in these genera in regards to cats because the organisms are in different genera serological cross reactivity is variable thus although the clinical syndromes can be similar there is no single serological test to document all the infections and other than the commercially available kit there is no standardization among laboratories offering serology in addition some cats with e canis-like infection do not seroconvert16 dogs and cats with ehrlichiosis can be clinically ill before seroconversion cytological assessment of blood smears is usually negative and culture is expensive has poor sensitivity and is not readily available thus pcr assays for ehrlichia spp anaplasma spp and perhaps n risticii atypical ehrlichiosis in dogs should be performed on blood of dogs and cats with acute fever or cytopenias before treatment pcr assays can be designed to amplify each individual organism and can be offered in panels alternately primers are available to amplify all of the organisms in a single reaction and subsequent sequencing can be used to determine the infective species the predictive value of these pcr assays is currently unknown however it seems prudent to treat a clinically ill pcr-positive dog or cat dogs with ehrlichiosis can be followed by pcr to prove cure however infection can reoccur and so tick control should be maintained15 minimal information concerning the clinical use of repeated pcr testing of cats with these infections is available blood donors should be screened for ehrlichiaanaplasmaneorickettsia and if positive excluded from the program even if treated because of the difficulty in sterilizing the blood14
some dogs become clinically ill after exposure to rickettsia rickettsii and there are an additional 4 spotted fever group organisms in the united states that induce cross-reacting antibodies therefore antibodies against r rickettsii do not prove rocky mountain spotted fever cats can be infected by r felis and have demonstrated antibodies against r rickettsii we assayed 92 pairs of cat blood and flea extracts from alabama maryland and texas in a recent study in our laboratory we used pcr assays that amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene and the outer membrane protein b gene18 of the 92 pairs 62 of 92 674 flea extracts and none of the cat blood samples were positive for r felis dna in another study we identified r felis and r rickettsii antibody prevalence rates in cats with fever to be 56 and 66 respectively however neither organism was amplified from blood19 these results proved that cats were sometimes exposed but further data are required to determine the significance of disease associations rickettsia spp dna has been amplified from healthy dogs but the infective species are currently unknown20 the predictive values of rickettsia spp pcr assays in clinical syndromes in dogs and cats have not been establishedblood culture pcr assay on blood and serologic testing can be used to assess dogs or cats for bartonella spp infection21
bartonella vinsonii and b henselae infections are most common in dogs whereas b henselae and b clarridgeiae are most common in cats there are several other less common species that infect dogs and cats and not all of the species induce cross-reacting antibodies thus as for the ehrlichiaanaplasmaneorickettsia group pcr assays that amplify multiple bartonella species can be superior to serology if collected before treatment however a combination of culture and pcr may be required to detect some infections in dogs22 serologic testing can be used to determine whether an individual dog or cat has been exposed however both seropositive and seronegative animals can be bacteremic limiting the diagnostic use of serologic testing thus testing healthy cats or dogs for bartonella species infection is not currently recommended and should be reserved for those with suspected clinical bartonellosis however because bartonella spp infection is so common in healthy animals even positive-culture or pcr results do not prove clinical bartonellosis for example although we detected bartonella spp dna in more cats with fever than pair-matched cats without fever the healthy cats were still commonly positive23 treatment usually does not permanently eliminate infection and so there appears to be minimum clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment
cytauxzoon felis in clinically affected cats is usually easily identified on cytological examination of blood smears or splenic aspirates serologic testing is not commercially available pcr can be used to amplify organismal dna from blood or splenic aspirates from cytologically negative cats24 nonpathogenic c felis strains can be detected in the blood of healthy cats and therefore the ppv of pcr assays is less than 100 however some strains of the organism are extremely pathogenic and so it seems prudent to institute treatment in clinically ill positive cats whether there is clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment is unknown
babesia canis and b gibsoni infections occur in dogs of the united states there are no species that infect cats in this country serological assays are available for both organisms but positive test results do not prove anemia from babesia spp infection pcr assays are now commercially available for both organisms these assays should be considered in high-risk dogs with hemolytic anemia-like greyhounds pit bull terriers or dogs exposed to pit bull terriers25 the predictive values of babesia spp pcr assays are unknown but it seems prudent to institute treatment in clinically ill positive dogs it is unknown whether there are clinical benefits to repeating pcr assays after successful treatmentantibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus fiv are detected in serum in clinical practice most frequently by elisa comparisons between different tests have shown the results of most assays are comparable26 it is believed that infection is incurable once established thus presence of serum antibodies in unvaccinated cats indicates persistent infection clinical signs can occur before seroconversion in some cats and some infected cats never seroconvert thus false-negative reactions can occur results of virus isolation or rt-pcr on blood are positive in some antibody-negative cats virus isolation or rt-pcr on blood can also be performed to confirm infection however fiv is not present in the blood in high levels and so false-negative results are common27 thus the assay is not very accurate for distinguishing a vaccinated cat from a naturally exposed catmost cats with felv infection are antigenemic and therefore molecular diagnostic assays are not usually necessary in clinical practice however the use of newer sensitive rt-pcr assays have been used to accurately characterize the stages of infection although these assays do not have widespread commercial availability28
rna of both feline infectious peritonitis fip virus and feline enteric coronavirus fecv can be amplified from the blood and feces of cats and so positive test results do not always correlate with the development of fip amplification of the mrna of the m gene by rt-pcr has had mixed results in 2 studies performed to date a study demonstrated that 13 of 26 apparently normal cats were positive for fecv mrna in blood suggesting that the ppv of this assay for the diagnosis of fip was low29
the primary bacteria associated with gastrointestinal tract disease in cats and dogs include salmonella spp campylobacter spp clostridium spp and helicobacter spp the optimal diagnostic test for salmonella spp and campylobacter spp is culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing rather than pcr although little information is available in cats it appears in dogs that it is optimal to perform a combination of both pcr and enterotoxin assays on feces from those suspected to have c perfringens or c difficile infections30 however some healthy dogs can also be positive in all assays and therefore the ppv is not 100 helicobacter spp infection is suspected on cytological or histopathological detection of gastric spiral organisms and urease-positive test results on tissue biopsies pcr assays can be used to document the presence of helicobacter spp dna in tissues however helicobacter spp can be detected in the tissues of many healthy dogs and cats and therefore the ppv of assays for this organism group is low31 treatment usually does not permanently eliminate gastrointestinal bacterial infections resulting in minimum clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatmentthe most common enteric protozoans in dogs and cats include cryptosporidium spp giardia spp isospora spp and tritrichomonas fetus although infection is common it is unusual to find c felis or c canis after fecal flotation in cats because of the small size of the oocysts acid-fast staining of a thin fecal smear is cumbersome and insensitive and antigen assays that are titrated for use with human feces are inaccurate when used with canine or feline feces immunofluorescent antibody staining of a thin fecal smear with a commercially available kit for the detection of c parvum and g lamblia in people appears to detect most cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp in dog and cat feces this assay is commonly combined with fecal flotation by the author for the initial screening of cats with small bowel diarrhea and dogs with unexplained small bowel diarrhea that persists after routine therapeutic trials pcr assays have been shown to be more sensitive than ifa for detection of c felis in cats but little is known about sensitivity in the dog32 however because of the inherent sensitivity pcr assays are likely to detect a number of subclinical carriers and so the ppv will be less than 100 cryptosporidium felis and c canis are not considered to be significant zoonotic agents therefore positive pcr assay results are only potentially significant when detected in feces of dogs or cats with diarrhea33
cryptosporidium spp pcr assays are indicated in ifa-negative dogs or cats with unexplained small bowel diarrhea and when the genotype of cryptosporidium is to be determined treatment usually does not permanently eliminate infection and so there appears to be minimum clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatmentthe diagnosis of giardia spp infection is easy to achieve in dogs or cats with small bowel diarrhea with the combination of fecal flotation techniques and wet mount examination fecal antigen assays and the giardia ifa are also accurate fecal pcr assays can be inaccurate because of the presence of pcr inhibitors and should only be used when the genotype of giardia is to be determined34 treatment usually does not permanently eliminate giardia infection and reinfection can occur within days thus there appears to be no clinical benefit in testing healthy animals or repeating pcr assays after resolution of diarrheasome kittens and puppies with large bowel diarrhea are infected by toxoplasma fetus rare most clinically affected animals have cytological evidence of infection on wet mount examination in addition the organism is readily cultured from feces however pcr assays can be more sensitive than culture and results return more quickly subclinical carriers are common and therefore amplification of t fetus dna from feces does not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease poor ppv35 treatment may not eliminate infection and reinfection is common thus there appears to be little clinical benefit in testing healthy animals or repeating pcr assays after resolution of diarrheathe primary viral agents associated with gastrointestinal disease in cats include feline coronaviruses feline panleukopenia virus felv and fiv in dogs canine coronavirus canine distemper virus and canine parvoviruses are most common felv and fiv assays are generally performed on blood not feces coronaviruses in dog and cat feces can be documented by electron microscopy virus isolation or molecular assays rt-pcr can be used to detect fecv and fipv rna in feces of cats and canine coronavirus in feces of dogs however positive results do not prove feline infectious peritonitis in cats but merely the presence of a coronavirus36 in addition rt-pcr assay results cannot distinguish a cat or dog that is merely colonized with a coronavirus from one with diarrhea induced by a coronavirus enteric coronaviruses are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens with good husbandry and do not cause diarrhea in adults6 thus there appears to be no reason to routinely perform coronavirus rt-pcr assay on the feces from a dog or cat feline panleukopenia virus and canine parvoviruses can be detected in dog and cat feces by electron microscopy virus isolation canine parvovirus antigen assays and molecular diagnostic assays there appears to be no reason to routinely perform parvovirus pcr assays on canine and feline feces because fecal antigen assays are widely available easy to use and detect current strains of canine and feline parvoviruses4 other organisms like astroviruses and reoviruses may infect some animals but these agents have rarely been associated with disease thus whether specific diagnostic assays for these agents are needed is unknownof the bacteria that have been associated with respiratory disease in dogs and cats pcr assays are now routinely available for bordetella bronchiseptica mycoplasma spp streptococcus zooepidemicus and chlamydophila felis although b bronchiseptica is a well-defined primary pathogen in dogs the organism can be isolated from many clinically normal cats37 thus the ppv of culture and pcr assay are low in cats bordetella bronchiseptica is easily grown and culture is superior to pcr for this agent because antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be performed on isolates the organism is not usually eliminated by treatment and therefore posttherapeutic follow-up culture or pcr assay has minimal benefits chlamydophila felis is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of conjunctivitis and rhinitis although it is not a common cause of lower airway disease the organism is difficult to culture and so detection of microbial dna by pcr assays can be useful clinically however not all pcr-positive cats are clinically ill and so the ppv can be low pcr assays results can be used to prove a cattery has been cleared of the infection after treatment38
mycoplasma spp organisms are normal commensal organisms of the mucous membranes of multiple species including dogs and cats mycoplasma felis has been associated primarily with conjunctivitis in cats but is suspected as a primary cause of rhinitis in cats as well there are multiple mycoplasma spp of dogs and cats and the pathogenic potential for most is unknown if other primary diseases are present even nonpathogenic mycoplasma spp may be associated with the disease process39 40
mycoplasma spp culture can be difficult and antimicrobial susceptibility is not provided by most laboratories therefore mycoplasma spp pcr assays have at least moderate clinical utility genus-specific primers should probably be used because the pathogenic potential of all mycoplasma spp is not known however the ppv of the assays is likely to be low because mycoplasma spp are common flora the organism is not usually eliminated by treatment and so posttherapeutic follow-up culture or pcr assay has minimal benefitthe most common viruses associated with feline respiratory disease are feline calicivirus fcv and feline herpesvirus 1 fhv-140 both viruses are extremely common in cats particularly those from crowded environments like pet stores catteries and shelters adenovirus 2 parainfluenza influenza respiratory coronavirus canine distemper virus and canine herpesvirus have the most potential to induce respiratory disease in dogs there are many fcv and mutations resulting in new strains are common41 this organism is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis stomatitis and conjunctivitis fcv is less commonly associated with polyarthritis lower airway disease in kittens and virulent systemic disease42 virus isolation can be used to document current infection but takes at least several days for results to return and is not performed by all laboratories because of widespread exposure and vaccination the ppv of serological tests is poor rt-pcr assays can be used to amplify calicivirus rna with quick and rapid return of results however these assays also amplify vaccine strains of fcv accordingly fcv rna can be amplified from samples collected from normal carrier cats as well as clinically ill cats and therefore fcv rt-pcr assays may have poor ppv for example the presence of fcv rna failed to correlate to the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats in a study from our laboratory43 in addition amplification of fcv rna cannot be used to prove virulent systemic calicivirus infection results of fcv rt-pcr can also be falsely negative and so assays may have poor npv treatment does not eliminate fcv infection and so there is no benefit to follow-up culture or rt-pcr testingfhv-1 is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis stomatitis conjunctivitis keratitis and facial dermatitis the ppv of serological tests is poor because of widespread exposure and vaccination fhv-1 infection can be documented by direct fluorescent staining of conjunctival scrapings virus isolation or pcr fhv-1 dna can be amplified from conjunctival cells of approximately 25 of healthy cats and therefore the ppv of pcr assay for this agent is low44 currently used pcr assays also detect vaccine strains of fhv-1 further lessening the ppv10 in one study in the authors laboratory presence of fhv-1 dna failed to correlate to the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats43 quantitative pcr may ultimately prove to correlate to the presence or absence of disease but failed to correlate to presence of conjunctivitis in one study in the authors laboratory45 the npv of the fhv-1 pcr assays is also in question because many cats that are likely to have fhv-1associated disease are negative this may relate to clearance of fhv-1 dna from tissues by the immune reaction tissue biopsies have greater sensitivity than conjunctival swabs fhv-1 dna can be amplified from aqueous humor of some cats but whether this indicates fhv-1 associated uveitis is unknown46 treatment does not eliminate fhv-1 infection and so there is no benefit to follow-up culture or pcr testingthe viruses in dogs most commonly associated with respiratory disease adenovirus 2 parainfluenza influenza respiratory coronavirus canine distemper virus and canine herpesvirus generally have an acute course of disease47 48 therefore the syndrome is often resolving before the return of diagnostic test results from virus isolation or molecular diagnostic assays results of molecular diagnostic assays can also be negative by the time clinical signs develop in addition there are no specific treatments for the viral respiratory agents of dogs and so a definitive diagnosis is not required to optimize the treatment plan thus use of these assays has low clinical utility in individual dogs however when respiratory outbreaks occur in populations of dogs determining whether the primary agent is bacterial or viral may help in the planning of treatment bacteria or preventative programs
toxoplasma gondii dogs and cats or neospora caninum dogs is associated with interstitial pneumonia that can progress to alveolar disease49 serological tests are available for both organisms but have low ppv because of high seroprevalence rates in normal animals dogs and cats with active disease may have tachyzoites present on cytological examination of airway washings however the agents can also be obscured by the inflammatory reaction in these situations pcr may be used to amplify the microbial dna50 pcr can also be used to differentiate t gondii from n caninuma variety of different serological assay and organism demonstration assays are available to aid in the diagnosis of the most common fungal causes of respiratory disease in dogs and cats including aspergillus spp blastomyces dermatitidis coccidioides immits cryptococcus neoformans and histoplasma capsulatum51 although molecular diagnostic assays have been evaluated in limited numbers of research studies there is minimal information concerning predictive values therefore the majority of clinical cases are diagnosed by other methods at this timeas of may 11 2020 more than 285000 deaths have been attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 millions of infections by sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for covid-19 have been reported though its full extent has yet to be determined due to limited testing2 government interventions to slow viral spread have disrupted daily life and economic activity for billions of people strategies to ease restraints on human mobility and interaction without provoking major resurgence of transmission and mortality will depend on accurate estimates of population levels of infection and immunity3 current testing for the virus largely depends on labor-intensive molecular techniques4 individuals with positive molecular tests represent only a small fraction of all infections given limited deployment and the brief time window when pcr testing has the highest sensitivity57 the proportion of undocumented cases in the original epidemic focus was estimated to be as high as 868 and asymptomatic infections are suspected to play a substantial role in transmission914widely available reliable antibody detection assays would enable more accurate estimates of sars-cov-2 prevalence and incidence on february 4 2020 the secretary of the united states department of health and human services issued emergency use authorization eua for diagnosis of sars-cov-215 allowing nucleic acid detection and immunoassay tests to be offered based on manufacturer-reported data without formal fda clearance16 in response dozens of companies began to market laboratory-based immunoassays and point-of-care tests rigorous comparative performance data are crucial to inform clinical care and public health responseswe conducted a head-to-head comparison of serology tests available to our group  comprised of immunochromatographic lateral flow assays lfas and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas our evaluation includes performance by time from symptom onset and disease severity our goal is to provide well-controlled performance data to help guide their potential development and deploymentthis study was approved by institutional review boards at the university of california san francisco ucsfzuckerberg san francisco general hospital zsfg and massachusetts general hospital mghthe study population included individuals with symptomatic infection and positive sars-cov-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs who had remnant serum and plasma specimens in clinical laboratories serving the ucsf and zsfg medical center networks we included multiple specimens per individual but no more than one sample per time interval 15 610 1115 1620 and 20 days after symptom onset if an individual had more than one specimen for a given time interval only the later specimen was included for

other respiratory viruses biofire filmarray biofire diagnostics salt lake city ut and 32 with negative results by sarscov-2 rt-pcr we based minimum sample size calculations on expected binomial exact 95 confidence limits a total of 288 samples were included in the final analysis including 128 from 79 sars-cov-2 rt-pcr-positive individuals some specimens were exhausted during the analysis and were

prior to adding the recommended volume to the lfa cartridgeten lateral flow assays were evaluated etable 1 at the time of testing cartridges were labeled by randomized sample location plate well the appropriate sample volume was transferred from the plate to the indicated sample port followed by provided diluent following manufacturer instructions the lateral flow cartridges were incubated for the recommended time at room temperature before readings each cartridge was assigned a semi-quantitative score 0 for negative 1 to 6 for positive for test line intensity by two independent readers blinded to specimen status and to each others scores efigure 117 for some cartridges deepblue ucp bioperfectus the positive control indicator failed to appear after addition of diluent in a significant fraction of tests for these tests two further drops of diluent were added to successfully recover control indicators in all affected tests these results were included in analyses during

samples binomial exact 95 confidence intervals were calculated for all estimates analyses were conducted in r 363 and sas 94sars-cov-2-positive individuals in the ucsfzsfg study ranged from 22 to 90

without icu care and 37 required icu care there had been no reported deaths at the time of chart reviewthe percentage of specimens testing positive rose with increasing time from symptom onset table 2 figure 1a reaching the highest levels in the 1620 and 20 day time intervals the highest detection rate was achieved by combining igm and igg results figure 1b however 95 confidence intervals for later time intervals showed substantial overlap with those for earlier intervals figure 1b four assays bioperfectus premier wondfo in-house elisa achieved 80 positivity in the later two time intervals 1620 and 20 days while maintaining 95 specificity some tests were not performed on a subset of specimens due exhausted sample material which may have affected reported percent positivity igm detection was less consistent than igg for nearly all assays kappa agreement statistic ranged from 095 to 099 for igg and 081100 for igm for standardized intensity score and training etable 2 and efigure 2 although variability in mean band intensities exists among different assays the rate of sample positivity was generally consistent figure 2we observed a trend towards higher percent positivity by lfa for patients admitted to icu compared to those with milder disease but the specimen numbers per time interval were low limiting statistical power efigure 3test specificity in pre-covid-19 samples ranged

were seen in 308 1239 and scores of 46 were seen in 77 339we evaluated the tradeoff between percent positivity and specificity as a function of lfa reader score changing the positive lfa threshold from 1 to 2 decreased the mean overall percent positivity across tests from 672 range 579754 to 578 range 447656 and increased the average specificity from 942 range 8431000 to 981 range 9441000 efigure 4 an independent study at mgh compared three lfas of which biomedomics was also assessed in the current study etable 3 overall both studies showed a trend for increased detection of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies with increased time from symptom onset however the mgh study displayed increased specificity with lower percent positivity at early timepoints after symptom onset mgh positivity thresholds were set higher to prioritize test specificity efigure 4bca set of specimens obtained during the covid-19 outbreak that had negative sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing andor alternative respiratory pathogen diagnoses demonstrated higher numbers of positive results compared to the pre-covid-19 sample set figure 2c five specimens had positives results by 3 tests all with respiratory symptoms and concurrent negative sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing figure 2c arrows one patient was positive on 8 different tests including the in-house elisa in this limited panel no consistent pattern of cross-reactivity was identified in samples from individuals with non-sars-cov-2 respiratory viruses including 2 strains of seasonal coronavirus 1 coronavirus oc43 3 coronavirus hku1agreement between results of lfas with those of igg and igm epitope elisas ranged from 757856 while agreement with the in-house elisa ranged from 835948 figure 3a lfa band intensity scores showed a direct correlation with elisa sco values figure 3bthis study describes test performance for 12 covid-19 serology assays on a panel of 128 samples from 79 individuals with pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and 108 pre-covid-19 specimens for each test we quantified detection of igm andor igg antibodies by time period from onset of symptoms and assessed specificity and cross-reactivity we hope these data will inform the medical community public health efforts and governmental institutions considering sars-cov-2 serological testing this study also seeks to provide feedback to manufacturers about areas of success and necessary improvement there is no gold standard to identify true seropositive blood samples the extent and time-course of antibody development are not fully understood as yet and may vary between different populations even among rt-pcr-confirmed caseswe focused on comparisons of percent positivity by time interval rather than reporting the sensitivity of each assay as expected percent positivity rose with time after symptom onset562124 high rates of positive results were not reached until at least 2 weeks into clinical illness diagnosis at time of symptom onset thus remains dependent on viral detection methods the assays showed a trend to higher positive rates within time intervals for more severe disease but this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the limited data from ambulatory cases the majority of samples 20 days post-symptom onset had detectable anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies suggesting good to excellent sensitivity for all evaluated tests in hospitalized patients three or more weeks into their disease course however well-powered studies testing ambulatory or asymptomatic individuals including performance with capillary blood will be essential to guide appropriate use of serologyour data demonstrate specificity greater than 95 for the majority of tests evaluated and 99 for 2 lfas wondfo sure biotech and the in-house elisa adapted from amanat et al 202018 we observed moderate-to-strong positive bands in several pre-covid-19 blood donor specimens some of them positive by multiple assays suggesting the possibility of non-specific binding of plasma proteins non-specific antibodies or cross-reactivity with other viruses three of the pre-covid-19 specimens 28 were scored positive by more than three assays intriguingly the fraction of positive tests was higher in a set of recent specimens obtained during the covid-19 outbreak from individuals undergoing respiratory viral workup many with negative sars-cov-2 rt-pcr five of these 96 had positive results by more than three assays without relation to a specific viral pathogen suggesting non-specific reactivity andor missed covid-19 diagnoses one specimen was positive by 8 of 12 assays including the in-house elisa the patient was 90 years old and presented with altered mental status fever and ground glass opacities on chest radiological imaging sars-cov-2 rt-pcr was negative and ancillary laboratory testing suggested a urinary tract infection this case could represent covid-19 not detected by rt-pcr reinforcing the importance of caution in interpreting negative molecular results as ruling out the infection appropriate algorithms for serology testing including confirmatory or reflexive testing have yet to be determined these algorithms will be affected by test performance characteristics and prevalence of disease as well pretest probability of infectionimportantly we still do not know the extent to which positive results by serology reflect a protective immune response25 future functional studies are critical to determine whether specific antibody responses predict virus neutralization and protection against re-infection until this is established conventional antibody assays should not be used as predictors of future infection riskhigh specificity testing is crucial in low-prevalence settings one approach to increase specificity would employ confirmatory testing with an independent assay perhaps recognizing a distinct epitope or antigen our comparison of ucsf and mgh data suggests that reclassifying faint bands as negative or inconclusive changes test performance characteristics by increasing specificity albeit at the expense of sensitivity however the subjectivity of calling faint bands by individual readers may be difficult to standardize without specific control materials operator training andor objective methods of analyzing lfas in the clinical setting these parameters and protocols should be independently assessed and validated by clinical laboratories for operation under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia26our study also reinforces the need for assay validation using standardized sample sets with 1 known positives from individuals with a range of clinical presentations at multiple time points after onset of symptoms 2 pre-covid-19 outbreak samples for specificity and 3 samples from individuals with other viral and inflammatory illnesses as cross-reactivity controls coordinated efforts to validate and ensure widespread availability of such standardized sample sets would facilitate effective utilization serology test performance data will be available on a dedicated website httpscovidtestingprojectorg current and future studies by our group and others will provide an essential evidence base to guide serological testing during the covid-19 pandemicinfectious diseases should be on the differential list for most problems especially those with fever or signs of inflammation history physical examination findings and routine clinical pathologic testing are seldom pathognomonic for an infectious cause but they help the clinician rank differential diagnoses and develop a logical diagnostic planhistorical findings can increase the degree of suspicion for infectious diseases exposure to other infected animals or contaminated fomites is important for agents with direct transmission such as those inducing respiratory disease eg feline herpesvirus 1 canine bordetellosis or gastroenteritis eg canine and feline giardiasis canine and feline parvovirus infection potential exposure to vectors eg mosquitoes for dirofilariasis ticks for lyme borreliosis ixodes spp ehrlichiosis rhipicephalus sanguineus rocky mountain spotted fever rmsf dermacentor spp babesiosis r sanguineus or appropriate travel history eg coccidioidomycosis in the southwest rmsf in the southeast blastomycosis in the mississippi missouri and ohio river valleys can also suggest an infectious disease vaccination history deworming history and determination of whether other animals or people in the environment are also affected can aid in ranking infectious diseases on a differential diagnoses listphysical examination findings may suggest an infectious cause infectious agents can induce fever lymphadenomegaly as a result of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can be infectious in origin hepatosplenomegaly can be caused by immunologic stimulation induced by chronic intracellular infections eg ehrlichiosis brucellosis endogenous uveitis commonly occurs after infections by feline immunodeficiency virus fiv feline infectious peritonitis fip virus toxoplasmosis and systemic mycoses mucopurulent discharges can suggest primary or secondary bacterial infections certain infectious diseases cause specific abnormalities such as dendritic ulcers feline herpesvirus 1 chorea mycolonus canine distemper virus or testicular swelling plus pain canine brucellosisfinally clinicopathologic abnormalities can suggest disease caused by infectious agents neutrophilic leukocytosis particularly if found concurrently with a left shift or degenerative neutrophils see chapter 4 is consistent with an infectious cause of disease gram-negative sepsis is suggested by leukopenia with a degenerative left shift monocytosis can be induced by persistent infection with a number of intracellular agents that result in persistent infection polyclonal eg multiple infectious causes or monoclonal gammopathies eg usually induced by neoplasia rarely associated with canine ehrlichiosis may suggest chronic immune stimulation neutrophils in aqueous humor cerebrospinal fluid csf synovial fluid or urine may indicate inflammation induced by infectious agentscytologic examination of exudates blood film tissue imprint aspiration biopsy or wet mount of hair is indicated when bacterial and fungal diseases and occasionally rickettsial and viral diseases are suspectedinexpensive readily available and may allow rapid confirmation and identification of an infectious agent assists in establishing normal flora and contaminants versus infection eg interpretation of relative numbers of bacteria and yeasts in the ear canal gives visualization of relative numbers of organisms at time of collection culture results may be misleading in terms of fast- or slow-growing bacteriainfectious agents cannot always be found eg ehrlichiosis haemobartonellosis infections with numbers of organism that are below sensitivity level of cytology sometimes a presumptive cytologic diagnosis must be confirmed by other methods eg histopathology culture and cytology is of limited value in detecting viral inclusions except in brief viremic stages of canine distemperdischarges from animals with suspected bacterial disease should be placed on a microscope slide air dried fixed and stained with both grams and romanowskys-type stains see chapter 16 the examination is started on low power 10x magnification with oil immersion 100x used for inspection of bacterial morphologic features ie rods cocci and grams stain characteristics ie gram-positive blue or gram-negative pink the primary disadvantage of grams staining is that gram-negative bacteria may be difficult to find because background material stains pink it is easier to find bacteria dark-blue stain and easier to study morphologic detail of other cells ie inflammatory cells using romanowskys-type stains grams staining may be variable organisms in body fluids may stain differently from those grown on a blood agar plate grams stain demonstrates the gram-positive branching filaments of actinomyces spp and nocardia spp see color plate 4c acid-fast stains can be used for mycobacterium spp and to help differentiate nocardia spp acid-fast from actinomyces sppsome bacteria have characteristic morphologic features large rod-form bacteria containing spores found on fecal cytology of dogs or cats with diarrhea suggest clostridium perfringens color plate 4f see chapter 9 bipolar-staining gram-negative coccobacilli found in aspirates of inflamed cervical lymph nodes from cats in the southwest or west suggest yersinia pestis short spirochetes found on fecal cytology of animals with diarrhea suggest campylobacteriosis spirochetes found on cytology of gastric mucosa of vomiting animals suggest helicobacteriosisto demonstrate inclusion bodies in acute feline chlamydial conjunctivitis conjunctival scrapings are obtained with a flat spatula smeared on a slide stained with romanowskys-type stains and examined for intracytoplasmic aggregations of chlamydophila felis previously chlamydiamorulae of ehrlichia spp are rare in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells ehrlichia canis neutrophils ehrlichia ewingii anaplasma phagocytophila previously e equi or platelets ehrlichia platys mycoplasma haemofelis cats only m haemominutum cats only haemobartonella canis cytauxzoon felis cats only and babesia spp sometimes infect canine or feline erythrocytesfor demonstration of cheyletiella spp a piece of transparent adhesive tape is gently pressed against areas with crusts or dandruff and then placed on a microscope slide next the hair is clipped mineral oil is placed on the skin and on a microscope slide and the skin is scraped using a blunt no 10 scalpel blade for skin scrapings to look for demodex spp the skin should be immobilized and mites expressed from follicles by pinching and scraping the extruded material for scrapings to look for sarcoptes spp or cheyletiella spp the scraping is continued more superficially inducing a mild capillary ooze over a larger surface area after transfer of the scraping the microscope slide field is scanned at 10x for mitesfor identification of dermatophytes hairs are plucked from the periphery of a lesion placed on a microscope slide and covered with 10 to 20 potassium hydroxide to clear debris the slide is then heated not boiled and examined under the 10x or 40x objective to search for hyphae spores conidia budding yeasts and fungus-induced damage eg swollen or broken hair shafts the 40x objective is used to identify arthrospores dense aggregates of spherical structures that may cover the hair shaft see color plate 3c failure to find arthrospores does not rule out dermatomycosis culture is more sensitive for diagnosis of dermatophytosis see fungal cultureromanowskys-type stains eg wrights are used in preference to wet-mount preparations and ink when looking for fungi other than dermatophytes see chapter 16 romanowskys-type stains are also useful in identifying yeasts such as blastomyces dermatitidis histoplasma capsulatum sporothrix schenckii coccidioides immitis or cryptococcus neoformans see color plate 4e in exudates csf lymph node aspiration cytology or transtracheal aspiration cytologycanine distemper virus inclusions in lymphocytes neutrophils or erythrocytes color plates 2d and 2e are diagnostic of infection but are only present transiently so false-negative results are common rarely fip-inducing strains of coronavirus result in transient intracytoplasmic inclusions in circulating neutrophilsculture and antimicrobial susceptibility is indicated in most suspected bacterial diseases table 15-1
 especially when clinical syndromes have been resistant to medications remember skin and mucosal surfaces have a resident microflora table 15-2
 therefore care must be taken to avoid contaminationusually allows the most effective treatment to be administeredrequires time for agents to grow some organisms are fastidious or have special culture requirements the expense and ease of contaminating or making inactivate cultures rendering results worthlessthe site of skin puncture should be prepared as for blood culture see discussion in following section if pyothorax or peritonitis seems likely but fluid cannot be aspirated lavage see chapter 10 is indicated because mixed infections are common and pure anaerobic infections may occur aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be performedblood cultures are indicated in suspected bacterial endocarditis or septicemia a large vein prepared surgically with sequential iodine and alcohol scrubs is used for three blood culture specimens obtained during a febrile episode over a 24-hour period in dogs with suspected endocarditis culture of fewer than three specimens significantly decreases the chance of positive results at least 5 ml of blood is placed directly into transport media
that will support the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and it is incubated at 20c for 24 hours clotted blood or blood containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or citrate are unacceptable because it decreases isolation of organisms bartonella spp are exceptions they can be cultured from edta tubes if a patient is critically ill and sepsis is suspected three cultures should be obtained over 1 to 3 hours before antimicrobial therapy is instituted because the urinary system is a common portal of entry for bacteria into the body urine is often cultured in patients when the source of septicemia or bacterial endocarditis is unknownbacterial infection of the central nervous system cns is uncommon even when infection occurs low numbers of organisms make cytology and culture low-yield procedures if increased numbers of neutrophils and increased protein are detected in csf see chapter 14 however aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are indicated csf should be placed in transport media
and delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture should be performed when bacterial infection of the cns is suspectedconjunctival culture should be performed before topical anesthesia or application of fluorescein stain by rolling a moistened sterile swab over the conjunctiva ocular paracentesis is necessary for intraocular cultureprimary bacterial gastroenteritis occasionally occurs salmonella spp campylobacter spp c perfringens and e coli are important genera these organisms can also be isolated from normal animals however salmonella spp and campylobacter spp can cause small or mixed bowel diarrhea c perfringens is usually associated with large bowel diarrhea approximately 2 to 3 g of fresh feces should be submitted to the laboratory for optimal results if delayed transport of feces to the laboratory is expected the clinician should consult the laboratory for appropriate transport media because these organisms have special culture requirements the laboratory must be notified of the suspected pathogen a positive culture for c perfringens does not prove it was the cause of disease because not all c perfringens produce enterotoxinurine obtained by cystocentesis is preferred for urine culture if a patient is severely thrombocytopenic  50000l or if cystocentesis cannot be performed catheterization or a midstream-voided sample is acceptable quantitative culture is needed isolation of bacteria should always be assessed concurrently with the urine sediment rarely difficult to diagnose urinary tract infections require maceration and culture of a bladder wall biopsy specimen calculi should be crushed with a sterile mortar and pestle and cultured culture for mycoplasma spp or candida spp should be performed if pyuria is identified in absence of calculi masses and aerobic bacteriaculture of the third fraction of an ejaculate preferred or prostatic massage is recommended for prostatic culture culture of the second fraction of an ejaculate is recommended for testicular culture culture of prostatic or testicular material retrieved by aspiration or biopsy can also be performed prostatic massage and closed prostatic aspiration or biopsy should be avoided in dogs with suspected prostatic abscesses obtaining distal urethral specimens for quantitative culture before and after ejaculation may help avoid confusion caused by urethral contamination anaerobic culture of urine or prostatic fluid is rarely usefulin superficial pyoderma hair is clipped from the surrounding area but disinfection is not attempted a pustule is ruptured with a sterile fine-gauge needle and a swab of pus is cultured in deep pyoderma hair surrounding the lesion is clipped and the area is disinfected with an antiseptic the lesion is squeezed to express exudate which is collected on a swab gloves should be wornfor culture of ears a sterile otoscope cone is inserted to the level of the horizontal canal and the ear is swabbed through the cone when middle-ear infection is suspected the animal is anesthetized and material for culture is retrieved by myringotomy by penetration of the tympanum with a sterile csf needle placed through a sterile otoscope coneno normal flora exists in musculoskeletal tissues dogs with radiographic evidence of diskospondylitis should be evaluated for brucella canis infection serologically see serologic tests for bacterial infections intervertebral joints can be cultured after fluoroscopically guided aspiration or when decompressive spinal surgery is required most cases of diskospondylitis develop after hematogenous spread of bacteria from an extravertebral source blood and urine are commonly cultured from patients with diskospondylitis staphylococcus spp are commonly involveddogs or cats with suppurative arthritis with or without cytologic visualization of bacteria should have the synovial fluid cultured for aerobes and mycoplasma spp see chapter 10 likelihood of positive culture results increases if the synovial fluid contains degenerative neutrophils l-form bacteria usually cannot be grown from joint fluid via routine culture techniques synovial biopsy for culture plus histopathologic evaluation for l-form bacteria is more sensitive than only culture of fluid borrelia burgdorferi is almost never isolated by routine culture from joints of dogs with lyme diseasein osteomyelitis culture of fistulous tracts is less sensitive than culture of affected bone culture for infectious myositis is seldom performed unless suspicion for an anaerobic infection eg clostridium spp is based on foul odor subcutaneous sc emphysema or empyema the clinician can better evaluate for other infectious myopathies eg toxoplasmosis leptospirosis using serologic testing or pcr assayslower airway specimens are best obtained by transtracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage during bronchoscopy fine-needle pulmonary aspiration biopsy can be used but carries more risk see chapter 11 bacteria can be isolated from the trachea in some clinically healthy dogs these bacteria are probably transient common isolates are listed in table 15-2 because many organisms isolated from normal dogs have also been associated with lower respiratory tract inflammation all transtracheal aspiration samples should be evaluated by culture antimicrobial susceptibility and cytology with cytology the clinician should look for squamous cells coated with bacteria which indicates oropharyngeal contamination see figure 11-10 bacteria should not be considered significant unless accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation mycoplasma spp have been isolated in pure culture from lower airways of patients with clinical signs of respiratory disease randolph et al 1993 chandler and lappin 2002 culture for mycoplasma spp should be performed on all transtracheal aspiration samples these samples need to be transported to the laboratory in amies medium or modified stuarts bacterial transport medium mycoplasma spp culture should be specifically requestednasal specimens are best obtained from nasal lavage core biopsy or by passing a swab through a sterile otoscope cone see chapter 11 the clinician can best obtain pharyngeal specimens using a guarded swab taken during pharyngoscopy nasal and pharyngeal cultures can be difficult to interpret because of extensive normal flora in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx see table 15-2for aerobic culture no special transport medium is required if the swab remains moist and can be inoculated onto the culture medium within 3 hours swabs containing liquid
or gel transport
media are frequently used however routine cultures can be safely stored in transport media at room temperature for up to 4 hours after this time overgrowth is a potential problem because of various growth rates of different organisms refrigerated routine specimens can be stored in transport media for at least 2 days tissue samples can be refrigerated for up to 2 days fluids eg urine can be safely stored at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours refrigerated for 24 hours and refrigerated in transport media for 72 hours jones 1998 quantitative culture is not accurate for fluids stored in transport media because of artifactual dilutionfor anaerobic culture fluid should be aspirated into a syringe the needle capped with a rubber stopper and the sample inoculated onto culture medium within 10 minutes of collection transport media that support the growth of anaerobic bacteria are available
but are not ideal for fastidious bacteroides spp and fusobacterium spp with these limitations samples can be refrigerated for 2 days in an appropriate transport mediumblood agar plates grow most routine bacterial pathogens a biplate containing blood agar and macconkeys agar is frequently used the common anaerobic culture medium is thioglycolate the decision to perform in-office testing instead of using a commercial laboratory is based on caseload and available equipment with the exception of blood and feces the majority of culture procedures can be performed in office readers are referred elsewhere for details of equipment and operation of an in-office microbiology laboratory hirsh and ruehl 1986sensitivity testing gives an in vitro estimation of suitability of a given concentration of an antimicrobial agent two techniques are used 1 the dilution test and 2 the disk diffusion testthis test is quantitative and determines the least amount of antimicrobial needed to prevent growth of a microorganism minimum inhibitory concentration mic quantitative susceptibility testing is indicated when antimicrobial dosing schedules need to be monitored closely eg gentamicin or when disk test results are inapplicable equivocal or unreliable eg slow-growing organisms confirmation of susceptibility to polymyxins confirmation of susceptibility or resistance to given doses of aminoglycosides other indications include anaerobes and testing for synergism or antagonism between antimicrobialsmay be effective even though disk diffusion techniques suggest otherwise eg antibiotics concentrated in urineexpense inability to perform in office and need to determine if required concentrations of a certain antibiotic are feasible ideally blood concentrations of drugs should be more than four times the mic and urine concentrations 10 to 20 times the mic mic sensitivity for topically administered antimicrobials is seldom determined because these methods are based on blood or urine concentrationsthis is the most widely used method in clinical practice ie kirby-bauer technique a zone of inhibition of bacterial growth is noted around a disk containing a fixed amount of antibiotic the procedure is qualitative and allocates organisms to the sensitive susceptible intermediate indeterminate or resistant categorysimplicity and suitability for most routine cultures can be performed in office and applicability for rapidly growing organisms eg enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureusnot suitable for slow-growing organisms and anaerobes inaccuracy in predicting susceptibility of poorly diffusing antibiotics eg polymyxins factors that influence the test eg ph and thickness of the medium concentration of organisms incubation time must be standardized it is imperative that proper procedures be followed to avoid errors in diagnosisartifacts result from improper sample collection ie wrong sample contamination improper sample transport failure to notify the laboratory of suspected pathogens eg salmonella spp anaerobic bacteria campylobacter spp mycoplasma spp recent antibiotic treatment and culture for a secondary rather than a slow-growing primary pathogen ie insufficient duration of culture failure to grow fastidious anaerobes may be caused by short seemingly insignificant exposure to oxygen or failure to use prereduced culture mediarecognizing normal flora see table 15-2 is necessary for correct interpretation preliminary identification is expected in 18 to 24 hours and antibiotic sensitivity is reported in 36 to 48 hours most aerobic and facultative organisms are identified within 5 days identification of anaerobic organisms or mycoplasma spp may require an additional 2 to 3 daysbacterial pathogens commonly isolated from various body systems are listed in table 15-1 the overlap between resident and pathogenic organisms should be noted
staphylococcus intermedius is the major pathogen isolated from the skin of dogs with pyoderma gram-negative organisms are likely to be contaminants in superficial pyoderma and secondary to s intermedius in deep pyodermaprimary bacterial rhinitis is rare in dogs and cats but can result from infection with b bronchiseptica mycoplasma spp and chlamydophila felis cats primary bacterial pneumonia can result from bordetella bronchiseptica or mycoplasma spp whereas other organisms are usually secondary to viral infections or aspirationbacterial growth from urine obtained by cystocentesis is significant because the bladder is normally sterile urine cultures however are best interpreted in conjunction with a urinalysis if growth occurs despite absence of significant pyuria see chapter 7 sample contamination improper sample transport or diseases causing immune suppression eg hyperadrenocorticism diabetes mellitus fiv infection must be considered in quantitative culture of urine obtained by catheterization or midstream voiding greater than or equal to 100000 coloniesml is significant lower concentrations may be significant in chronic infections or in females in samples of prostatic fluid obtained by ejaculation infection is diagnosed if the specimen contains greater than or equal to 100 times more bacteria than the urethral sample ling et al 1983 culture of prostatic aspirates may be more accurateblood cultures can be difficult to interpret false-positive results are caused by contamination with normal cutaneous microflora including corynebacterium spp bacillus spp coagulase-negative staphylococci anaerobic diphtheroids streptococci and clostridium spp isolation of the same organism from two or more cultures strongly suggests that it is pathogenic whereas growth in only one culture is less certain unless it is a pathogenic bacterium unlikely to be a contaminant

sc and deep fungal infections are best diagnosed by cytologic or histopathologic evaluation with or without serology if organisms cannot be identified cutaneous lesions can be cultured but these are rarely useful owing to overgrowth by resident bacteria and fungi the lesion is prepared as for dermatophytes and a swab is cultured onto sabourauds and mycose mediumsystemic and sc fungi may require 2 weeks cultivation on sabourauds medium for growth to occurmost cats with bartonellosis bartonella henselae are subclinically infected however fever uveitis lymphadenopathy gingivitis or stomatitis occur in some cats and are indications for antibody testing because the organism is transmitted between cats by ctenocephalidies felis cats with a history of flea infestation are more likely to be infected the clinical significance of other bartonella spp that infect cats is unknown at this timecirculating antibodies are detected by immunofluorescent antibody assay ifa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and western blot immunoassay see appendix i for availability of testingcats infected by fleas are generally bacteremic by week 2 bacteremia can persist for months chomel et al 1996 antibodies are first detected at approximately week 2 and detectable concentrations persist for months after resolution of bacteremia bacteremia has also been detected in antibody-negative cats b henselae seroprevalence is often greater than 50 in regions with fleas in healthy cats in a birmingham alabama shelter the seroprevalence was 714 lappin et al 2000 because so many healthy cats are seropositive detection of positive antibody test results does not definitively diagnose clinical bartonellosis in a clinically ill cat the clinician must still exclude other causes of the clinical syndrome because antibody test results do not correlate to blood culture results and because treatment of healthy carriers is not recommended lappin et al 2003 screening healthy cats for bartonella antibodies is not indicated detection of local antibody production by the eye has been used to document uveitis as a result of bartonellosis lappin et al 2000definitive diagnosis is based on detection of the organism in blood culture for b henselae is generally performed on a 15 ml whole blood sample collected aseptically and placed into an edta-containing tube organism dna can be amplified from blood or aqueous humor by pcr assay jensen et al 2000 lappin et al 2000 positive blood culture or pcr results are consistent with current infection but do not document clinical illness repeated bacteremia has been detected in experimentally inoculated and naturally infected cats kordick et al 1995 therefore a single negative blood culture or pcr result does not exclude infection see appendix i for availability of bartonella spp blood culture and pcrdogs from endemic areas or with an appropriate travel history with unexplained myocarditis granulomatous lymphadenitis cutaneous vascular

fleas or ticks are most likely to be exposedcirculating antibodies are detected by ifa see appendix i for availability of testingantibodies can be detected in dogs with and without clinical signs seronegative test results make clinical illness caused by b vinsonii less likely seropositive test results suggest that the organism could be involved but the clinician must still exclude other causes of the clinical syndromedefinitive diagnosis is based on detection of the organism in blood but the organism is more difficult to culture than b henselae amplification of the organism dna is usually more successful than culture see appendix i for availability of testing positive blood culture or pcr results are consistent with current infection but do not document clinical illness a single negative blood culture or pcr does not exclude infection by b vinsoniidogs from areas endemic for ixodes ticks or with an appropriate travel history and fever lameness glomerulonephritis dambach et al

antibodies against b burgdorferi can be detected in canine serum titers considered significant vary by laboratory and assay both antibody classes can persist in serum for months after exposure cross-reactivity with b burgdorferi antigens used in ifa and elisa occurs with other spirochetes thus a positive titer does not document exposure to b burgdorferi b burgdorferi vaccines induce antibodies that are detected by ifa and elisa and one of the available point-of-care assays

commercially available for detection of b burgdorferi antibodies against the c6 peptide e canis antibodies and dirofilaria immitis antigen was licensed recently antibodies against the c6 peptide are not induced by vaccination so positive results of this kit denote exposure to b burgdorferi some nonpathogenic strains of b burgdorferi induce antibody production but not clinical disease breitschwerdt 1995 some dogs with acute lyme disease are seronegative on initial testing documentation of an increasing antibody titer can suggest recent exposure antibody titers greater than or equal to 11000 have been detected in clinically normal dogs healthy dogs develop the same antibody responses as clinically ill dogs however because of these factors interpretation of serum antibody titers is difficult serum antibodies against b burgdorferi only documents exposure to b burgdorferi or a similar antigen not clinical disease finding a higher titer in csf than in serum occurs in some dogs with suspected neurologic disease secondary to lyme diseasedefinitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism by culture histopathologic evaluation of tissue or pcr presumptive diagnoses of clinical lyme disease in dogs can be based on appropriate clinical historical and laboratory evidence of disease combined with positive serologic testing and response to therapydogs with reproductive tract abnormalities lymphadenomegaly hyperglobulinemia diskospondylitis or uveitis should be suspected of having brucellosis and screened for antibodies against b caniscirculating antibodies are detected in serum by rapid slide agglutination test rsat tube agglutination test tat agar gel immunodiffusion agid and elisa carmichael and shin 1996the rsat and tat are screening procedures a rsat for point-of-care use is commercially available
both assays should be performed with 2-mercaptoethanol 2-me to eliminate heterologous igm agglutinins responsible for most false-positive reactions false-positive reactions in the 2-me tat may be the result of autoagglutination in hemolyzed samples agid can be performed using cell wall antigens or cytoplasmic antigens agid performed with cytoplasmic antigens is the most specific antibody assay agid performed with cell wall antigens is the most sensitive because of nonspecific precipitin reactions positive results in agid with cell wall antigens are difficult to interpretminimal time between infection and a positive test result varies with the test but most infected dogs are seropositive in the 2-me tat and agid by week 4 after infection2-me tat titers from different laboratories cannot be meaningfully compared however a titer of 150 to 1100 is generally suspicious whereas a titer greater than or equal to 1200 usually correlates with isolation of b canis from blood culture carmichael and shin 1996 after cessation of bacteremia 2-me tat titers rapidly decrease to less than 1200 within a few weeks and remain low 125 to 150 for 6 months or longer in agid antibodies to external antigens persist for a few weeks whereas antibodies to internal ie cytoplasmic antigens persist up to 12 months after cessation of bacteremia although these animals are abacteremic b canis can be isolated from selected organs eg epididymis prostatewhen the 2-me rsat or tat are used as a screening test and results are positive a tentative diagnosis of brucellosis is made positive blood culture or agid should be used to confirm results if blood culture or agid is negative brucellosis is unlikely if 2-me rsat or tat results are negative in a dog strongly suspected of having brucellosis the test should be repeated in 4 weeks to preclude the possibility of early infectiondefinitive diagnosis requires isolation of b canis although this is not always achieved although blood culture is ideal it is inconvenient and expensive culture of urine or an ejaculate may also be performed in males growth usually occurs within 7 days but cultures should be held for 3 to 4 weeks before being discarded at least three cultures from specimens obtained several days apart are recommendedserologic testing for antibodies against leptospira spp should be considered in dogs with undiagnosed fever ecchymoses vomiting diarrhea muscle pain uveitis coughing dyspnea renal pain thrombocytopenia renal failure particularly acute or increased activities of hepatic enzymes the most common pathogenic serovars in dogs include leptospira canicola l icterohaemorrhagiae l grippotyphosa l bratislava and l pomona rentko and ross 1992circulating antibodies are detected in serum by the microscopic agglutination test mat elisa igm igg and microscopic microcapsular agglutination test mcat most diagnostic laboratories use mat bolin 1996 the primary disadvantage of serologic testing is that it is difficult to determine whether positive titers are caused by active infection previous infection or vaccinationantibodies are detected by mat days to weeks after inoculation most laboratories assess multiple serovars in the assay cross-reactivity exists between some serovars the serovar with the highest titer is probably the serovar causing infection acutely infected dogs are often mat negative dogs with suggestive clinical signs of disease but negative mat results should be retested in 2 to 4 weeks development of a positive titer confirms recent infection a fourfold increase in antibody titer over 2 to 4 weeks confirms recent infection vaccination can induce positive mat titersdefinitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism by urine dark-field microscopy phase contrast microscopy or culture examination of urine for leptospires is a low-yield procedure demonstration of spirochetes by histopathologic evaluation of renal tissue leads to a presumptive diagnosis which may be confirmed by tissue culture in acute disease leptospiremia occurs for a few days to 2 weeks after infection during which time the organism may sometimes be cultured from blood urine can be cultured but repeated culture may be needed because of intermittent shedding the combination of increasing antibody titers with appropriate clinical pathologic abnormalities and clinical findings suggests clinical leptospirosis pcr can be used to demonstrate the organism in urine blood or tissues but is not widely available at this time is not standardized between laboratories and is expensivetesting for tularemia ie rabbit fever should be considered in animals from endemic areas developing fever lymphadenomegaly weight loss or oral ulceration particularly if tick exposure rabbit ingestion or potential for human infection is confirmed tularemia is a direct zoonosis from clinically ill cats to peopleclinicians measure antibodies in serum using tat cross-reactivity with brucella abortus and certain strains of proteus vulgaris has been documented with human serum see appendix i for availability of testing time between acquisition of infection and a positive titer is not known a single titer of 180 or higher or a fourfold increase in titer between acute and convalescent sera 3 weeks later is presumptive evidence of infection definitive diagnosis is obtained by isolation of the bacterium in a culture of a blood specimen or by identification in tissue by immunofluorescencedogs and cats with nasal or pulmonary disease can be serologically screened for antibodies against aspergillus fumigatus cats are affected less frequently than dogs results must be interpreted in conjunction with cytology radiology histopathology and cultureagid counterimmunoelectrophoresis ciep and elisa are used to detect circulating antibodies in serum sharp 1998 serum antibodies can represent exposure or infection results in many dogs with nasal aspergillosis are falsely negative owing to persistence of titers in some treated dogs 12 months monitoring titers to assess therapeutic response is not recommendedradiographic demonstration of nasal turbinate destruction suggests aspergillosis or nasal neoplasia cytologic analysis see color plate 3d and culture of canine nasal exudate alone are not diagnostic because fungal elements may be nondetectable in affected dogs although being found in noninfected dogs including dogs with nasal tumors the organism is sometimes difficult to culture from an aspergilloma fungal ball nasal lavage is a low-yield procedure for demonstration of the organism nasal biopsy is suggested see chapter 11 definitive diagnosis should be based on three factors 1 histopathologic evidence of tissue invasion 2 an aspergilloma combined with serologic and culture evidence of infection or 3 serologic and radiographic evidence of infection ie bone lysis in rare cases with disseminated disease cytologic evaluation of aspirates of affected tissue may be useful if the organism cannot be demonstrated by biopsy samples obtained through the nares positive serologic test results may support exploratory surgerydogs from endemic areas with fever weight loss

disease can be serologically screened for antibodies against blastomyces dermatitidis if the organism is not demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture in endemic areas screening for antibodies against b dermatitidis should be considered in cats with pulmonary interstitial disease intracranial disease lymphadenomegaly ulcerative or draining skin lesions or uveitis and blindnesscirculating antibodies are most commonly detected in serum by agid legendre 1998 because subclinical canine infections are unusual positive serologic results are considered significant false-negative results occur in animals with peracute infection or with advanced cases overwhelming the immune system many cats with blastomycosis are seronegative antibody titers do not always revert to negative after successful treatmentdefinitive diagnosis requires identification of the yeast by cytology histopathology or fungal culture impression smears from skin lesions and aspirates from

cannot be demonstrated cytologically or to monitor response to treatment a pcr assay has been used to amplify the organism dna from tissue but has not been assessed extensively to date kano et al 2001animals with weight loss pulmonary interstitial disease uveal disease diarrhea or lymphadenomegaly can be serologically screened for antibodies against h capsulatum if the organism is not demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture wolf 1998primarily agid is used to detect circulating antibodies in serum presence of serum antibodies confirm exposure but not clinical illness because of infection agid has questionable clinical usefulness because titers persist longer than 1 year after resolution of disease in some animals and both false-positive and false-negative results occur antibody testing is even less rewarding in catsdefinitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism by cytology see color plate 3e biopsy or culture the organism is more difficult to demonstrate than b dermatitidis however cytologic examination of rectal scrapings in dogs with colonic histoplasmosis is often diagnostic fine-needle aspiration of other organs may demonstrate the organism in most cats with systemic histoplasmosis the organism is identified on bone marrow cytology thoracic radiographs are indicated if pulmonary histoplasmosis is suspected a nodular interstitial pattern is expected culture of h capsulatum is of lower yield than biopsy serologic diagnosis is unreliable generally not recommended and used only to establish a presumptive diagnosis when the organism cannot be demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture but other abnormalities suggest the diseasebabesia serology is indicated in dogs from endemic areas or in those with an appropriate travel history that have fever anemia icterus splenomegaly ie acute babesiosis or intermittent fever and weight loss ie chronic babesiosis although babesiosis can cause anemia in cats the species infecting cats are not found in the united statescirculating antibodies are detected in serum by ifa see appendix i for availability of testing in most laboratories titers greater than 140 are considered positive breitschwerdt 1995 experimentally infected dogs develop detectable igg titers approximately 3 weeks after infection false-negative results can occur in immature dogs in peracute cases or in dogs with concurrent immunosuppression antibodies against b gibsoni and b canis may or may not cross-react depending on the antigen source used by a particular laboratory some dogs with b gibsoni are seronegative on ifa using b canis antigen ifas are available using b gibsoni antigens dogs suspected of having babesiosis yet seronegative for b canis should be screened for antibodies against b gibsoni antibodies can be detected in dogs that are healthy and those that are clinically ill antibody titer magnitude does not correlate to the presence or absence of disease a titer of greater than 1320 was suggested for b gibsoni but not all infected dogs achieve this titer magnitude birkenheuer et al 1999 it is important to determine which species are involved in a case because response to treatment varies duration of positive titers after resolution of disease is unknown in untreated experimentally infected dogs titers remain high for at least 6 months untreated seropositive dogs should be considered carriers of the infection treatment is indicated only for seropositive clinically ill dogsdefinitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism in blood smears stained with romanowsky-type preparations eg wrights and giemsas organisms are best found in blood particularly in acute disease from a microcapillary system eg ventral surface of ear or toenail note shape of the organism may be distorted in old blood in chronic disease or asymptomatic carriers demonstration of organisms is unreliable and a tentative diagnosis is based on clinical signs and a positive titer dogs with babesiosis are often coombs-positive see chapter 3 pcr is now available commercially and can be used to document organism presence but positive results do not

progressive ascending rigid paralysis dysphagia muscle atrophy and rarely myocardial dysfunction or pneumonia lindsay and dubey 2000circulating antibodies are detected in serum by ifa see appendix i for availability of testing a presumptive diagnosis of neosporosis can be made by combining appropriate clinical signs of disease and positive serology or presence of antibodies in csf with the exclusion of other causes inducing similar clinical syndromes in particular t gondii igg antibody titers greater than or equal to 1200 have been detected in most dogs with clinical neosporosis minimal serologic cross-reactivity exists with t gondii at titers greater than or equal to 150 because the organism is a tissue protozoan seropositivity may correlate with permanent infection circulating antibodies against n caninum only documents infection not clinical diseasedefinitive diagnosis is based on demonstration of the organism in tissues the organism can be differentiated from t gondii

positive antibody titers have been detected for months after apparently successful therapy in some naturally infected dogs bartsch and greene 1996 clinically ill seropositive dogs should be treated a minimum of 28 days and until clinical and laboratory abnormalities have resolved neer et al 2002 whether to treat healthy seropositive dogs is controversial the issues involved in this decision were recently reviewed neer et al 2002the clinician can make a definitive diagnosis of e canis infection by demonstrating morulae ie clusters of the organism in mononuclear cells culture or pcr morulae are rarely found on routine blood smear or bone marrow aspiration cytology unless the dog has been immunosuppressed or the neutrophilic strain e ewingii is present ehrlichia spp can be isolated by tissue culture of heparinized infected canine blood or bone marrow aspiration samples but culture is of limited availability expensive and of low yield ehrlichia spp can be detected in whole blood by pcr mcbride et al 1996 and has potential benefit for use in monitoring treatment see appendix i for availability of testing the consensus statement on ehrlichial disease of small animals from the infectious disease study group of the acvim neer et al 2002 states the followingif pcr is used to monitor treatment the pcr assay should be repeated after antimicrobial therapy has been discontinued for 2 weeks if pcr results are positive an additional 4 weeks of treatment should be given with the pcr assay repeated after antimicrobial therapy has been discontinued for 2 weeks if pcr results are positive after 2 treatment cycles use of an alternate antiehrlichial drug should be considered if pcr results are negative the test should be rechecked in 2 months if still negative therapeutic elimination is likely however the organism may be sequestered in other tissues like the spleenserologic testing for ehrlichiosis is indicated for cats with thrombocytopenia anemia leukopenia hyperglobulinemia proteinuria polyarthritis fever or lymphadenomegaly if no other obvious cause exists bouloy et al 1994 peavy et al 1997 stubbs et al 2000ifa has detected circulating igg antibodies

of clinically ill cats some cats with presumed e canis infection have been seronegative antibodies against e canis e risticii and a phagocytophila can be detected in serum from healthy cats and therefore cannot be used alone to make a definitive diagnosis of ehrlichiosis a tentative diagnosis of feline ehrlichiosis is based on the combination of clinical signs positive serologic test results

igg antibodies against e platys are detected in serum by ifa antibodies against e platys do not react with e canis antigens see appendix i for availability of testing the cutoff for a positive igg antibody titer varies by laboratory experimentally infected dogs become antibody positive 13 to 19 days after infection french and harvey 1983 low antibody titers in suspected clinical cases should be rechecked after 21 days because many dogs are subclinically infected positive antibody titers do not prove clinical disease definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism within platelets difficult owing to cyclic parasitemiaserologic testing for rmsf is indicated for dogs from endemic areas or with an appropriate travel history and acute onset of fever lymphadenomegaly petechiae neurologic signs stiff gait peripheral edema dyspnea or scleral congestion history of tick exposure is inconsistent exposed dogs either develop acute disease with approximately a 14-day clinical course or are subclinically infected the primary tick vectors are active from spring to fall in most of the united states therefore rmsf should only be considered a principal differential diagnosis for clinically ill dogs during this time span the majority of cases are diagnosed in southeastern statesthe clinician can measure antibodies against r rickettsii in canine serum by ifa elisa and la greene et al 1993 elisa or ifa can detect igm and igg antibodies against rmsf la is not antibody class-specific cutoffs for positive antibody titers as well as specificity and sensitivity vary by assay greene et al 1993 after experimental inoculation igm antibodies can be detected by ifa by day 9 peak by day 20 and are negative by day 80 breitschwerdt 1995 in dogs with clinical illness because of rmsf igm antibody titers are generally positive because igm has short duration in serum false-negative results may occur with igm testing false-positive results are most common in the igm elisa positive igg titers are detectable 20 to 25 days after infection serum samples with igg titers greater than or equal to 164 are generally considered positive if igg or igm antibodies are not detected in a patient with clinical and laboratory evidence of rmsf a convalescent igg titer 2 to 3 weeks later is recommended timing of the second titer is not critical because igg antibody titers do not decrease for at least 3 to 5 months after infection documentation of seroconversion or a fourfold increase in igg titer is consistent with recent infectiona presumptive diagnosis of canine rmsf can be based on the combination of appropriate clinical historical and clinicopathologic evidence of disease serologic test results exclusion of other causes of the clinical abnormalities and response to anti-rickettsial drugs documentation of seroconversion or an increasing titer 2 to 3 weeks after initial serologic testing suggests recent infection diagnostic criteria used in one recent study included a four-fold rise in antibody titer or a single titer of greater than or equal to 11024 if the initial titer was submitted 1 week or more after initial onset of clinical abnormalities gasser birkenheuer and breitschwerdt 2001 positive serum antibody test results alone do not prove rmsf because subclinical infection is common in addition positive serum antibody tests do not document infection by r rickettsii because infection with nonpathogenic spotted fever group agents induce cross-reacting antibodiesdemonstration of r rickettsii by inoculating affected tissues or blood into susceptible laboratory animals or by documenting the organism in endothelial cells using direct fluorescent antibody staining leads to a definitive diagnosis of rmsf but are not clinically practical pcr can be used to document the presence of rickettsial agents in blood other fluids or tissues and will likely be clinically useful in the futuredogs with appropriate signs of cns disease can have antibodies in csf and serum against canine distemper virusthe clinician can measure csf and serum igg antibodies against canine distemper virus by serum virus neutralization ifa or elisa elisa can be used to measure serum igm antibodies csf antibodies to distemper virus are increased in some dogs subsequently diagnosed histopathologically as having distemper encephalitis false-positive results can occur in csf samples contaminated with blood concurrent measurement of serum antibody concentrations can be helpful if csf concentrations are greater than serum concentrations the antibody in csf had to be produced locally and suggests cns distemper detection of serum igg antibodies is of minimal diagnostic value because a positive titer could develop secondary to vaccination or previous exposure a fourfold increase in serum igg titer over a 3- to 4-week period suggests recent infection detection of circulating igm antibodies is consistent with recent infection but not clinical disease a point-of-care assay for detection of canine distemper antibodies is available
vaccinated dogs seropositive in this assay probably do not need to be boosted a presumptive diagnosis of distemper encephalitis can be made with increased csf protein and leukocytes lymphocytes predominating plus a positive csf antibody titer in a sample not contaminated with peripheral blood definitive diagnosis of canine distemper infection requires demonstration of viral inclusions by cytologic examination see color plates 2d and 2e direct fluorescent antibody staining of cytologic or histopathologic specimens histopathologic evaluation or pcr documentation of distemper viral dna in peripheral blood csf or conjunctival scrapings see appendix i for availability of pcr testing viral inclusions can rarely be found in erythrocytes leukocytes and leukocyte precursors of infected dogs inclusions are generally present for only 2 to 9 days after infection and therefore often are not present when clinical signs occur inclusions may be easier to find in smears made from buffy coats or bone marrow aspirates than those made from peripheral blood viral particles can be detected by immunofluorescence in cells from the tonsils respiratory tree urinary tract conjunctival scrapings and csf for 5 to 21 days after infectionviral enteritis induced by parvoviruses coronaviruses and other viruses should be suspected in young animals with fever and diarrhea particularly if neutropenia is present ie parvovirusesdetermining serum antibodies to feline parvovirus and canine parvovirus or coronavirus is rarely performed clinically because positive results do not correlate with clinical disease a point-of-care assay for detection of canine parvovirus antibodies is available

antibody titers to felv envelope antigens neutralizing antibody and against virus-transformed tumor cells feline oncogenic cell membrane antigen or focma antibody are available in some laboratories but the prognostic significance of the results is currently unknown therefore the tests are not recommendedfelv infection has six stages zenger and wolf 1992 stages 1 through 3 are dissemination stages bone marrow infection occurs in stage 4 infected neutrophils and platelets are released from the bone marrow in stage 5 and virus appears in systemic epithelial tissues including salivary glands and tear glands during stage 6 elisa can detect p27 antigen in serum during stages 2 through 6 p27 in cells is not detected by the ifa until stages 5 and 6 thus serum elisa is the first assay to become positive after infection positive results occurring 2 to 30 weeks generally 2 to 8 weeks after infectionseropositivity can be detected by serum elisa before a cat develops persistent ie stages 4 to 6 infection thus some cats yield negative results after development of neutralizing antibodies in healthy cats seropositive results by serum elisa should be confirmed by ifa or retesting by elisa in 4 to 6 weeks some elisa-positive cats reverting to negative status have become latently infected the majority of latently infected cats are elisa-negative on all testing but virus can be isolated from bone marrow virus can also be localized to other tissues false-positive elisa results can be the result of poor laboratory techniquea positive ifa test result has 99 correlation with virus isolation false-negative reactions may occur when leukopenia or thrombocytopenia prevents evaluation of an adequate number of cells false-positive reactions rarely occur from nonspecific staining of eosinophils a positive ifa indicates that the cat is viremic and contagious the viremia may be transient or sustained unless the ifa test is performed during a transient infection the animal will likely  95 remain positive for lifevirtually all ifa-positive cats are elisa-positive finding an ifa-positive but elisa-negative cat suggests technique-related artifact a negative elisa result is approximately 100 correlated with negative ifa and an inability to isolate felv cats that are elisa-positive but ifa-negative are called discordant discordant results are usually caused by false-positive elisa results false-negative ifa results or transient stage 2 to 3 infection the american association of feline practitioners has summarized testing recommendations for felv or fiv infections httpwwwaafponlineorgaboutguidelinesretrovirustesting2001pdfsome cats with latent infection localized to bone marrow have positive bone marrow ifa results the most reliable means of identifying latent felv infections is virus isolation or pcr performed on bone marrow cells but neither technique is widely available a latently infected cat may become viremic ie ifa- and

intestinal parasites d reconditum hemolysis and concurrent use of diethylcarbamazine ivermectin or milbemycin do not alter results of antigen assays in dogs d immitis antigen tests may be positive as early as 5 to 6 months and are usually positive 6 to 7 months after infection false-negative results usually occur in early stages of infection and may occur in single-sex infections male only or in animals with low worm burdens  3 to 5 worms retesting in 2 to 3 months should be performed to detect dogs in which results were negative in early stages of infection after successful adulticide treatment test results become negative in approximately 12 weeks in experimental infections cats testing positive did so about 8 months after infection however single sex or low worm burden infections can lead to false-negative results therefore a positive antigen test result is specific for infection but a negative result does not rule out dirofilariasis in cats the combination of serum antigen test results with serum antibody test results is more sensitive than performing either test alone synder et al 2000definitive diagnosis requires detecting circulating microfilariae characteristic radiographic signs ie right-sided cardiac enlargement increased diameter with or without tortuosity of pulmonary arteries pulmonary interstitial infiltrate or circulating heartworm antigen amicrofilaremic dogs with clinical signs of disease should be evaluated for serum antigen and with thoracic radiographs in a previously infected and treated dog it may be impossible to differentiate new from old radiographic lesions in such cases serum antigen testing is indicatedcoughing unexplained vomiting syncope or radiographic evidence of heartworm diseaseseveral elisas detect antibodies to d immitis in feline sera




the assays are more sensitive than microfilaria demonstration techniques the assays are very specific no cross-reactivity exists with d reconditum the positive predictive value for heartworm disease is less than 100 however because circulating antibodies can be present in cats that have cleared the infection naturally false-negative antibody test results also occur therefore serum antibody and antigen tests should be performed in concert in cats with suspected dirofilariasis synder et al 2000we read with interest the editorial regarding the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 serologic tests as a screening tool in populations with low prevalence1 we agree that use of antibody tests for the novel coronavirus have the potential to be useful for clinical and population health applications this is particularly true when the prevalence of antibodies in the tested population is at least 10 or greater as the authors show lower prevalence results in suboptimal positive predictive values even for serologic tests that have 99 specificityof concern to us is how the authors chose to represent the clinical sensitivity of the 10 serologic tests that had been granted emergency use authorization not approval by the food and drug administration fda as of april 30 2020 the sensitivities shown in table 1 of their article are acknowledged as being derived from information on the fda website however rather than reporting sensitivity positive percent agreement relative to the day of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 symptom onset or diagnosis the authors chose to calculate sensitivity using the total of all specimens tested without regard to the timing of sample collection personal communication from authors in our opinion reporting sensitivity in this way is misleading as it understates the optimal sensitivity defined as the ability of a test to detect sars-cov-2 antibodies when they are present no test is able to detect antibodies that are not present because they have not yet been produced or are at a concentration that is well below analytical sensitivity as will happen in very early infection the authors justified their calculation of sensitivity by stating that the tested population may not always be several days to weeks away from diagnosis while this is true the same could be said for any serologic test that is used as a screening test as an example the sensitivities of hiv antibody tests are calculated from individuals known to contain antibodies or from seroconversion panels it is well known that tests for infectious disease antibodies will have lower sensitivities if used in very recently infected patients the same is true for the novel coronavirus calculating and reporting antibody test sensitivity without regard to onset of infection is a practice to be avoidedwe would like to stress that our editorial intends to point out limitations of using antibody serologic tests as a screening tool mainly due to the low prevalence of covid-19 in most parts of the united states and not specifically due to the limitations of test performance sensitivity and specificity of any individual test in the market test performance mainly specificity does contribute to low positive predictive value ppv of antibody tests however low prevalence is the main contributing factor as shown in table 2 of the editorial we understand the concerns regarding presenting clinical sensitivity of the serologic tests as an average in table 1 of the editorial instead of separating it by the timing of collection we decided to present test performance data as an average of all specimens tested for the following reasons 1 there is no uniformity in the data submitted to the fda by test manufactures 2 the table would have been too lengthy if we had split out sensitivity and specificity for each cohort tested for each manufacturer and 3 clinically the patients most likely will be tested irrespective of days post infection or start of the symptoms to our knowledge the manufacturers that have been granted emergency use authorization by the fda do not specify in their instructions for use that the tests are intended to be used for patients only after certain days post infection or start of symptomspcr is accepted as a rapid diagnostic test few of the currently available naats have been extensively validated against culture the sensitivity of naats is almost always superior to that of traditional procedures and they are more and more considered as the new gold standardan increasing body of literature describing the use of in-house naats for detection of m pneumoniae dna or rna in various diseases is available with a great variation of methods used from study to study including variability of target p1 adhesin gene 16s rrna atpase gene protease gene cards toxin gene naat conventional nested real-time monoplex vs multiplex pcr vs isothermal amplification technologies detection formats and different platforms an overview of the literature on the use of naats to detect m pneumoniae since 1989 is given in two reviews loens et al 2003 2010alately efforts have been mainly emphasized on the development of multiplex assays nummi et al 2015 shen et al 2015 and on the evaluation of commercially available assays respiratory viruses and other so called atypical bacteria are all responsible for rtis that may produce clinically similar manifestations in order to reduce costs and hands-on-time multiplex naats for the simultaneous detection of 2 3 or up to more than 20 different respiratory pathogens in one tube with a mixture of primers have been developed by some groups however comparison between mono-and multiplex assays has been rarely performed findings and conclusions result frequently in contradictory and conflicting data concerning the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex naats compared to the mono naats this is not unexpected since the presence of several pairs of primers may increase the probability of mispairing resulting in non-specific amplification products and the formation of primer-dimers furthermore enzymes primers and salt concentrations as well as temperature cyclings required for each target may be slightly different the results of the proficiency panels loens et al 2010b 2012 described previously seem to confirm that multiplex assays are somewhat less sensitive than monoplex assays but until the number of organisms present in clinical specimens of diseased individuals is known it is impossible to state whether the degree of sensitivity attained is clinically acceptablesince the previous review ieven and loens 2013 new naats became commercially available such as the illumigene meridian bioscience usa kit it has been proposed that industry-produced assays in kit form result in better standardization the analytical sensitivity of the illumigene assay was evaluated by using 36 frozen stock cultures of m pneumoniae reference strains and a collection of other microorganisms and human dna ratliff et al 2014 serial dilutions of cultures with a known cfuml defined the analytical sensitivity at 88 cfuml based on the results obtained with 214 archived respiratory specimens previously cultured for m pneumoniae the clinical sensitivity and specificity were found to be 100 and 99 respectively after resolving discrepancies by pcr and sequencinga second example of a test approved for the detection of a number of respiratory viruses by the us food and drug administration is the filmarray respiratory panel biomrieux france the filmarray is a small desktop closed single-piece flow real-time pcr system it includes automation of nucleic acid extraction an initial reverse transcription and multiplex pcr followed by singleplex second stage pcr reactions for the detection of 15 viral agents including adenovirus coronavirus hku1 coronavirus nl63 human metapneumovirus rhinovirusenterovirus

respiratory panel with the addition of b pertussis m pneumonia and c pneumoniae the expanded panel detects now a total of 17 viruses and three bacteria the test requires 5 min hands-on-time and 65 min instrumentation time in 2013 a new version of the filmarray version 17 was released doern et al 2013the argene respiratory mwsr-gene concept allows the detection of numerous pathogens influenza ab

positive clinical specimens were confirmed by the diagenode test the ingenetix and lightmix assay and the geneproof assay respectivelyan overview of commercially available naats for the detection of m pneumoniae is presented in table 1since the calculation of the sensitivities of the commercial multiplex assays was mainly dependent on dna copy number further evaluation and standardization using an extended number of clinical specimens that may have a low bacterial load are needed the use of an international standard developed by the who for harmonization of mycoplasma naat nbling et al 2015 or the yearly participation in the external quality assessment eqa panel for m pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae available from quality control for molecular diagnostics qcmd united kingdom should be consideredso far it is unclear whether asymptomatic carriage of m pneumoniae in adults and children exists and if colonization could be differentiated from infection by the current diagnostic methods there are only few data on the relation between the bacterial load and the severity of infection 405 asymptomatic children and 321 children with a rti were enrolled in a cross-sectional study spuesens et al 2013 nasopharyngeal washings and pharyngeal swabs were investigated by culture and quantitative real-time pcr qpcr serum was collected for igm and igg elisa neither qpcr serology nor culture was capable of differentiating colonization from infection in 212 and 162 of the asymptomatic and symptomatic children m pneumoniae dna was detected in addition persistence of m pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract was shown for up to 4 months by longitudinal sampling a retrospective study investigated the clinical significance of the m pneumoniae bacterial load in children with a m pneumoniae pneumonia jiang et al 2014 the authors concluded that a high bacterial load was indicative for a m pneumoniae infection whereas for a low bacterial load the etiologic role of m pneumoniae remains to be determinededin et al developed a qpcr with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria including m pneumoniae and six viruses edin et al 2015 clinical specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract were used to compare the qpcr assay with standard microbiological methods the use of the qpcr assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics the authors conclude that in parallel qpcr detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible since a good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens was obtainedin contrast to the above mentioned studies jain et al 2015 examined specimens from 2222 hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia and 521 asymptomatic controls for the detection of a variety of respiratory pathogens m pneumoniae was detected in 8 and in 3 or less of controlsanother trend is the simultaneous detection of m pneumoniae and mutations associated with macrolide resistance directly in clinical specimens ji et al 2014 liu et al 2014 nummi et al 2015 zhao et al 2015serological methods in particular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa are most widely used to diagnose a m pneumoniae infection the complement fixation test cft has been replaced by assays which allow for quantification of igm iga or igg however the most convincing evidence of an ongoing infection is a significant increase in igg or an igg seroconversion in paired sera collected 34 weeks apart nir-paz et al 2006 although igm antibodies appear earlier than igg antibodies and are thus an attractive alternative for diagnosis of a m pneumoniae infection one should realize that igm is not often produced in very young children in a proportion of primary infections and during re-infections waites et al 2008 loens et al 2010aten serological assays for the diagnosis of a m pneumoniae infection were recently evaluated by using 145 sera from 120 patients busson et al 2013 seromp igm and igg savyon diagnostics seromp recombinant igm iga and igg savyon diagnostics liaison m pneumoniae igm and igg biotrin international ltd m pneumoniae igm iga and igg medac medac gmbh a low igm specificity and cross-reactivity was noticed for the seromp recombinant and liaison assay for iga the medac assay tended to be less specific than the seromp recombinant assay all four tests showed discrepancies in the igg measurements confirming results of previous studies talkington et al 2004 beersma et al 2005 in conclusion serology remains a diagnostic tool of choice but improvement and standardization of the assays are still needed especially for the determination of iggthe clinical significance of a serologic test both for igm and igg should be defined by studies of patients with a documented infection and for whom detailed information concerning the time lapses between onset of disease and the collection of the serum specimens are knowna promising blotting technique improving the performance of the m pneumoniae serological assays has been described dumke et al 2012data from recent studies using pcr based methods and serology published during the last decade in different patient populations from around the world are summarized in the recent reviews published by ieven and loens loens et al 2010a ieven and loens 2013 and updated in table 2the availability of the very sensitive naats has in recent years also put the often used serological tests in their right perspective and allow a better interpretation of the serological test results and their limitations such as the low sensitivity of igm antibodies in acute phase specimens and importance of the delay between two serum samples studies in which also naats are used on respiratory specimens should allow a better interpretation of the serological test resultsa rapid response report from the canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health 2015 presents the results of a literature search in order to identify the diagnostic test accuracy clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of serum igm and molecular tests for the detection of m pneumoniae in patients with a respiratory infection1 six relevant studies were identified but no evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of a serum igm test compared with molecular tests was identified zhang et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnosis of m pneumoniae by pcr and serology zhang et al 2011 and reported a significant heterogeneity between the studies and inconsistent results as welltwo studies compared the application of real-time pcr and serology in children with pneumonia in 2011 54290 children were found to be positive by pcr chang et al 2014 44182 were m pneumoniae igm positive 126 of patients were found to be m pneumoniae positive by both tests at the same time using pcr as gold standard a sensitivity and specificity of resp 622 and 855 were obtained the specificity could be increased to 903 by increasing the cut-off without changing the sensitivity of the igm assay a study conducted by medjo et al 2014 applied pcr culture igm and igg in paired sera for the detection of a m pneumoniae infection in 166 children using igg serology as gold standard the sensitivity of igm pcr and culture was found to be equal 818 specificity was found to be 100 986 and 100 respectively it was concluded that during the acute phase of disease detection of igm antibodies in combination with pcr allowed for a precise and reliable m pneumoniae diagnosis a prospective study in children with community-acquired cap kakuya et al 2014 compared loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp culture and serology at first visit patients were defined positive if positive by culture andor sero-conversion or a four-fold increase in igg in paired sera 31191 patients met the criteria thirteen were positive by culture and serology 17 on culture only and one by serology only a positive lamp result was obtained for all patients that were culture positive the sensitivity and specificity for lamp eia and the particle agglutination test were 968 387 194 and 100 769 and 931 respectivelywhen establishing the etiology in 267 adult cap-patients in norway 10 were found to be m pneumoniae positive two by serology seven and one by pcr applied to a nasopharyngeal flocked swab and an oropharyngeal flocked swab respectively holter et al 2015newer technologies such as microfluidics and the application of nanotechnology offer the potential to an even more rapid detection of important pathogens allowing even near-patient testing since these technologies as naats do not require viable organisms and thus avoid any adverse effect of longer specimen transport they can be successfully applied to both the in- and outpatient settings several companies currently possess the technical expertise and research infrastructure to bring a useful diagnostic testing approach to the clinical trial stage shortlyli et al 2015 developed a colloidal gold-based immune-chromatographic assay by using a pair of monoclonal antibodies targeting a region of the p1 gene when applied to 303 clinical specimens from children suspected with a m pneumoniae infection the sensitivity and specificity against real-time pcr were 100 and 974 this is in contrast to the results obtained with a commercially available rapid antigen test targeting the ribosomal protein l7l12 ribotest mycoplasma compared to real-time pcr a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 625 and 909 were obtained when applied to clinical specimens miyashita et al 2015 based on these results the authors concluded that treatment decisions should not be taken based on the ribotest results aloneother amplification-free detection methodologies are currently being developed as biosensing detection strategies a proto-type of an enzyme-free electrochemical genosensor on nanostructured screen-printed gold electrodes garcia-gonzalez et al 2015 a silver nanorod array-surface enhanced raman spectroscopy biosensing platform was successfully applied for the detection of m pneumoniae in simulated and clinical throat swabs henderson et al 2014 2015with the use of tools such as naats a greater understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of m pneumoniae is possible taken into account the results obtained in recent studies there is more evidence that real-time naats are superior to other m pneumoniae detection strategies during the early phase of infection naats however cannot completely replace serology in epidemiological studies serology is certainly more useful than for the management of individual patients with lrti or even cap since results are often delayed by the need for paired sera to detect a seroconversion or a significant rise in titer early in the course of an infection false-negative results often occurin case a specific igm test is used serology should not completely be abolished despite the fact that igm serology shows a moderate sensitivity nowadays a combination of the detection of igm antibodies and pcr may be the most optimal approach for early diagnosis of a m pneumoniae infection especially in childrenthe implementation of quantitative tests could shed further light on the relation between bacterial load and the seriousness of the disease produce useful prognostic information and help in the differentiation between colonization and infection more information could be gathered on the length of the post infection carrier state as well as on the importance of subclinical infections and how prone these are for spreading infectionit remains important to recognize the urgent need for the adoption of a more unified and consistent diagnostic approach for current and future investigations therefore a common set of recommendations should be developedthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestcovid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 virus is a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates from 14 of confirmed cases1 the current case definition for confirmed sars-cov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive pharyngeal or respiratory specimens with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk however this case definition likely underestimates true prevalence as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested and testing by pcr of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens is only around 6080 sensitive depending on sampling location and technique and the patients viral load2 widespread testing within the united states is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories therefore the true prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection is likely much higher than currently reported case numbers would indicateserology can play an important role in defining the true prevalence of covid-19 particularly for subclinical infection2 early studies of serology demonstrate high sensitivity to detect confirmed sars-cov-2 infection with antibodies to virus detected approximately 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset3 unlike pcr positivity sars-cov-2 antibodies are detectable throughout the disease course and persist indefinitely4 multiple serologic tests have been developed for covid-195 including a recently fda-approved lateral flow assay however these tests are limited to detection of antibodies against one or two antigens and cross-reactivity with antibodies to other human coronaviruses that are present in all adults6 is currently unknown prior use of serology for detection of emerging coronaviruses focused on antibodies against the spike s protein particularly the s1 domain and the nucleocapsid n protein7 however the optimal set of antigens to detect strain-specific coronavirus antibodies remains unknownprotein microarray technology can be used to detect antibodies of multiple isotypes against hundreds of antigens in a high throughput manner89 so is well suited to serologic surveillance studies this technology which has previously been applied to other emerging coronaviruses10 is based on detection of binding antibodies which are well-correlated with neutralizing antibodies11 but do not require viral culture in biosafety level 3 facilities recently our group developed a coronavirus antigen microarray covam that includes antigens from sars-cov-2 and tested it on human sera collected prior to the pandemic to demonstrate low cross-reactivity with antibodies from human coronaviruses that cause the common cold particularly for the s1 domain2 here we further validate this methodology using convalescent blood specimens from covid-19 cases confirmed by positive sars-cov-2 pcrthe sars-cov-2 convalescent blood specimens from nasopharyngeal sars-cov-2 pcr-positive individuals were collected from different sources to increase the number of positive specimens available for analysis two sera and plasma samples were obtained from acute covid-19 patients from the oregon health sciences university hospital ohsu portland or these were sourced from discarded clinical laboratory specimens exempted from informed consent and irb approval under condition of patient anonymity four plasma samples were obtained from outpatients of the university hospital basel university of basel basel switzerland these patients were screened in accordance with swiss regulations on blood donation and approved as plasma donors according to the blood transfusion service of the swiss red cross with informed consent these donors were diagnosed with covid-19 based on sars-cov-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab pcr tests at time of plasma donation each had two negative nasopharyngeal swab sars-cov-2 pcr- tests and negative sars-cov-2 pcr tests in blood and they were qualified as plasma donors plasma was collected from these convalescent donors at the regional blood transfusion service of the swiss red cross in accordance with national regulations one convalescent plasma was isolated from a large-volume apheresis collection following standard protocol from a documented recovered covid-19 blood donor who was more than 28 days post symptomaticthe negative control sera used in this study were collected between november 2018 and may 2019 for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in the eastern united states were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection ari cases using questionnaires and rt-qpcr so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections built environment and immunologic phenotypes12 a total of 144 de-identified blood specimens were tested on the cov antigen microarray electronic informed consents including future research use authorization was obtained under protocols approved by the institutional review boards irbs of the university of maryland and the department of navy human research protections officethe coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or hek-293 cells table 1 these antigens were provided by sino inc wayne pa as either catalog products or custome synthesis service products the antigens were printed onto microarrays probed with human sera and analyzed as previously described91314briefly lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 01 mgml in phosphate-buffered saline pbs with 0001 tween-20 t-pbs and then printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides from grace bio labs gbl bend or using an omnigrid 100 microarray printer genemachines the microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1100 in 1x gvs fast blocking buffer fischer scientific overnight at 4c washed with t-tbs buffer 20 mm tris-hcl 150 mm nacl 005 tween-20 in ddh2o adjusted to ph 75 and filtered 3 times for 5 minutes each labeled with secondary antibodies to human iga and igg conjugated to quantum dot fluorophores for 2 hours at room temperature and then washed with t-tbs 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried the slides were imaged using arraycam imager grace bio labs bend or to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysisthe mean fluorescence intensity mfi of each antigen was determined by the average of the median fluorescence signal of four replicate spots the fluorescence signal for each spot was determined by its signal intensity subtracted by the background fluorescence antigens containing a human fc tag were removed from the analysis as the secondary antibodies used for quantification are known to bind to human fc non-human fc tag did not interfere with the assay all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 363 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austriamfi was normalized using the normalizequantilesusetarget function from the proprocesscore package version 1480 as a target for normalization a vector containing the median mfi for igg or iga was constructed descriptive statistics were used to summarize the iga and igg reactivity measured as mfi wilcoxon rank sum tests with p  005 corrected for multiple comparisons were used to compare the mean differences between groupsreceiver operating characteristic area under the curve roc auc values for each antigen were calculated by comparing positive and negative specimens using the proc package version 1162 antigens were ranked based on their roc auc values and high performing antigens with roc auc  095 were identified data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package version 330the coronavirus antigen microarray was used to detect igg and iga antibodies against a panel of antigens including coronavirus spike protein s as separated receptor-binding rbd s1 and s2 domains or whole protein s1s2 and nucleocapsid protein np from multiple coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and the four common cold coronaviruses hku1 oc43 nl63 229e as listed in table 1 to determine the antibody profile of sars-cov-2 infection the differential reactivity to these antigens was evaluated for sars-cov-2 convalescent plasma from pcr-positive individuals positive group and sera collected prior to the covid-19 pandemic from nave individuals negative group as shown in figure 1the positive group demonstrates high igg reactivity to sars-cov-2 np s2 and s1s2 antigens and moderate igg reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1 and rbd antigens while the negative group demonstrates low igg cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1s2 and no cross-reactivity to other sars-cov-2 antigens figure 2 the positive group also demonstrates high igg cross-reactivity with sars-cov np and mers-cov s2 and s1s2 antigens while the negative group demonstrates low cross-reactivity with mers-cov s1s2 and no cross-reactivity with other sars-cov and mers-cov antigens the two groups do not differ significantly in reactivity to common cold coronaviruses and other seasonally circulating respiratory virusessimilar trends are observed for iga but with lower reactivity overall figure 3 the positive group again demonstrates high iga reactivity to sars-cov-2 np s2 and s1s2 and moderate iga reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1 with high iga cross-reactivity to sars-cov np while the negative group demonstrates low iga cross-reactivity to all sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov antigenseach coronavirus antigen was evaluated for performance in discriminating the positive group from the negative group across a full range of assay cutoff values to generate receiver operating characteristic roc curves for which area under curve roc auc was measured figure 4 high-performing antigens for detection of igg or iga defined by roc auc  095 included all sars-cov-2 antigens and mers-cov s2 for igg and sars-cov-2 s2 and s1s2 for iga table 2 each of these antigens discriminated between the positive group and the negative group with high significance figure 5this study reveals several insights into the antibody response to sars-cov-2 infection the antibody profiles of nave individuals include high igg reactivity to common cold coronaviruses with low-level cross-reactivity with s2 domains from sars-cov-2 and other epidemic coronaviruses which is not surprising given the high degree of sequence homology and previously observed serologic cross-reactivity15 between s2 domains of betacoronaviruses a group that includes sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers and common cold coronaviruses hku1 and oc43 however nave individuals do not show cross-reactivity to other sars-cov-2 antigens even for the nucleocapsid protein which also has high sequence homology between betacoronaviruses cross-reactivity is only seen between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov and not with mers-cov or common cold coronaviruses in addition the quantitative difference between high antibody reactivity to sars-cov-2 s2 in the positive group and low-level antibody cross-reactivity in the negative group is large enough that these antigens still discriminate these groups with high significancethis study also informs antigen selection and design for population surveillance and clinical diagnostic assays and vaccine development the observation that nave individuals with antibodies to common cold coronaviruses do not show cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein dispels concerns that the high sequence homology of this protein across betacoronaviruses would impair its performance as a diagnostic or vaccine antigen the low-level antibody cross-reactivity of nave individuals for sarscov-2 spike protein containing s2 domain may not preclude its use as a diagnostic antigen given large quantitative difference in antibody reactivity between positive and negative groups but this cross-reactivity may influence response to vaccination with spike protein antigens containing the s2 domainthe coronavirus antigen microarray can be useful both as an epidemiologic tool and as a research tool the high throughput detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibody profiles that reliably distinguish covid-19 cases from negative controls can be applied to large-scale population surveillance studies for a more accurate estimation of the true prevalence of disease than can be achieved with symptom-based pcr testing in addition detection of these antibodies in sars-cov-2 convalescent plasma donations can provide validation prior to clinical use for passive immunization the variation in the sars-cov-2 antibody profiles among acute and convalescent donors suggests that epitope characterization of convalescent donor plasma will be informative for evaluation of passive immune therapy efficacy in covid-19 patients the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe covid-1916 can be more closely studied by analyzing both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibody responses particularly to test hypotheses regarding antibody-dependent enhancement with critical implications for vaccine development17a coronavirus antigen microarray containing a panel of antigens from sars-cov-2 in addition to other human coronaviruses was able to reliably distinguish convalescent plasma of pcr-positive covid-19 cases from negative control sera collected prior to the pandemic by detecting both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibodies further studies are needed to apply this methodology to large-scale serologic surveillance studies and to correlate specific antibody responses with clinical outcomesdatabases including pubmed medrxiv and biorxiv were searched for published and preprint papers on covid-19 and

characteristics of the clinical disease of confirmed sars-cov-2 patients were also recorded when available lastly calculated test accuracy and information regarding comparison to other immunoassays and rt-pcr testing was noted two independent reviewers from the department of pathology and laboratory medicine and department of hematology at the university of miami and jackson health system extracted the informationthe variable sensitivity and specificity of lfia have been the focus of the media and numerous studies due to the growing number of commercially available devices617 several investigations reported high sensitivity and specificity of these assays although many lacked information regarding the target antigens and well-defined negative control groups ie human coronavirus controls table 1 summarizes the review of studies using lfia methods6718-29the experimental design and data of 7 studies were judged to provide insight into lfia method applications li et al7 evaluated a combined igmigg lfia using the rbd antigen in a sample set obtained from 397 positive patients defined by positive rt-pcr and covid-19 symptoms and 128 negative patients the assay sensitivity was 89 and the specificity was 91 notably 64 of the samples from the positive patient group demonstrated both igm and igg reactivity lou et al22 reported the use of 3 different lfia igm and total antibody using rbd antigen and igg detection using np antigen using a large group of covid-19negative patient samples n  209 but not a control group of samples from patients with other viral infections or diseases an excellent specificity ranging from 95 to 100 was reported for all 3 devices notably the sensitivity of the total antibody lfia had the highest performance at 98 also the performance of all the assays compared well with similarly constructed and validated elisa in the same study using 147 control samples from patients with various viral infections and 93 samples from covid-19 patients geurtsvankessel et al26 reviewed 3 lfia including the cellex this device uses a combination of sp and np antigens the sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 87 and 81 for igm detection and 84 and 85 for igg detection respectively interestingly the orient lfia also constructed with the same 2 antigens showed a sensitivity of 89 for igm detection and 92 for igg detection the assay specificity for each isotype was 100 but it should be noted that the latter study tested a very small sample set of negative controls another study utilized samples from both negative patients and patients with other viral infections and examined 6 lfia devices18 although no target antigen information was presented the patient sample sets were robust while evaluation of 2 of the lfia demonstrated a poor performance the remaining devices demonstrated 83 to 93 sensitivity and 100 specificity values lastly traugott et al28 presented data regarding 2 lfia with specificity ranging from 98 100 but sensitivity was reported as poor at less than 5 days post onset of symptoms 13-20 poor to moderate at days 6 to 10 20-80 and excellent at or after day 11 100one study examined the accuracy of 10 different lfia and 2 elisa immunoassays using samples obtained from covid-19 patients at different time points of disease6 specificity was assessed using 108 samples from healthy subjects and 52 samples from patients with other respiratory illnesses not specified the highest detection rate observed using lfia devices was obtained with combined igm and igg detection accuracy peaked at days 16 to 20 post onset of symptoms with sensitivity results greater than 80 and specificity results greater than 95 notably this study reported several false-positive results obtained from banked specimens collected before the pandemic these false-positive results suggest nonspecific binding by plasma proteins or cross-reactivity with antibodies produced during other viral infections in a separate study of 7 lfia devices van elslande et al29 also used a secondary set of 103 control samples to assess assay performance and reported a range of 97 to 100 specificity with the combination of positive igm and igg results but an 85 to 98 range of specificity when only igm or igg positive results were used in their study sensitivity was also reported to vary with the timing of sample acquisition post onset of symptomslfia is an appealing platform for sars-cov-2 testing with a relatively low cost per test and the advantage of potential use for point-of-care testing30 lfia described in the literature thus far provided results for both igm and igg the majority of the reports demonstrated a higher sensitivity and specificity with the detection of both isotypes and a higher specificity was observed with the detection of the igg isotype over the detection of the igm isotype alone antigens frequently used in lfia include np rbd and combined use of np and sp a superior test accuracy based on the use of specific target antigens was not evident at this time studies utilizing samples obtained at various time points demonstrated the accuracy of lfia was optimal at approximately 2 weeks post onset of symptoms overall the understanding of the limitations or advantages for the implementation of lfia-based assays is severely impacted by the presence of only a few properly designed studies in the current literature table 1publications that described elisa method validation often sought to address which antigens and antibody isotypes provided the best sensitivity and specificity table 2618192226-2831-40 in many of these studies these calculations were reported solely to compare the performance of different antigens or the detection of different isotypes and not necessarily to propose the use of the assay for clinical implementation additionally as noted in table 2 many investigations utilized the elisa method to study the timeline of antibody expression in sars-cov-2 patientsto date few investigations have focused on immunoassays utilizing the full sp antigen3134 the sp antigen includes the rbd antigen as well as other essential peptides that may be the target of the humoral immune response amanat et al31 generated 2 different versions of the sars-cov-2 spike protein one construct expressed the full length of sp and a second construct presented only the rbd evaluating a small number of samples from rt-pcrpositive patients reactivity to both antigens was excellent as demonstrated by optical density values however sp reactivity was significantly higher than that observed for rbd igg3 igm and iga were the dominant isotypes observed in these patient samples the investigators further reported that reactivity to a sample bank of sera obtained from patients with other human coronavirus infections was negligibleokba et al34 produced an array of different elisa to examine antibody reactivity to sp s1 np and rbd antigens a large cohort of samples was obtained from patients with other viral respiratory infections and was inclusive of 116 banked samples from patients infected with various human coronaviruses only samples from some sars-cov and mers-cov patients cross-reacted with the sars-cov-2 antigens the rbd and np elisa were the most effective in the detection of antibodies in patients with mild infection these 2 antigens were examined in a second study using samples obtained from a cohort of 16 patients obtained 14 days or longer after symptom onset38 the rbd elisa showed higher sensitivity 100 for igg and 94 for igm compared to the np elisa 94 for igg and 88 for igmokba et al34 also examined commercial elisa using the s1 antigen for the detection of iga and igg antibodies both elisa showed some cross-reactivity with samples obtained from other human coronavirus positive patients overall the iga elisa displayed a higher sensitivity and the igg elisa displayed a higher specificitylassaunire et al18 evaluated elisa constructed with rbd and s1 antigens using a control group of samples from patients with other nonsars-cov-2 viral infections the performance of a sandwich elisa for the detection of total antibody reactivity to rbd was superior to that observed for the commercial igg and iga elisa using the s1 antigen the elisa for total antibody detection provided the highest sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 100 respectively the specificity of the igg and iga assays were similar but the iga elisa had a superior sensitivity of 93 vs 67 for igg the authors reported a similar cross-reactivity of the commercial s1 elisa to other human coronaviruses as observed by okba et al34zhao et al33 also utilized a sandwich elisa to measure total antibody reactivity to rbd antigen as well as a rbd targeted elisa to measure igm reactivity alone and a np targeted elisa to detect igg reactivity examining a cohort of over 300 patient samples the total antibody assay had superior performance vs the other assays with a sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 99 respectively while the specificity of the igm and igg elisa was 99 the sensitivity of the igg elisa np was 65 compared to the igm elisa rbd at 83whitman et al6 evaluated 2 different elisa and 10 different lfia in their study the sensitivity for the elisa assays using samples obtained after day 16 post onset of symptoms was greater than 80 and the specificity was greater than 95 the agreement of the elisa with different lfia ranged from 75 to 95overall elisa assays with rbd and np antigens were the most frequently used in these early studies although the sensitivity of the assays was affected by the timing of sample acquisition a higher overall sensitivity was consistently observed with the use of total antibody detection the elisa technique is labor intensive and unsuitable for point-of-care testing however it may offer the advantage of determining antibody titers and selective isotype detection the importance of these options as clinical applications is unknown at this time overall while several elisa-based studies were robust in experimental design many reports did not include examination of important control samples to best evaluate method specificity table 2the use of clia in the detection of sars-cov-2 antibody is of particular interest as this method has excellent sensitivity with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the detection of other viral infections clia uses recombinant antigen coated magnetic beads and a lumigen substrate with analysis on automated platforms in current reports np combined np and sp and rbd antigens were most commonly used table 3822262741-46many studies utilized clia to address differences in patient populations and time of onset of symptoms vs serologic results long et al42 reported the use of the np and sp antigen combination in a study of 363 samples from confirmed and suspect covid-19 patients in their report igg-positive serostatus approached 100 at 20 days after onset of symptoms and the median seroconversion for igm and igg was 13 days using a similar np and sp assay but a smaller cohort of positive and negative patients jin et al8 reported a 48 sensitivity and 100 specificity for igm detection however for igg the reported sensitivity was 89 and specificity was 91 accuracy was higher for combined igm and igg testing with a posterior probability of greater than 99 this was followed by igg alone 90 and igm alone 86 and was corroborated in a separate study47five studies warranted a closer examination as each included control samples from patients with non-sars-cov-2 infections lin et al43 used np antigen to detect igm and igg reactivity sensitivity for both igm and igg assays was reported as 82 and the specificity was 81 for igm detection and 98 for igg detection ma et al44 compared rbd and np antigen targeted clia and reported a higher sensitivity and specificity when using the rbd antigen a superior sensitivity and specificity were also demonstrated with the detection of iga over igm or igg detection alone in addition the use of iga in tandem with the detection of either igm or igg increased assay sensitivity and specificity geurtsvankessel et al26 examined a total antibody assay for s1s2 reactivity and reported a sensitivity of 73 and a specificity of 98 bryan et al46 validated an igg antibody assay using np antigen with a specificity of 100 based on the analysis of banked samples originally submitted for hsv testing this study also included 689 samples from confirmed covid-19 patients the assay sensitivity increased from 53 at day 7 to 100 at day 17 lastly zhang et al41 used a large cohort of samples and showed an area under the curve of 099 and 100 for igm and igg respectively using a combined np and sp cliathe clia assay is traditionally considered a very sensitive method with the capability to detect low levels of antibodies clia assays are automated and allow for a high throughput of samples in the current literature review rbd and np were the most commonly targeted antigens and the studies detected igm and igg isotypes as well as total antibody reactivity the use of rbd antigen and igg detection produced the highest accuracy data among studies it is important to consider that the variation in performance among different platforms may have been related to sample acquisition timing which was not consistently reported in the studiesrt-pcr testing for viral detection is a frontline tool to detect patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection however several studies showed that the sensitivity of rt-pcr testing decreased over time post onset of symptoms and that this change was observed to be concurrent with the increasing sensitivity of antibody detection methodsguo et al32 evaluated the use of a np targeted elisa using igm iga and igg detection in a sample set of 82 rt-pcr confirmed cases and 58 suspected cases with negative rt-pcr early in disease 5 days post onset of symptoms igm detection was positive in 93 of suspected cases with negative rt-pcr results and 76 of the rt-pcr confirmed cases overall the sensitivity of rt-pcr testing alone was 52 however when using rt-pcr in combination with the elisa the total sensitivity increased to 99 similar results were observed in another study where combined detection of igg and igm identified over 70 of suspected cases that were negative by rt-pcr testing38as the course of the disease progresses the utility of serology increases as well zhao et al33 evaluated the sensitivity of a total antibody elisa to the rbd antigen in the early 1-7 days post onset of symptoms the sensitivity was 67 for rt-pcr this increased to 79 when rt-pcr was combined with elisa testing the sensitivity for rt-pcr decreased to 54 at days 8 to 14 while the elisa sensitivity increased to 90 at this time point the use of both methods resulted in a sensitivity of 97 lastly on days 15 to 39 rt-pcr sensitivity was reported as 46 and the elisa sensitivity was 100 similar trends were also observed with an igm rbd elisa and igg np elisanumerous studies indicated that antibody responses may vary according to disease severity and some reports proposed that monitoring titers may be applied in clinical practice to guide earlier aggressive treatment traditionally the hallmarks of a humoral immune response include the early expression of igm isotype which then matures into igg isotype expression notably many reports of sars-cov-2 patients indicated that igm expression was observed concurrently with igg expression long et al42 conducted a large multicenter study using an np and sp targeted clia the median seroconversion of both isotypes was recorded at day 13 in addition a different np and sp targeted clia studied by suhandynanata et al45 showed a median seroconversion on days 4 to 5 for igm and iggthe goal of several elisa studies was to define the period of seroconversion and all demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the assays by the second week post onset of symptoms20283233 zhao et al33 reported that the median seroconversion time of igm and igg to rbd antigen was days 12 and 14 respectively guo et al32 reported the median appearance of igm and iga at day 5 and igg at day 14 post symptom onset their study used serial samples obtained from the same patients and an elisa for antibody detection to the np antigen xiang et al20 also used a np targeted elisa and reported the median appearance of antibody at day 4 post onset of symptoms overall while these results are similar to that reported in a review of serologic testing for mers-cov and sars-cov they may have been affected by choice of target antigens the various immunoassay kits and the level of detail of case history used to categorize the time of sample acquisition post onset of symptoms14few studies have examined the differences in titers by case severity classification and there was no consensus among the findings tan et al49 reported that the igg and igm detection occurred earlier for severe cases compared to nonsevere cases p  05 higher titers were also observed in the former group wang et al50 evaluated the titers of igm and igg in 116 confirmed cases of which 101 of the cases had mild to moderate disease and 15 patients died levels of igm were significantly higher in deceased patients p  019 however no significant correlation was observed between case outcome and igg titers in contrast a large study of 338 confirmed covid-19 patients reported elevated igm titers but lower igg levels in critical cases51 ma et al44 evaluated iga titers in a cohort of 216 patients and observed a significant correlation with disease severity p  0001 and peak levels of iga 16 to 20 days after symptom onset sun et al40 reported significantly higher igg titers to sp antigen in non-icu patients whereas igg titers to np antigen were elevated in icu patients lastly to et al38 using np and rbd targeted elisa observed no correlation between titers and severitypreviously quantification performed by elisa and neutralizing antibody assays showed that individuals over 60 years of age had higher antibody titers than young healthy adults with human coronavirus nonsars-cov-2 infection52 notably in a study of patients recovered from covid-19 samples obtained from elderly and middle-aged individuals had higher titers of sp reactive antibody compared to young adults53 thus while increased age is often associated with severe sars-cov-2 disease and poor outcomes high levels of antibody production do not appear to be detrimental given these preliminary reportsthere were limited reports of testing approaches for the detection of asymptomatic individuals much of the current literature was weakened given the limitations in the experimental design of studies used to validate the serologic methods for example paradiso et al54 used an lfia for igm and igg detection to screen 525 health care workers previously this group reported an overall 30 sensitivity and 89 specificity obtained during the validation of this lfia it was acknowledged that the reduced sensitivity was related to the selection of validation samples from patients early after the onset of symptoms21 in the health care worker screening study only 11 of the cases were seropositive these cases tested negative by rt-pcr all the cases were positive for igm and 1 case was positive for both igm and igg another study from the same investigation group examined asymptomatic cases presenting to the emergency department21 twenty nine percent of the cases were positive by rt-pcr testing and 21 of the cases were positive by lfia testing as the lfia was not fully validated it is problematic to apply these results to develop screening strategies for asymptomatic patientsbendavid et al55 used lfia in a study of 3330 individuals from santa clara county ca and found an unadjusted antibody prevalence of 15 95 confidence interval ci 111-197 the weighted population prevalence was 28 95 ci 224-33755 the kit was validated using samples from confirmed negative and positive sars-cov-2 patients with a combined igmigg sensitivity of 80 and specificity of 99 no secondary controls with nonsars-cov-2 viral infections were included in the validation study as a result this study likely overestimated the specificity of this lfiazhao et al39 used a lab-developed elisa for the detection of igg antibody to s1 antigen with reported excellent sensitivity and specificity as determined by the use of samples from symptomatic hospitalized patients and healthy individuals in a subsequent study the same elisa was examined in 276 asymptomatic health care workers ten percent of health care workers had seropositive results samples from a small cohort of close contact individuals were also examined all subjects tested negative by rt-pcr but 1 individual was seropositive as with the study by bendavid et al55 the specificity of the elisa assay was not fully assessed this complicates the interpretation of these resultsa report of serologic testing of a family cluster of 6 individuals provided interesting data regarding the complexity of test sensitivity56 two family members were hospitalized with sars-cov-2 symptoms one individual tested positive by rt-pcr on presentation and the second patient tested negative twice before obtaining a positive result on day 5 both individuals were positive for igm reactivity by elisa the 4 remaining family members remained asymptomatic however 3 of 4 tested positive for igm reactivity and 2 of 3 were positive by rt-pcr testing at later dates the fourth individual remained clinically asymptomatic and was negative on all testingimplementation of serology testing to screen the general population and asymptomatic health care workers is currently of significant interest nonetheless the available evidence is limited to support its use in these scenarios with unclear population prevalence and the use of immunoassays that are not fully validated the limitations of test sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of asymptomatic individuals may be difficult to overcome57many studies focused on the detection of neutralizing antibodies for the potential use as a predictor of clinical outcome and in the identification of convalescent serum for use in a treatment strategy several of these studies evaluated the correlation of data from elisa using rbd s1 s2 and np antigens to the presence of neutralizing antibodies wu et al53 studied neutralizing antibodies using a pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based assay using plasmids for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 sp protein titers of neutralizing antibodies were reported as id50 highest dilution resulting in 50 reduction of luciferase luminescence parallel elisa for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbd s1 and s2 were conducted the study samples were obtained from 175 patients with mild to moderate symptoms who recovered from covid-19 levels of neutralizing antibodies were low id50 200 before day 10 and appeared at 10 to 15 days after the onset of symptoms titers persisted at similar levels on repeat testing 2 weeks later the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the patients were categorized as follows low to mid in 17 id50 500-999 mid to high 39 id50 1000-2500 and high in 14 id50 2500 samples from 30 of patients had very low levels id50 500 and included samples from 10 patients who had reactivity below the level of detection id50 40 results obtained from elisa using rbd s1 and s2 antigens correlated moderately with neutralizing antibody titers correlation coefficients ranged from 042 to 051 p  0001 ni et al37 examined rbd and np elisa in tandem with the pseudovirus neutralization test in cohorts of 6 patients tested at the time of discharge and 2 weeks later significant levels of igm and igg were present at both time points as determined by elisa methods notably while neutralizing antibody was detected at the time of discharge levels were lower in 5 of 6 patients 2 weeks laterokba et al34 compared the results of iga and igg elisa for rbd s1 and np to data obtained from a plaque reduction neutralization assay using vero e6 cells and reported a significant correlation r  088 p  01 with all elisa the strongest correlation was observed with iga reactivity r  093 p  001 it is important to note that various elisa in this study were validated with a large secondary sample set obtained from patients with other respiratory viral infections table 2the identification of novel antigenic epitopes that may be important in the humoral immune response was the focus of a limited number of studies poh et al13 evaluated the reactivity of 25 convalescent serum samples six samples showed significant neutralization activity id50 600 and were selected for further analysis additional experiments to characterize antigen targets showed that the s14 and s21 peptides within the sp provided the strongest reactivity by elisa methods and these results correlated with neutralizing activity jiang at al58 developed a microarray of 28 sars-cov-2 proteins to profile iggigm responses of 29 convalescent sera all patients had combined igmigg responses to np and s1 antigens but not to s2 antigen furthermore a significant number of samples were positive for anti-orf9b and anti-nsp5 antibodies these peptides may represent good predictors for immunity and possible therapeutic targets overall understanding the utility of routine serologic methods ie elisa clia in the prediction of convalescence is complex further comprehensive studies in this area are warrantednumerous immunoassays for the detection of antibodies to sars-cov-2 are rapidly emerging these immunoassays have the potential to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of infection in different scenarios1759-61 published and nonpeer-reviewed studies varied dramatically in the definition of patient groups time of sample acquisition sample size and inclusion of relevant control sera from patients with nonsars-cov-2 respiratory infections these are all critical variables that will affect the sensitivity and specificity of the different immunoassays and should be a fundamental part of the review of any validated assay15 determining the final roles of lfia and elisa immunoassays in sars-cov-2 testing and research is difficult at this time as this is limited by the pitfalls in the experimental design of many of these foundational studies further well-validated assays determined through studies with rigorous experimental design are neededin the current literature the study methods were heterogeneous regarding the specific antigens used and the different isotypes of antibodies measured few studies compared these variables simultaneously the most common antigens used in the assays included rbd s1 and np there was preliminary evidence that the use of particular target antigens may provide value to increase the sensitivity of antibody detection methods however additional comprehensive studies need to be conducted to reproduce this early reported data in addition antigenic epitopes within the sp appeared to be important in the immune response and thus this region remains of interest for future detailed studiesthere is compelling evidence that using total antibody or combined iggigm detection offered the highest sensitivity of detection data from preliminary studies indicated that additional investigations should examine the clinical correlation of different isotypes and titers to disease severity it is also clear that the timing of sample acquisition is a crucial determinant of test accuracy although this important information was not always clearly presented in the current literature16 the earliest positive results were reported by day 5 post onset of symptoms and accuracy peaked by the second week of symptoms early in the course of the disease when rt-pcr sensitivity was reported as 50 to 60 the concomitant use of serologic tests significantly added sensitivity with consistently reported values over 90 moreover after 10 to 14 days post onset of symptoms the sensitivity of rt-pcr dropped significantly while serology testing reached its peak as fully validated methods become commercially available serology methods may be utilized as an adjunct tool to rt-pcr testing protocols in patients with suspected infectionnearly all of the current literature focused on the results obtained using serologic testing in symptomatic patients it will be essential to define antibody responses in individuals with subclinical and mild disease before immunoassays can be used in screening and seroprevalence studies at the time of this writing while the potential importance of quantitative titers was raised in the literature testing platforms available to provide this information are largely absent from clinical laboratories lastly defining convalescence and the presence of long-lasting immunity to sars-cov-2 after infection or future vaccination is important additional studies are needed to determine if ease-of-use assays of antibody detection and quantitation will compare well with traditional neutralizing antibody assays while serologic testing continues to hold promise for various applications there are still knowledge gaps that must be clarified to give meaningful recommendations for its use in different clinical scenariosmiddle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a human beta-coronavirus hcov that is originally identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa in 2012 so far the who has reported 2229 cases of mers-cov infections in 27 countries with a fatality rate of about 36 n  791 1mers-cov-specific antibodies are widely found in dromedary camels camelus dromedarius along with viral shedding of similar viruses detected in human accordingly dromedaries are considered the primary source of mers-cov transmission to humans although the original source for the virus is still unknown 24phylogenetic analysis groups coronaviruses into four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-coronaviruses bats are considered the natural reservoirs of these viruses although sars-cov is closely related to bat cov btcov hku3 and mers-cov is closely related to pipistrellus btcov hku5 and tylonycteris btcov hku4 the serologic and antigenic relationship between these viruses is unclear generally coronaviruses across subgroups demonstrate a low level of cross-reactivity for the s protein and limited preservation of cross-neutralizing epitopes 5 6 however few studies have demonstrated cross-reactivity among these betacoronavirus it has been shown that mouse hyperimmune sera to sars-cov harbor low levels of neutralizing activity against mers-cov 5 further sera samples from sars patients demonstrated 607 1728 binding and 25 728 neutralizing activities to mers-cov suggesting cross-reactivity within subgroup viruses 7following its first isolation several laboratory diagnostic tests for mers-cov have been developed 811 molecular tests such as rt-pcr and sequencing are majorly used in diagnosing mers-cov infections 12 the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc limits the use of serological tests for investigational or surveillance settings and not for diagnosis 13 they established a two-phase serological test approach to detect anti-mers antibodies based on elisa targeting s1 antigen followed by whole-virus igg and igm iift and microneutralization test for confirmation the microneutralization assay is highly specific and it is the gold standard for measuring specific neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov in sera samples nonetheless compared with the elisa and iift the microneutralization assay requires a bsl3 facility which is not available at many places and it is labor-intensive and time-consuming requiring at least 5 days before results are available 13 14in the state of qatar twenty-one cases have been reported until 2017 including seven deaths 333 interestingly 95 n  20 of the cases in qatar were reported in males compared to only one female case thirteen of the mers cases were reported in camel farm owners and workers and five were suspected human-to-human transmissions of which three were nosocomial infections ministry of public health-qatar personal communicationqatar was the first nation to report on the isolation and full genome sequencing of mers-cov from camels 3 in a separate study from qatar reusken et al reported that  7 20294 of persons with camel contact have antibodies reactive with mers-cov s1 antigen compared to zero reactive in control or noncase contact samples using 90 plaque-reduction neutralization test prnt90 only 10 of the 20 5 mers-cov s1 antibody-reactive samples were confirmed positive 15due to the uncertain epidemiological picture of mers-cov among qatar population we designed a staged serologic surveillance study for mers-cov consisting of initial screening by anti-mers-cov igg rs1-elisa kit followed by evaluation of reactive samples using whole-virus indirect immunofluorescence assays igm- and igg-iift and ppnt we also tested the cross-reactivity of igg rs1-elisa-reactive samples with the four circulating human coronaviruses using elisa and iift this study targeted three groups i low-risk group constituted of 4719 samples obtained from blood donors bd collected over a period of five years 2012-2016 ii high-risk group represented by 135 samples obtained from baseline case contacts cc collected from individuals who were in close contact with confirmed cases during the acute phase first week and iii four samples from pcr-confirmed mers-cov patients cp the high-risk group is defined by the individuals that were in direct contact with the confirmed cases either at work house or hospital medical staff prior or after symptom development our findings suggest that mers-cov is not heavily circulated among the population of qatar additionally the presence of antibody responses to other human coronaviruses resulted in false-positive results in binding assays which mandate the need for more evaluation studies of the currently available diagnostic serological assaysin total 4858 plasma samples were analyzed in this study samples were distributed as follows 4719 plasma samples were collected from bd during previous studies 1620 over a period of five years 2012-2016 age 19-88 years mean age 37 years 135 plasma

represented the patients family members healthcare workers and camel farm coworkers samples from cc were collected within the first week of the patients admission to hospital this study was approved by qatar university-irb review exemption no qu-qu-irb 622-e16initially all plasma samples were screened for the presence of anti-mers-cov s1 subunit igg using a commercial igg rs1-elisa kit rs1-elisa

with an in-house recombinant-s1 protein iifa igg rs1-iifa institute of virology charit - universittsmedizin berlin germany as described by corman et al 2012 8 in order to reduce the possibility of

mers-cov strains the emc strain genbank jx869059 and the jordan n3 strain genbank kc776174 as previously described 21 the determination of cross-reactivity of borderline and reactive samples against

revealed 104719 021 and 1135 074 reactive samples from bd three borderline and seven positive samples and cc respectively on the other hand 34 cp 750 were reactive with igg rs1-elisa assay figure 1 table 2 since cc samples were collected within the first week of primary case identification samples were also tested by igm-iift and all were negativeas recommended by the who borderline and reactive samples were then tested for the presence of anti-mers-cov igg using whole-virus and recombinant r s1-iift analysis with whole-virus igg-iift confirmed only two 210 samples from bd as well as three 34 samples from cp interestingly none 010 of the above bd reactive samples tested positive with neither rs1-iift nor ppnt assay the positive igg rs1-elisa cc sample was only tested by ppnt and it was positive all of the randomly selected igg rs1-elisa negative bd samples were also negative by whole-virus and rs1 igg-iift tables 3 and 4to determine the status of infection recent versus older all igg rs1-elisa reactive samples were further evaluated for the presence of igm antibodies as an indication for recent infections using whole-virus iift igm-iift and only one was marginally reactive and that was from a cp table 4 strikingly one of the 13 randomly selected igg rs1-elisa igg-negative bd samples from the initial screening was found reactive for igm antibodies using igm-iift with a titer of 320 positivity of this sample was further confirmed with ppnt with ec50 titer of 500 table 3 the sample was obtained from a 35-year-old syrian citizen residing in qatardiscrepancies in the results obtained from different binding assays could be due to cross-reactivity with other viruses hence we evaluated the cross-reactivity of rs1-elisa-reactive samples for igg antibodies against all currently known human coronaviruses all tested bd samples including the negative controls from the initial screening exhibited reactivity to at least 3 of 4 human coronaviruses all rs1-elisa-reactive samples were reactive to the four seasonal coronaviruses 229e hku1 oc43-cov and nl63 table 5 the reactivity was also high in the negative controls from the initial screening reaching 100 1313 for 229e 92 1213 for hku1 and oc43 and 84 1113 for nl63 partial data is shown in table 5 none of the tested bd samples were reactive to sars-cov using whole-virus or rs1-iift igg similarly all samples from cp were also highly reactive with other human coronaviruses interestingly two of the cp samples had considerable reactivity to sars-cov with titers of 320 and 3200 using igg rs1-iift table 5discrepancies in cross-reactivity were also observed among different serological tests for human coronaviruses for example one sample from cp tested negative with whole-virus iift igg for hcov-229e but it was reactive with recombinant s1 protein of the same virus using similar assay similarly two samples from cp showed reactivity to sars-cov in the igg rs1-iift whereas only the sample with higher antibody titer reacted with the whole-virus igg-iift assay further all samples from cp reacted with hku1 spike protein in rs1-elisa but only two samples yielded positive reaction with the igg rs1-iift table 5qatar reported a relatively low number of mers cases in comparison to neighboring countries despite the fact that mers-cov continues to circulate in camels 23 24 in the absence of a clear epidemiological view of mers-cov we present here a comparative serological study for the prevalence of anti-mers coronavirus antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in qatarfollowing the who recommendation we run initial screening for igg antibodies using rs1-elisa and reactive samples were then confirmed with full virus and rs1-iift igg followed by ppnt combined results from different serological tests indicate the low presence of neutralizing anti-mers-cov antibodies in the general population in qatar 14719 while the rate increases to 1  135 in the high-risk group cc our results revealed a few interesting observations first the only confirmed positive sample from the bd group was accidentally detected when we tested 13 randomly selected negative samples originally selected to serve as a negative control from the initial screening using rs1-elisa-igg for igm response where screening for igm is not typically done in similar studies 14 this mandates the development and utilization of assays that measure both classes of the antibodies for screening processes nonetheless our results coincide with the low number of reported cases in qatar n  21 compared to the neighboring countries such saudi arabia that has the highest number of reported mers cases worldwide n  1700 25 26 in a similar study using a similar approach in saudi arabia 1510009 015 were confirmed positive for anti-mers antibodies in the general population these numbers are slightly higher than what we observed in our study 14719 002 however the low number of positive samples in both studies prevents a significant statistical analysis 14another interesting observation was the seropositivity in cc samples although those samples were collected within the first week of primary case identification only one sample was positive for igg but not for igm antibodies indicating previous exposure to the virus it also confirms that infection with mers-cov can go unnoticed and that surveillance studies shall be done systematically to include screening for igm and igg responses similar to the above observation in the general population the rate of seropositivity in the high-risk group cc in our analysis was lower 1135 074 than that observed in saudi arabia 7227 308 several factors could explain the difference between both studies including the difference in sample size as well as the demographics and livestock population in both countriesone out of four mers cp samples did not show antibody response using rs1-elisa whole virus and rs1-iift assays the sample was collected during the acute infection phase which explains the absence of anti-mers-cov igg response a recent study from south korea indicated that humoral response to mers-cov as measured by binding and neutralizing assays wean rapidly after one year of infection and becomes undetectable in about 67 of those who show mild illness upon infection 27 in another study from korea it was shown that none of the asymptomatically infected individuals showed seroconversion however the seroconversion rates gradually increased with increasing disease severity reaching 600 938 and 100 in symptomatic infection without pneumonia pneumonia without respiratory failure and pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure respectively 28 such studies indicate that human humoral immune response to mers-cov is a complicated phenomenon that requires further investigation it further implies that the infection rate with mers-cov in the middle east could be underestimated and that the fatality rate associated with mers-cov infection is most likely overestimatedas observed in other studies the rs1-elisa resulted in significant false-positive results while 104719 02 samples were positive in this assay only 210 20 were positive with whole-virus igg-iift and null were confirmed with rs1-iift and ppnt 0 similarly out of 10009 tested samples in the saudi arabia study 152 were positive with rs1-elisa 15 17 of which 11 were positive with whole-virus iift and 15 were confirmed with neutralization assay 14 these results indicate cross-reactivity between mers-cov and other human coronaviruses to test this further we employed several binding assays to test the reactivity of our samples with five known human coronaviruses namely sars hku1 229e oc43 and nl63 cov interestingly all mers-reactive samples from first screening as well as most of the randomly selected negative control samples had cross-reactivity to at least 34 seasonal human viruses but none of them were cross-reactive with sars-cov on the other hand two of the cp samples were cross-reactive with sars-cov with intermediate titers accordingly it is not clear which of the human coronavirus is inducing this cross-reactivity with mers-cov which mandates further investigation we also observed discrepancies in cross-reactivity when using different assays where rs1-based iift were more sensitive than full virus counterparts that could be due to the higher concentration of the specific s1 protein in the first assay which also ensures the use of defined regents purified proteins for developing screening assayson the other hand cross-reactivity between sars and mers-cov has been reported earlier a 2013 study by chan et al indicated that 1728 607 of sars patients had significant binding antibody titers using iift of which seven 25 had anti-mers emc neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of hcov-oc43 7 in the same study bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant b-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of spike protein between the two viruses 7we acknowledge few limitations to our study including the use of elisa procedure to screen for anti-mers-cov igg response dominance of males over females 4642 versus 77 and non-qataris over qataris 3791 versus 928 as well as the screening at one-time point our findings affirm on the use of neutralization assay and to a lower extent spike protein-specific iift as confirmatory tests considering the high cross-reactivity among different human coronaviruses such findings were similar to what has been recently reported by drosten et al who showed that excess in igg detection by anti-mers rs1-elisa igg was not confirmed with igg-iift assay 29our results indicate a high discrepancy between different assays available in the market to screen for anti-mers-cov antibodies elisa-based assay seems to be more prone to produce false-positive results while results of iift should always be confirmed by neutralization test most of the available elisa assays utilize s1 protein which is part of the whole protein and in many cases is not well characterized before use using affinity purified and structurally defined protein might be more reliable to produce accurate results the recent determination of several ectodomain structures from many coronaviruses should be instrumental to design better immunogens 3036 which can also be utilized to develop more specific screening assays lastly further investigation of the possibility of mers-cov transmission through a blood transfusion from asymptomatic donors should also be assessed though no cases have been reported so far with evidence of blood transfusion as a source of mers-cov infectionin december 2019 numerous cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan china 1 in january the novel causative virus named sars-cov-2 was identified which spread to other chinese regions and to other countries causing a world pandemic 23 the clinical presentation of this disease named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 varied from asymptomatic or mild flu-like symptoms to severe bilateral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and death a rapid replication of the virus within the first 24 hours from the infection and the relatively high about 3 reproduction number were described 4the available viral genome sequences allowed to soon recognize the close relationship between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 the causative pathogen of the 2002-2004 outbreak presenting with severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsboth viruses belong to the coronaviridae family they are characterized by a single-stranded 30 kb positive-sense rna and enveloped spherical virions of about 160 nm the unusual large size of their genome leaves these viruses enough space to rearrange their genes recombination thus donating them some genomic plasticity 5 furthermore rna biosynthesis seems to use a virus-specific template switch which results in transcription of sub-genomic mrnas and eventually leading to homologous rna recombination 5 nevertheless by encoding a 3-5exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 nsp14-exon which is required for high-fidelity replication the mutation capacity of sars-cov-2 is debated 6 in the end somehow the plasticity allowed coronaviridae to acquire a rich strains biodiversity and the ability to jump species which already caused previous zoonotic outbreaks as for mers-cov and sars-cov 7 8 9starting from observed similarities in a short region of rdrp gene between sars-cov-2 and a bat coronavirus batcovratg13 further sequences were identified to be 96 identical at the whole-genome level corroborating the hypothesis of animals to humans spill-over 10as of june 3 more than 6 million cases of covid-19 have been declared including more than 380 thousands of deaths 11 because of the rapid and fatal spread of the pandemic the research on development of diagnostic tests was set a priority for infection control measures and patients carethe present review summarizes performances and limitations of diagnostic tests to help clinicians in the interpretation of the results and clinical managementthree of the major challenges in molecular diagnosis are 1 to detect small amount of viral rna for reducing the number of false negatives 2 to differentiate the positive signal among different pathogens for decreasing the number of false positives and 3 to have a large capacity in order to quickly and correctly test a large number of patients while avoiding false negatives and false positives molecular and serological tests were previously compared during the sars-cov-1 epidemic showing an increased sensitivity and specificity for the molecular ones for this reason real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr represents the validated assay for early diagnosis in patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection 12first publications showed that diagnosis was possible by targeting the spike s gene of the virus with a good specificity differentiating sars-cov-2 from sars-cov-1 but limited sensitivity 10 sensitivity was further improved when integrating other viral-specific genes such as rdrphelicase hel nucleocapside n and envelop e genes 13 a comparison between all targeted genes revealed that best results were obtained with rdrphel genes 14 and who guidelines recommend the use of rdrp e n and s genes in different combinations 12 in our institution we introduced the who recommended test described by corman et al targeting the e gene followed by confirmation with rdrp primers 13 on our fully automated molecular diagnostic platform 15 rna extraction was performed through the magna pure 96 system roche basel switzerland and the rrt-pcr was carried out on a quantstudio 7 system applied biosystems waltham united states 15 we observed low sensitivity of the rrt-pcr targeting the rdrp gene due to a mismatch in the primer also described by corman and collegues 13 and since the e gene was constantly more sensitive than rdrp we decided after having performed about 1000 tests to continue addressing the e gene only 16 this allowed us to save reagents and to be able to perform an increasing number of tests in a setting of reagents shortage due to the pandemic nature of covid-19 to detect a possible drift due to mutations and to avoid that a mutant strain escape our diagnostic test we kept targeting both e and rdrp genes once a weekrna extraction methods can generally be classified into i one-step with the rt step and the pcr reaction in the same tube and ii two-steps rt-pcr initial creation of dna copies with rt reaction followed by their addiction to the pcr reaction typically one-step pcr uses one reaction-tube minimizing the risk of contamination false positive results on the other hand two-step pcr allows for archiving the cdna sample and further testing of other genesas pointed out in a recent work from pang and colleagues 17 there are different rna extraction platforms summarized in table 1
 which can allow to improve sensitivity and tat but also sometimes increase the costsdespite the good performance of the validated naats there is still a risk of false negative results most of them concern the pre-analytic setting such as the timing of the specimen collection too early or too late in the infection course including the limit of detection due to late infections with atypical manifestations the quality of sampling insufficient material or type of specimens bronchoalveolar lavage -bal exhibits the highest sensitivity followed by induced sputum naso-pharyngeal -np swab oro-pharyngeal -op swab and feces and finally the sample transport inappropriate container exposure to extreme temperatures etc 18 19 further reasons decreasing the performance of a molecular test include the ability of the virus to mutate changing sequence of the regions in which primers are hybridizing or the pcr inhibition 20 the latter being nowadays almost insignificant in our laboratory we observed an inhibition in about 03 of the tested sampleswith the purpose of reducing the tat of naats several rapid microarray and sequencing solutions built on multi-rt-pcr panels and automated systems have been developed 17 21 an important highly performing test although expensive and not useful for a high number of samples is the genxprt sars-cov-2 test cepheid httpswwwcepheidcom which due to its simplicity and its very short tat rapidly helped patient management especially regarding isolation procedures 22finally several manufacturers already developed other advanced specific systems 23 24 25 26 27 28 and investigations showed their easiness rapidity and compatibility with automation 29 30one of the down-sides of serological assays is the limited sensitivity at early stage when the host has not yet developed specific antibodies in the specific case of sars-cov-2 data from literature showed a production of igm and igg starting after the first week from infection and generally detectable from the second 31 32 33 34 leaving some space for delayed antibody responses previously associated for mers-cov with more severe disease 35another conundrum is to avoid the cross-reactivity between antibodies against different viruses part of the same or different families this is particularly difficult since most of the human coronaviruses are antigenically closely related 36 although solvable by adding a virus neutralization test as previously suggested by who during sars epidemic in 2004 37sensitivity and specificity of serological assays can also be affected by the target antigen as highlighted by meyer and colleagues the s protein produced in more advanced stage of sars-cov-2 infection showed lower levels of sensitivity and more specificity especially the s1 subunit compared to the n protein 38 noteworthy we recently observed a coste et al data not shown that the antibodies directed against the n protein seems to decrease earlier than the s protein thus the sensitivity of assays targeting only the n protein may be impaired according to the timing of infection figure 1
 for this reason we recommend to systematically use two tests one targeting the s protein and one targeting the n protein for diagnostic purposes for sero-epidmiological studies a test targeting the s protein is recommended the added value to target the s protein is that the titers will likely better reflect protection against reinfection in table 2
we summarized the interpretation of diagnostic microbiological tests according to the time of infection the presence or absence of symptoms and the type of diagnostic test used interestingly the high specificity of the s protein was corroborated by a study on sars-cov-2 spike protein epitopes showing that even considering the homologies with sars-cov-1 the virus of covid-19 exhibits novel antibody epitopes 39 this translates in the lack of efficacy of sars-cov-1 antibodies against covid-19 40 but at the same time it reinforces our trust in the specificity of the serological test when targeting s proteinsthere are currently a huge number of tests on the market 21 ideally only high quality assays with sensitivity greater than 95 and specificity superior or equal to 98 should be used as well as for naats different platforms can be considered also for serological tests the lateral flow assays lfa often exhibits a lower sensitivity then the enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa and chemo-luminescent immune-assays clia 41 among the different lfa we identified the dynamiker tianjin as one of the best being both sensitive and specific coste et al2020 submitted for publication nevertheless we preferred elisa and clia which enable larger series and less hands on time in lausanne we initially started on 14th april using a elisa based assay epitope diagnostics usa that was targeting the n protein this elisa exhibited 96 of sensitivity on samples taken 15 to 30 days post-infection and a specificity of 100 on 450 samples taken before the outbreak coste et al2020 data not shown submitted for publication more recently we moved to clia the snibe run on maglumy instruments china target the n protein alike the roche clia runring on cobas instruments switzerland conversely the abbott test running on the m2000 instruments usa and the diasorin test running on the liaison instruments italy both target the s proteinas mentioned median time for seroconversion is of about 10 to 14 days 31 32 33 but early seroconversion has also been documented already 3 to 5 days post-infection 34 interestingly the appearance of igm occurs at the same time than igg thus the main advantage to also test igm is to assess the timing of the infectionthe need of developing point-of-care devices to reduce the tat and increase the number of daily tests have stimulated the research towards faster and simpler kits numerous manufacturers quickly developed rapid immuno-chromatographic point-of-care tests already available on the market 21at this point data are being gathered on the diagnostic gain obtained through these rapid kits and further and more accurate studies are warranted which can define sensitivity and specificity of the tests in relation with timing of infection and targeted proteinsin a complex scenario such as the ongoing pandemic not only the diagnoses need to be timely and accurate but laboratory testing needs also to provide epidemiological information in order to assess the magnitude of the event and the spread rate in this setting serological assays can become helpful both to complete the epidemiological link when molecular diagnosis results are negative and to alleviate the burden of laboratories implicated in molecular diagnosis 12 in this way a rapid point-of-care serological assay cheap and simple enough to be affordable by any hospital if used correctly not at an early stage of disease could allow enlarging the spectrum of tested population especially among those who did not develop enough symptoms to require hospitalization hence molecular testing at the same time if used as an asset for population screening at the right time and as adjunctive to the reference method the overall epidemiological information gained could account for the sensitivity loss in early stage of diagnosis indications for serological testing are summarized in table 3
while serological assays can represent a useful epidemiological asset naats remains the gold standard for diagnosis due to their high sensitivity even at early stages of the diseasefollowing the quantification of viral load over time and integrating that with information on sample collection technique and timing might be helpful to differentiate different stages of the disease viral quantification will also provide information regarding the value of testing different samples from different parts of the bodydue to the main respiratory tropism of sars-cov-2 best samples for sensitivity come from the respiratory tract in particular np swabs showed higher and longer persisting viral loads than op swabs 42in one hand due to the higher concentration of the virus in the lower respiratory tract it could be argued that sensitivity of np swabs is still not enough to avoid false negative results on the other hand samples from lower respiratory tract such as bal or bronchial aspirates require invasive procedures not possible without intubation in subjects already suffering from severe respiratory insufficiencyfinally the decision whether to trust or not a negative np swab should be always corroborated by the clinical presentation of the patient 43 and if possible completed by serology testing if a strong clinical suspicion is present the repetition of the test is recommended a new np swab is the first option since often the false negative np test is due to inadequate sampling of only the distal part of the nasal cavity repetition of the test with a lower respiratory tract sample will be advisable for those patients admitted to the hospital hence with heavier symptoms but stable enough to be submitted to invasive procedures if the patient is asymptomatic but still considered at risk of infection due to specific exposure investigating the serology between 10 and 15 days after the exposure could help to document an asymptomatic infectionsamples like blood and urines were found to be weakly-to-none sensitive while the virus was also found in feces and perineal swabs of patients with gastro-intestinal symptoms 44 45 indicating another sample deserving further investigationsanother consideration is whether the local respiratory gastro-intestinal microbiota play a role against the diffusion of the virus which together with the immune system diversity might contribute to the variety of clinical presentations and affect different viral concentrations 46 47finally considering this rapidly evolving pandemic and its zoonotic outbreak more knowledge needs to be gathered from further studies in the diagnostic field both investigating the specific features of this virus and novel diagnostic approaches possibly combining the molecular methods with the serologic ones in order to booster sensitivity and specificity results despite the desperate need to implement naat or serological test the introduction of these tests needs to be done with high quality criteria to assess the performance of the tests in order to avoid a massive amount of false positive and false negative results to save time the validation of these tests should be centralized to reference laboratories and then rapidly implemented in other laboratories upon validation of the performance of the testdr caruana dr croxatto dr opota dr coste dr lamoth dr

after symptom onset with all assays achieving 97 to 100 agreementserological testing is a complementary test in covid-19 diagnosis and a strategic vehicle in the second phase of the pandemic necessary for epidemiological study and lockdown exit programmes immunoassays could provide identification of non-contagious and potentially protected individuals to support progressive de-confinement strategies in the process of gradually restoring safe economic and social activity 1011 different types of serological tests are available on the market and could be applied to the massive testing challenge the world is currently facingfully automated clia and elisa assays allow the quantitative determination of antibodies against sars-cov-2 by clinical laboratories with increased screening capacity in this study the elisa iggiga was tested on a fully automated microtiter plate analyser the workflow for elisa tests depends on the analyser used in our laboratory the capacity was 90 tests per 3-4 hours in contrast the clia iggigm assays are fully automated random-access tests this technology allows up to 180 tests per hour depending on the platform used with the results delivered in about 40 minutes the performance of maglumi iggigm tests has been successfully evaluated by padoan et al showing the reliability of these immunoassays for assessing the immunological response in the sera of covid-19 patients these tests show that it takes at least 12 days to reach 100 sensitivity for igg and a 88 positive rate for igm 12 in another study that compared the maglumi iggigm and euroimmun iggiga 100 sensitivity was observed with maglumi igg 10 days following onset of symptoms these authors reported a lower sensitivity for the maglumi igm 60 compared to the euroimmun iga 100 13 in the current study the maglumi iggigm tests also showed overall lower sensitivity than the euroimmun iggiga test 643 vs 844 but in contrast their specificity increased to 100 the mean days since symptom onset in the population tested for this study was 1146 days median of 10 days this can explain the lower sensitivity of the maglumi iggigm tests in our study as compared to those in the literature obka et al 8 also described higher sensitivity observed in the euroimmun iga test than in the euroimmun igg test 836 vs 617 this was particularly evident in the two first weeks after symptom onset but with less specificity for the former test 861 vs 986recently many commercial lateral flow assays have been developed and ce-labelled in this study three of these were also evaluated the results showed that their global sensitivity specificity npv and ppv were equivalent to the elisa iggiga or the clia iggigm tests in addition excellent concordance between the five immunoassays tested in this study was observed 14 days after the onset of symptoms similar results were reported by li et al showing good sensitivity 886 and specificity 906 with a rapid test in a large cohort of patient samples in china they observed similar performances with serum plasma and fingerstick blood 14 rapid serological tests can be performed in the laboratory or used as point-of-care tests poct the latter will provide accurate results within 10 to 15 minutes with equivalent sensitivity and specificity as the quantitative automated immunoassays particularly two weeks after onset of symptoms the opportunity to test outside of the clinical laboratory by lateral flow assay makes it possible to reach larger population groups without saturating the capacity of the laboratories poct may play an important role in large-scale testing in order to evaluate herd immunity against sars-cov-2 however mistakes in the interpretation of results in situations that are not under the control of trained staff must be taken into consideration for this reason the development of automated reader devices could help to reduce errors and increase sensitivity in addition such a device could support the transmission of the results to a public health institution to provide real-time information about seroprevalence at the population levelwhile still awaiting the results of large seroprevalence studies in the community wu et al report a detection rate of around 10 of sars-cov-2 igg in asymptomatic subjects from a single-centre investigation 15 the causal relationship between humoral response and illness severity is still unclear zhao et al revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titres two weeks after illness onset 16 yongchen et al highlight the complementary role of immunoassays to rt-qpcr in the diagnosis of covid-19 particularly in critical patients with a negative rt-qpcr they observed seronegative asymptomatic patients four weeks after positive rt-qpcr results 17 in the current study two asymptomatic patients tested seronegative by all the immunoassays 20 days after a positive rt-qpcr result further studies in asymptomatic patients are necessary to understand better the humoral responses in this population and to understand the role of the real herd immunity in determining lockdown exit strategiesthis study has some limitations first this is a retrospective study performed with residual samples and the lack of fresh serum could impact the accuracy of the results second no reliable gold standard for serological tests is currently available for comparative studies and little literature exists concerning a comparison of immunoassay methods for sars-cov-2 detection furthermore the criteria for assessing the time of illness onset were recovered from medical records and may contain imprecisions due to subjectivity in the perception of symptoms and timingin conclusion this study shows the accurate and equivalent performance of five serological antibody assays elisa clia and three lateral flow tests in detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of covid19 symptoms making them compatible for application in the clinical context and in developing epidemiological strategies for the covid-19 pandemicthe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 2019-ncov iggigm rapid test

stomatitis virus vsv agent is classified as a vesiculovirus under family rhabdoviridae and is widely distributed in north and south america15 two serotypes of vsv circulate in the united states new jersey vsvnj and indiana vsvin isolates exhibit a low level of genetic variation and only four distinct genotypes have been detected in the united states and mexico vsv commonly infects horses cattle goats sheep and pigs clinical disease is rare in llamas serologic evidence of vsv infection in alpacas has been reported16 alpaca vsv isolates have been classified as genotype g215 and most infections with vsv are subclinical and go unrecognized viral infection is localized in the epithelial cells of the mouth excess salivation is the most common clinical sign of vsv infection fulminant disease is characterized by formation of vesicles in the mouth tongue nostrils feet and teats the incubation period of vsv is about 28 days death is rare but animals may refuse to eat mild antiseptic mouthwashes may be applied to prevent secondary infections little-to-no immunity develops against vsv and no vaccine is currently available to protect against this disease other differential viral diseases to consider in diagnosis are rabies orf contagious ecthyma and foot-and-mouth disease a serious foreign animal disease because vsv is a reportable disease in the united states if you suspect vsv contact your states usdaaphis area veterinarian-in-charge who will arrange to collect appropriate samples to be sent to the national veterinary services laboratory in ames iowa samples to be submitted include serum for vsv-serum neutralization testing for both serotypes vesicular fluid and epithelium scrapings are also collected for virus isolation and pcr if vsv is detected and confirmed the animals will be placed on quarantine for 30 days after the symptoms disappear this is a seasonal disease with more cases happening in summer and fewer in winter17 epidemiologic maps indicate that viral outbreaks occur in populations located along riversfoot-and-mouth disease fmd is caused by an apthovirus belonging to family picornaviridae it is an rna virus that has seven immunologically distinct serotypes and subtypes18 susceptible species include cattle sheep goats pigs bison and deer new world camelids appear to less susceptible to fmd virus19 foot-and-mouth disease is a major barrier for trade around the world because it can cause serious morbidity and mortality in livestock13 the role of new world camelids in fmd epidemiology is controversial depending on the type of virus contracted individual responses vary based on an experimental study after exposure to fmd strain a24 llamas developed vesicular lesions on their extremities20 in this study animals did not excrete virus in esopharyngeal fluid beyond 8 days13 therefore it is likely that camelids play a minor role in transmission of fmd virus because they do not become carriers of the virus although not performed commonly llama embryo transfer presents a low risk for transmission of fmd21
papillomaviruses are small nonenveloped dna viruses that infect the skin of animals these viruses replicate exclusively in skin and mucosal surfaces are resistant to disinfectants and stable in the environment camelid mucocutaneous fibropapillomas were reported on the lips nose nares and cheeks in two llamas and three alpacas all 6 years of age22 lesions on the face appeared as hyperkeratotic gray nodular tumors to confirm a diagnosis of papillomavirus fresh skin biopsies can be submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for pan-papillomavirus pcr based on a partial sequence of a conserved sequence of the e1 gene of papillomavirus the camelid papillomavirus has a 73 homology with bovine papillomavirus-1 and 64 homology with canine papillomavirus a rabbit polyclonal antibody is available for diagnosis of most animal papillomaviruses however it has not yet been demonstrated to be useful in diagnosing camelid fibropapilloma cases electron microscopy can also be used to diagnose papillomavirus infectionsspeculation about potential effects of bovine viral diarrhea bvd virus infection in nwc were initially viewed with skepticism about the disease potential of the virus23 because early evidence centered on serologic studies and sporadic reports of bvd viral infections being associated with respiratory disease enteric disease and occasional abortions23 a pestivirus bvd has two biotypes cytopathic and noncytopathic based on production of cytopathic effects in cell culture and is further classified as two major genotypes type i and ii both have been reported in nwc bovine viral diarrhea virus has now been shown to be involved in nwc cases of diarrhea ill thrift reproductive losses respiratory disease and disseminated disease23 24 25 and it is capable of causing multisystem effects in nwc in much the same manner as bvd viral infections in cattle sheep and goats25 the serologic incidence of bvdv in nwc has been reported to be from about 4424 to as high as 5323 one of the major effects of bvd viruses upon nwc is infection of nave animals during pregnancy resulting in abortion or establishing an immunotolerance in the developing fetus via congenital infection the hallmark of the congenital infection is the formation of a cria that is persistently infected pi in much the same way that has been described for bvd virus pis in cattle the literature has been gracious in regards to documenting the occurrence of bvd pi crias and of major importance biosecurity measures to minimize contact of pregnant bvd-nave alpacasllamas with bvd virus-infected herd mates including commingling with cattle sheep and goats23 much of the clinical interpretation and pathogenesis of bvdv in nwc is derived from studies in cattle production of pi in cattle is a characteristic of bvdv recently pi has been reported in alpacas in north america and europe25 26 27 28 29 because the gestation period is much longer in nwc than in cattle the period of susceptibility of the camelid fetus for induction of pi has not been accurately determined bvdv has been isolated from a stillborn alpaca fetus30 however the number of bvdv-induced abortions is still rare in nwc the virus has been isolated from crias that fail to gain body weight27 ocular and nasal infections have also been reported28
detection of bvdv in nwc is diagnostically challenging31 most bvdv-detection assays used for cattle such as virus isolation serum-neutralization and rtpcr can be used in nwc however the commercial antigen-capture elisa test can give false positive results because nwc serum samples cause high background reactions diagnosis of bvd viral infections in nwc follows strategies similar to cattle including virus isolation from key tissues lymph nodes whole blood fetal tissues and placenta pcr from whole blood and immunohistochemistry ihc on formalin-fixed tissues the availability of bvd virus pi-specific assays for cattle has not yet been validated for nwc these assays use ear notch elutes or serum from suspected animals that are tested for bvd viral antigen by an elisa or antigen-capture elisa ace studies conducted on naturally infected bvd virus pi crias have indicated that the serum may be suitable for testing until further validation studies are conducted screening nwc by bvd viral-specific pcr on whole blood will detect active infectionviraemia either acute transient infection or a pi and serology on serum will detect neutralizing antibody indicating prior infection and probable immunitya recent nationwide survey reflected the extent of bvd viral infection in the united states32 of the 63 herds tested 25 had bvd seropositive crias and 6 had evidence of bvd virus pi crias seropositivity to bvd virus was linked to the feeding of supplemental bovine colostrum containing bvd viral antibodies the study emphasized the need to establish biosecurity measures that prevent transporting female alpacas with crias at side to other farms for breeding if the cria is persistently infected with bvd the probability of bvd virus infection to susceptible nave females in other herds is a high risk experimental inoculation of alpacas vaccinated with a killed bvd viral vaccine resulted in seroconversion by all the animals and protection against a challenge infection with a field strain of alpaca bvd virus type 1b s byers and colleagues personal communication 2008 although licensed vaccines are available for controlling bvd viral infections in cattle none are labeled for use in nwc use of bvdv vaccines for nwc is not recommended because the disease is not a widespread problem in camelidsadenoviruses are double-stranded dna viruses that have been associated with a variety of clinical conditions though infection may present only as subclinical disease four cases of adenovirus infections in llamas have been reported33 bronchopneumonia involving a large portion of the lung in a 5-month-old llama was described mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy was displayed by the second llama both llamas had fibrinous pleuritis and serosanguinous pleural exudates the third llama had chronic wasting and respiratory alkalosis llamas 3 and 4 both had fibrinous peritonitis and pleuritis histologic examination of liver showed large intranuclear inclusion bodies compatible with adenovirus infection virus was detected by fluorescence antibody testing in the lung parenchyma of all four animals using a porcine adenovirus conjugaterotavirus rv has been documented as a cause of diarrhea in south american camelids34 based on serum antibody prevalence rv is quite common in south american camelids 779835 in one report group a rotavirus was isolated from two newborn guanacos from farms 700 km apart that had previously reported severe outbreaks of diarrheal disease during calving the presence of rv was confirmed by electron microscopy circulating antibodies against rv were not detected in either animal indicating a failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies coronavirus infection was not detected in the two young guanacos from either farm based on bovine coronavirus antigen and serology testing however bacterial infections due to escherichia coli and salmonella were detected both guanacos were captured hand raised and fed with bovine milk based on electrophoresis both farms experienced a distinctive long dsrna electropherotype of rv that differed from each other and also from bovine rv isolates both rotaviruses were genotype g8 however the bovine p types of the rv were p1 and p1435 a subsequent serologic survey conducted on the two farms indicated a high 95 prevalence of antibody titers in the herds36
coronavirus is the most common viral cause of enteritis in young crias and adult camelids32 37 38 the diarrhea due to coronavirus in camelids can be severe and require intensive therapy in one report alpaca coronavirus was involved in 42 of the cases of diarrhea the virus was detected throughout the year37 alpaca coronavirus is closely related to antigenic group 2 bovine coronavirus39 in a recent case report38 an adult 4-year-old alpaca experienced weight loss nutritional stress and foul smelling watery diarrhea antigenic group 2 coronavirus related to bovine coronavirus was detected by rtpcr and ihc38 diagnosis of coronaviral diarrhea can be achieved by electron microscopy or by pcr techniques it has been speculated that the association of coronaviral diarrhea in alpacas may be an indication of a stress nutritional immunologic and so forth and may be a stress indicator james evermann personal communication 200938 39 there is a preliminary report that acute respiratory syndrome ars a recently described disease also known by the colloquial term snots in the alpaca industry is caused by antigenic group i coronavirus40 the disease is associated with mild-to-severe respiratory presentations and on postmortem examination interstitial pneumonia is observed with lymphocytic infiltrates thus indicating a viral cause kochs postulates have not been fulfilled however based on serology the animals from herds with a reported history of ars have been found to have increased antibody titers to the group i coronavirus40
herpesviruses are stable double-stranded dna viruses that cause respiratory disease abortions ocular infections and nervous system diseases most herpesviruses are highly host-specific although there are rare reports of transmission of herpesvirus infections to other species after close contact41 the occurrence of disease following infection of nwc by equine herpesvirus-1 ehv-1 was a major turning point in studies of infections capable of causing clinical symptoms in alpacas and llamas before this report41 serologic data had indicated that nwc were susceptible to infection as determined by specific antibodies but apparently resistant to many equine and bovine viruses an outbreak of blindness and encephalitis due to infection with ehv-1 occurred in a group of 100 camelids on an exotic animal farm in new york state one year after their import from chile41 four animals developed neurologic disease unlike ehv-1 infection of horses which causes a systemic infection the pathogenesis of ehv-1 in nwc involved infection of the nasal mucosa followed by spread to the olfactory nerve optic nerve and then cns the blindness in these animals was characterized by dilated unresponsive pupils that were confirmed by fundoscopic examination and there was evidence of vitritis retinal vasculitis retinitis chorioretinitis and optic neuritis in 21 alpacas and one llama all affected animals were seropositive for antibodies to ehv-1 virus isolated from brain and eye tissues was experimentally tested for virulence by intranasal infection of three llamas42 two animals developed severe neurologic disease and one developed mild disease lesions developed in brain and retina after experimental infection and the virus was recovered from thalamus of one animal42 vaccines are available for prevention of ehv-1 in horses only but as a rule they are not to be used off-label to protect nwc unless the animals are in close proximity to horses only killed vaccines should be considered in the nwc until further safetyefficacy studies are conducted with modified live virus vaccinesrabies is an important zoonotic disease that is introduced mostly from wildlife to domestic animals and humans43 reports of rabies virus infections in camelids are rare but spread of rabies from alpaca to alpaca can occur12 44
rabies viral infection in camelids is primarily spread by feral dogs although the red fox skunks and bats have also been reported as transmitters in dromedary camels there are two forms of rabies raging fury and the more rare silent fury incubation ranges from as short as 3 weeks up to 6 months during the final paralytic stage dromedaries will be recumbent and attempt to yawn continuously very characteristic in nwc rabies results in an aggressive form and rarely the paralytic form the major symptoms are self-mutilation and attacks upon humans and penmates it has also been noted that nwc cannot spit due to the paralysis of pharynx diagnosis of rabies must be handled by a veterinarian and is conducted by standard methods on impression smears of fresh brain prevention of rabies can be achieved by barrier vaccination of animals in close proximity to camelids such as dogs and cats killed vaccines have been successfully used in both owc and nwc melanie boileau personal communication 2009eastern equine encephalitis eee virus is an alphavirus that belongs to the family togaviridae it is transmitted seasonally by mosquitoes to horses and humans who are dead-end hosts for eee there is one retrospective case report with eight alpacas and one llama45 central nervous diseases can be difficult to diagnose in camelids due to their stoic nature but clinical signs may include lethargy twitching of head and neck opisthotonus seizures vestibular signs and ataxia like other viral encephalitides eee induces an increased protein concentration and mononuclear pleocytosis the mortality rate in these cases was close to 90 the virus was localized in the brain tissue the lesions were not detected in the spinal cord the diagnostic tools include virus isolation rtpcr on brain tissues and ihc on brain tissue serology can be used as a supportive tool a killed eee vaccine is under evaluation for camelids46 camelids are also susceptible to western and venezuelan equine encephalitis viruseswest nile virus wnv is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is indigenous to africa asia europe and australia it is transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes that have fed on birds that carry the virus since 1999 nwv has spread progressively across the united states so that it is now regarded as an endemic infection camelids are relatively genetically resistant to wnv the attack rate clinical symptoms is low compared with the overall infection rate primary clinical symptoms of wnv infection are ataxia hyperesthesia and recumbency there are three reports of wnv encephalitis in alpacas ranging in age from 3 months to 7 years46 47 48 the clinical signs reported include fever lethargy depression anorexia encephalitis head tremors ataxia stiff gait altered mental status and hyperesthesia treatment with hyperimmune camelid serum with wnv-neutralizing antibodies can provide protection in the early stage of the mnv infection49 a neutralization assay is available for antemortem diagnosis rtpcr can be performed on brain tissues to confirm the pathologic diagnosis as can ihc on selected fixed brain and spinal cord tissues there is one report that a licensed equine wnv vaccine is safe for use in camelids however the efficacy of the vaccine has not been determined49
bluetongue virus btv is a double-stranded segmented rna virus belonging to the family reoviridae genus orbivirus that has the ability to evolve and spread to new geographic areas due to culicoides vector transmission50 there are 24 serotypes of btv and it has recently emerged in parts of europe there are a few reports of serum antibodies against btv in camelids from south america the susceptibility of camelids may be affected by the virulence of the infecting btv in one experimental infection with bluetongue serotype 10 both inoculated llamas remained clinically normal but became seropositive after 12 weeks51 there is one published report of lethal bluetongue infection in a 5-year-old female alpaca with a cria52 before death the alpaca developed respiratory symptoms with coughing and hiccup-like breathing on postmortem examination the adult alpaca had erosions and ulcers on the tongue palate and buccal mucosa and severe congestion interstitial pneumonia and alveolar edema in the lung mild hypertrophy of type ii pneumocytes was observed by histopathology the cria remained healthy a competitive elisa for detection of bluetongue antibodies has been published51 the main impact of btv seropositivity in camelids may be the effect upon animal trade50
a few other viral infections have been reported in camelids however evidence for disease due to these viruses is limited a yearling llama that had a 6-month history of weight loss lameness and opportunistic infections tested positive for retrovirus reverse transcriptase in macrophages and lymph node53 consistent with retroviral infection a complete blood count showed neutropenia and lymphopenia and the animal had generalized lymphoid hypoplasia and plasma cell depletion the llama also developed pneumocystis carinii infection of lungs suspected equine arteritis virus eav abortion was reported in a herd of alpacas but the diagnosis was not confirmed54 the virus was detected by rtpcr in fetal tissues collected from a female alpaca that aborted in her last trimester of gestation54 all five animals in the herd had antibodies to eav there is a preliminary report of isolation of bovine herpesvirus in a llama with bronchopneumonia55
pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from the respiratory tract of the llama infectious bovine rhinotracheitis ibr herpesvirus was confirmed by virus isolation yet the animal was negative for ibr antibodies by serum neutralization test this lack of antibody response may have been to due to acute deathas our knowledge regarding infectious diseases of camelids has increased it has become apparent that institution of external and internal biosecurity measures must become a standard by both producers and the veterinarians that serve them according to a recent review56 biosecurity can be defined as those efforts designed to prevent the introduction and subsequent spread of a disease in a population of animals these efforts can be further divided into external measures and internal measures table 1
 external measures are those steps that are directed at preventing introduction of new diseases into a group whereas internal measures are aimed at minimizing the spread and subsequent disease in populations where an infection is already established or endemic to be valid the minimum biosecurity plan should address 1 the means of isolating new animals introduced into an existing population of animals 2 the regulation of animal movement and on-the-farm worker and equipment traffic and 3 the practical design and implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures that are specifically directed at reducing the pathogen load within the population of animalsalthough the diagnosis of camelid viral diseases is still relatively new the observation that there is considerable interspecies spread of viruses see fig 1 among camelids and members of the equine and bovine species allows for veterinarians in search of diagnostic capabilities to locate reputable diagnostic laboratories to assist in disease diagnosis and biosecurity surveillance table 2
lists those infectious agents that may be encountered the table is divided into subclinical infections where a biosecurity profile would be of interest in a presalepurchase preshipment for regulatory purposes and prebreeding the profile usually includes serology testing for brucella abortus btv bvdv and johnes disease serology bvdv pi detection and coronaviral shedding electron microscopy or serology these biosecurity profiles may vary from region to region and it is best to contact the laboratory for specifics on proper samples form of shipment and laboratory fees the other section of table 2 lists those diseases that may be suspected and the samples that can be collected either antemortem or postmortem this section of the table is further divided into where the predominant disease symptoms are manifested such as respiratory reproduction neurologic or skin it is best to contact the laboratory before collecting specimens to determine the best samples to collect for maximizing diagnostic resultsdiagnosis of camelid viral diseases is offered at the followingnew york animal health cornell university ithaca new york httpdiaglabvetcornelledu

 a similar tree topology was obtained using the maximum parsimony data not shownin this study the presence of crcov in italy was clearly demonstrated by using serology and rt-pcr by means of serological testing the prevalence of crcov in italy was found to be similar to those assessed in uk 36 and republic of ireland 30 priestnall et al 2006 rather than those observed in japan 178 kaneshima et al 2006 and north america 547 priestnall et al 2006 the bcov-based elisa test suggested that a group ii coronavirus has been circulating in the italian dog population not before 2005 whereas the first report of crcov identification in uk dates to 3 years ago erles et al 2003 however due to the absence of representativity of the samples examined it should be taken into account that these data are only indicative of the real circulation of the virus the seropositivity increased with the age of the dogs since crcov antibodies were detected at higher frequency in dogs over 6 months of age with respect to younger dogsa hi test for crcov antibodies was also established taking advantage on the presence of the haemagglutininesterase protein in all group ii coronaviruses that is responsible for haemagglutination of mouse erythrocytes however assuming the elisa test as the gold standard the hi test was proven to be poorly specific and sensitive therefore not recommendable as an extensive diagnostic test the poor specificity may be related to aspecific inhibitions of the haemagglutinating activity by substances present in the sera whereas the lack in sensitivity may be a consequence of the high antibody titres probably required to prevent haemagglutinationa definitive evidence of the presence of crcov in italy was provided by the molecular identification of a s-gene fragment in the lungs of a cpv-positive dog showing high identity to the analogous nucleotide sequences of the crcov strain detected by erles et al 2003 despite the wide distribution of the virus in the organism as determined by the rt-pcr positive results obtained from several tissues attempts to isolate the virus on hrt-18 cells were unsuccessful this finding could be explained with low amounts of virus present in the tissues or alternatively with virus inactivation during transportation or storage a poor sensitivity of hrt-18 cells could be ruled out as this cell line has proved to be highly permissive for crcov growth erles et al 2006 although the dog was not reported to have respiratory signs at necropsy some lesions were observed in the lungs however the involvement of crcov in the death of the infected dog could not be demonstrated since a co-infection by cpv-2 was detectedto date outbreaks of crcov infection have been reported in uk erles et al 2003 japan kaneshima et al 2006 and canada ellis et al 2005 the present study reports the first detection of crcov in a country of the continental europe enduring epidemiological surveillance will help a timely identification of future outbreaks and a more in-depth comprehension of the pathogenic potential of crcov in dogsas of march 8 2015 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has caused at least 1082 mostly severe cases of respiratory infection 439 of these fatal since its discovery in 20121 apart from its geographical focus in countries in and around the arabian peninsula and laboratory evidence of widespread infection of dromedary camels little is known about the actual epidemiology of the disease in human beings1 2 3 4 5 few primary infections were acquired through direct camel exposure but the relevance of this infection pattern is unclear in the absence of systematic determinations of the proportion of infections in individuals who have had contact with camels5 6 7 moreover most reported patients with primary mers-cov infection have no history of camel exposure suggesting the existence of other as-yet-unknown sources of infection camel milk as a food-borne source seems unlikely8
for secondary infections acquired through human-to-human contact mathematical projections predicted that transmission chains in the population cannot be sustained9 10 11 the apparent transmission rate in household settings is low with fewer than 50 of index patients transmitting the infection to contacts who subsequently had no pronounced clinical symptoms12 however a highly fatal outbreak of mers-cov infection centred in jeddah saudi arabia in marchapril 2014 was apparently caused by human-to-human transmission in several nosocomial settings without any evidence that the causative virus differed from other mers-cov strains in people in terms of replication in cell culture immune escape or excretion level13 undiscovered mers-cov infections might thus exist in the human populationserology is key to the understanding of infection statistics at a population level however only a few serological studies of mers-cov have been done14 15 although none of those preliminary studies showed any evidence of previous infection with mers-cov in the population of saudi arabia the examined cohorts have been small and methods applied in those studies have not been validated for sensitivity and specificity we previously presented the first validated recombinant elisa relisa for mers-cov and combined this test with recombinant immunofluorescence assay rifa and a plaque reduction virus neutralisation test prnt into a staged strategy for mers-cov serology that was shown to identify even subclinical infections on detection of specific antibodies12 here we apply the established testing algorithm on a nationwide serum collection additional serum samples were obtained from individuals occupationally exposed to dromedary camelsfor the cross-sectional serosurvey we used existing sample collections organised by the ministry of health of saudi arabia individual serum samples were obtained from healthy people older than 15 years selected to represent all ages excluding children and adolescents 15 years in the saudi arabian population samples were obtained with written informed consent given to the ministry of health from participants in households randomly selected in a population-based cross-sectional sampling frame maintained and updated by the national census bureau16 participants lived and gave samples in all 13 provinces of saudi arabia sampling was done through primary health-care centres and hospitals under the supervision of the ministry of health we obtained two collections of serum samples from local primary health-care clinics for individuals selected to participate in a survey of the national burden of disease16 17 and a second collection of samples from individuals selected for a national study of the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virusadditionally we obtained serum samples from camel shepherds who participated in an ad hoc mers-cov surveillance study implemented by the ministry of health and expatriate slaughterhouse workers in makkah the shepherds gave verbal consent and the slaughterhouse workers gave direct written consent in the frame of the ad hoc surveillance studyall serum samples were anonymised before the study and were tested for mers-cov antibodies without further institutional review because the testing of all samples was done as part of a public health intervention by the saudi ministry of health we applied an anti-mers-cov elisa igg euroimmun ag lbeck germany with minor modifications the relisa was based on the soluble mers-cov spike protein subdomain s118 this highly sensitive assay has been validated for use with human serum samples12 samples were applied at a 1100 dilution the cutoff optical density ratio was set to 03 which is three times the ratio of the mean value of all tested human serum samples without known exposure to camelswe used rifa to substantiate relisa results because rifa has been shown to be more specific than relisa12 rifa was done with the full mers-cov spike open-reading frame expressed in verob4 cells12 19 for igg detection serum samples were tested at a 140 dilution for igm detection samples were analysed at 120 and 1100 dilutionswe did plaque reduction neutralisation tests prnt as previously described20 the first applied dilution of a two-fold dilution series was 110 in accordance with our previous study12 we defined a 120 dilution as the lowest possible diagnostically significant titre20 we recorded serum dilutions conferring 50 and 90 plaque reduction as prnt50 and prnt90 titres respectivelywe defined stage 1 seropositivity as reactivity in both relisa dilution 1100 and rifa dilution 140 we defined stage 2 seropositivity as stage 1 seropositivity plus reactivity in prnt with a reciprocal titre of at least 20 on prnt50 we regarded stage 2 seropositive results as serological confirmation of past mers-cov infectionto compare the age distribution of patients with serologically confirmed cases with that of patients with clinically apparent cases we examined data from international case-notification statistics21 and index-case data from a study of household contact clusters12
we did a two-tailed mann whitney u exact test with spss software version 21 we did 2 tests and fishers exact tests and calculated cis with openepi open source epidemiologic statistics for public health we applied 2 tests in the seroprevalence calculations of the general population versus camel-exposed individuals and for comparisons of agegroups we used fishers exact tests for calculations of geographical and gender comparisons we applied the non-parametric mann whitney u test to compare the mean ages of patients with mers in different studiesthe funders of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationbetween april 1 and june 30 2013 we obtained 5765 serum samples from local primary health-care clinics for individuals selected to participate in a survey of the national burden of disease16 17 and a further 4244 samples between dec 1 2012 and dec 1 2013 from primary health-care centres data for patient demographic characteristics appendix were available for 8719 87 of 10 009 stored serum samplesadditionally we obtained serum samples from 87 camel shepherds who participated in a mers-cov surveillance study from feb 1 to may 31 2014 and 140 expatriate slaughterhouse workers in makkah during august 2013 the camel shepherds were aged 2184 years mean 379 years sd 1302 and resided in six different provinces al-jouf asir eastern madinah makkah and riyadh the slaughterhouse workers were aged 1562 years mean 3713 sd 864the mean sample size per province was 770 range 321 to 2343 sd 585 representing between 197 and 971 samples per 100 000 individuals per province mean 529 sd 267 the age distribution of samples with available age information matched that of the population of saudi arabia figure 1

 appendix because repeat samples were missing the timepoint of seroconversion was established by igm detection coronavirus igm had been previously shown to be maintained for a maximum of 180 days after infection22 only one of 15 seropositive individuals had a reciprocal mers-cov igm titre of at least 100 suggesting recent seroconversion appendix in accordance with our previous study12 seropositivity with relisa was ten times higher than with rifa seroprevalence did not differ between the two subcohorts seven 016 of 4244 patients in the primary health-care study group vs eight 014 of 5765 in the burden of disease study cohort group p094 appendix men had a higher proportion of infections 11 025 of 4341 than did women two 005 of 4378 p0025 cases were identified in four of six age groups without significant age preference appendixconfirmed cases of mers-cov infection were identified in six of the 13 administrative provinces of saudi arabia with higher numbers in central provinces that generally are more rural figure 2
 the 13 provinces were classified into seven central and six coastal provinces on the basis of whether they had a shoreline significantly more confirmed infections were in central provinces 14 026 of 5479 samples than in coastal provinces one 002 of 4529 p0003the proportion of both camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers who were seropositive was significantly higher than in the general population table 1 seropositive individuals were identified in five of six age groups with even distribution appendixboth registered patients ie patients with confirmed mers21 and index patients from the household study were significantly older than the serologically confirmed individuals in our present study table 2
 detailed laboratory results in the appendixin our study we identified antibodies against mers-cov in 015 of samples from the general saudi arabian population the true number of infections is difficult to estimate because our sample consisted of only 10 009 003 of the whole population of 29 994 300 people however by combining two cross-sectional subcohorts we could cover all 13 provinces and achieved an age distribution of our sample that largely matched that of the general population panel
 all geographical regions of the country were sampled with a reasonably low variation in the proportions of population that were studied per province to have optimum sample coverage per province we included samples from an earlier study unpublished report for which detailed information about sex and age was not available for 26 of samples nevertheless samples from both subcohorts should be similar in age and sex composition because both were previously obtained according to calculations by the national census bureau to represent the composition of the saudi arabian population this similarity was lent support by the highly similar seroprevalence when we analysed both subcohorts separately even if we had only used data from the more thoroughly documented burden-of-disease study subcohort for which we had sex and age information for 97 of the samples the overall seroprevalence would have been maintained 015 in the overall sample vs 014 in the subcohortpanelresearch in context
systemic review
we searched pubmed with the terms human coronavirus emc or mers-cov and identified 463 english-language reports published before jan 20 2015 two previous studies14 15 reported an absence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov antibodies in a few cohorts of serum samples obtained in saudi arabia from 2010 to 2012 one study investigated 266 individuals from the eastern province14 this study included 158 serum samples taken from children admitted to hospital for infections of the lower respiratory tract from may 2010 to may 2011 and 110 plasma samples from male blood donors taken during december 2012 the other study15 assessed samples taken from 130 male blood donors from jeddah during 2012 and 226 slaughterhouse workers in jeddah and makkah in october 2012 no nationwide cross-sectional antibody surveys have been reported in any of the countries in the middle east known to be affected by mers-cov including saudi arabia jordan united arabic emirates oman qatar kuwait and yemen
interpretation
we did the first nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey for mers-cov antibodies in the population of saudi arabia to explore the putative presence of unrecorded mers-cov infections we noted that 015 of mainly male individuals in six of 13 had specific anti-mers-cov antibodies additionally we identified a seroprevalence of mers-cov that was 1523 times higher in camel-exposed individuals such as shepherds and slaughterhouse workers than in the general population none of the individuals who tested positive for mers-cov antibodies had severe illness before or at the time of sampling the mean age of all identified seroconverted individuals was significantly lower than that of patients with mers admitted to hospital in summary our data suggest that middle-aged men with regular camel contact could sporadically introduce mers-cov into the general population these subclinically infected individuals might represent the unknown source of infection for the many reported patients with mers with no anamnestic camel exposureto obtain an estimate of the total number of seropositive individuals in saudi arabia we did a straightforward extrapolation based on the proportion of stage-2-positive serum samples in both population subcohorts excluding shepherd and slaughterhouse worker samples extrapolation by simple multiplication suggests that 44 951 seropositive individuals 95 ci 26 97171 922 could exist in a total population of 29 994 300 our serological assays might have missed some infections because the high specificity of rifa and prnt could encompass a reduction in sensitivity of the overall serological algorithm however even a projection based on relisa results only would raise the estimated infection rate by about ten times which is several orders of magnitude lower than figures expected for a respiratory disease that continuously transmits between human beings in accordance with our previous study12 seropositivity with relisa was ten times higher than that with rifa12 this rise can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of relisa and by putative crossreactivity of low-affinity igg which is raised in individuals with recent infections from the common-cold coronavirus23
despite low detection rates antibodies were identified widely across saudi arabia including in provinces where outbreaks in people have not been reported widespread acquisition of infections without subsequent causation of outbreaks corresponds to the concept of a predominantly zoonotic disease that does not readily spread between human beings the raised prevalence in rural regions and the significantly increased proportion of infection in groups that are occupationally exposed to camels emphasises the importance of zoonotic acquisitions by dromedary camels5 6 7 however even though the analysed shepherd samples were collected in six different regions during the first months of 2014 the sampling was not randomised and samples were not strictly taken at the same time as those from the general population similar limitations apply for the slaughterhouse worker samples direct comparison of seroprevalences between these groups and the general population cohort might thus be biased matched case-control studies could be used to substantiate the raised seroprevalence in exposed groupsdirect animal contact has been reported for only a few primary cases in saudi arabia and elsewhere the younger age of serologically confirmed patients in our study compared with people with laboratory confirmed infection underlines the possibility that mers-cov might cause unrecognised infections that cause no or mild symptoms in healthy younger aged 1544 years and socially active populations these subclinical infections could act as an unknown source for index patients who cannot recall contact with camels importantly the predominance of men even within serologically confirmed cases emphasises a potential association with animal exposure because typically more men than women in saudi arabia associate with camels during leisure activities cases of mers in younger people aged 45 years might seem mild or even subclinical similar to cases in our study of household contact clusters12 in which contacts were younger than index patients and mostly asymptomatic mers might constitute a zoonotic disease that causes enough short-transmission chains in the young male population of saudi arabia for which older and predisposed individuals constitute a sentinel population

declaration of interests
we declare no competing interestscoronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in humans mammals and birds in humans the virus causes respiratory tract infections which are mild but may be lethal in some cases coronaviruses are a group of an rnavirus and also known as a 2019-ncov virus coronaviruses are viruses in the subfamily orthocoronaviridae of family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and have a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry 8 31 the genomic size of coronavirus varies from 26 to 32 kilobase 7 coronaviruses are categorized into four genera ie alpha beta delta and gamma where alpha and beta are responsible for causing infection in humans 17 there are seven strains of human coronaviruses viz human coronavirus 229ehcov-229e human coronavirus oc43hcov-oc43 sars-cov human coronavirus nl63hcov-nl63 new heaven coronavirus human coronavirus hku middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and hcov-emc novel coronavirus 2019-ncov also known as wuhan pneumonia or wuhan coronavirus the coronaviruses hcov-229e -nl63 -oc43 and -hku1 frequently circulate in human population and cause respiratory infection in adults and children the incubation period for human coronavirus is 25 days 15 as it is communicable disease and transfer from one person to another person through a droplet and direct contact 9 the recent identification of fourth human coronavirus hcov-nl63 was diagnosed from a 7-month-old child who suffers from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis symptoms of coronavirus are feeling tired difficulty in breathing fever coughing and sore throat as the symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases including flu and common cold in this review we have explained the actual mechanism of coronavirus and its overexpression in the cell membrane fig 1for identification of active infection serology test was performed for the surveillance purpose serology test was performed however it has its own limitation ie it cannot be considered as diagnostic test in this test antibodies to mers-cov can be finalized from previous infections 34 the populations of certain places which are disease-ridden with mers infection are suspectable for molecular test and clinical tests to identify active infections of mers-cov 22 to identify the viral rna within reckonable samples a molecular test called real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr are vividly used for identification and confirmation of mers-cov infection entails as per central for disease control and prevention cdc there must be either a positive rrt-pcr result for at least two definite genomic targets or single positive target with the sequencing of a second target as per cdc the united states has approved an rrt-pcr assay for mers-cov the test is thru under the buff of an emergency use authorization but human error poor laboratory conditions and ignorance while testing the samples is such prevalent factors which could affect the capability and proficiency of rrt-pcr test for this rrt-pcr assay cdc recommended collecting multiple samples including lower and upper respiratory sample serum and stool specimen cdc considers a patient under examination to be negative for active mers-cov infection when one negative rrt-pcr test on the mentioned specimen cdc consider mers patient to be negative for active mers-cov infection followed by two successive negative rrt-pcr tests on all samples 1the peoples who had infection to mers-cov serology test helps to identify antibody from them these types of antibody have the capability to attack attenuate kill the hosted virus within the immune system the presence of antibodies to mers-cov shows that a person had been formerly diseased with the virus and develops an immune response confirmation to date recommends there may be a wider range of mers disease than was initially thought for example a public health investigator has recognized individuals who are pcr-positive but have no mers symptoms we do not know if mers-cov can be spread by these people cdc has a two-phase methodology for serology testing using two screening tests and one confirmatory test to distinguish antibodies to mers-cov 6 the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa is a screening tests to detect the occurrence and concentration of specific antibodies that is bind to a viral protein cdc recommended elisa test for antibodies against two different mers-cov proteins viz nucleocapsid n and spike s to identify the neutralizing antibodies the microneutralization assay is a good confirmatory test which helps to measure specific antibodies in serum specimens however compared to elisa the microneutralization assay is a laboratory intensive and time-consuming method and requires at least 5 days before the result are available if a clinical sample is found to be positive either by elisa or microneutralization the specimen is determined to be confirmed positive 5 if a clinical sample is found to be positive by both elisas and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be intermediate if a clinical sample is found to be positive by only one elisa and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be negative 18 in the end a final determination of a confirmed positive serology the result needs to be a positive elisa test and confirmation by microneutralization assay mers-cov serology test is used for surveillance test not for diagnostic purpose-these are the tools which developed in response to the mers-cov outbreakin 1965 two scientists tyrell and bynoe studied the human coronavirus named b814 found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of a person with common cold the existence of an infectious agent was demonstrated by inoculating the medium form these cultures in human volunteers in this experiment colds were produced but the growth of agents does not occur at the same time other two scientists hamre and procknow got to succeed in growing virus with unusual properties in tissue culture from samples which were picked up from adults with colds hamre named this virus as 229e hamres virus 12 in the late 1960s tyrell with a group of scientists worked on human strains and other animal viruses which included infectious bronchitis virus mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine which were morphologically the same as seen through electron microscopy 12 this new category of viruses was called coronavirus and was accepted as new genus of viruses further research gives more information about the epidemiology of human respiratory coronaviruses like it was found that in temperate climates respiratory coronavirus infections occur more often in the winter and spring 29 after three decades of discovery human strains oc43 and 229e were studied like many other viruses the reinfection was common as the research continues to explore the pathogenicity and epidemiology of the human coronavirus the importance and number of animal coronaviruses were growing rapidly in 2003 the new virus sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was identified which first infected humans in southern china sars-cov killed 774 people and at least 8000 people were infected 23 sars infection affected 29 countries since 2004 there have not been any known cases in the world 16 the transmission of sars is primarily from person to person symptoms are like influenza-like and include fever malaise headache diarrhea and shivering the evolution of this virus demonstrated that this virus is not stable virus and can adapt to become more virulent even lethal to humans after that another outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 cause many deaths and later spread to other countries it was called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov as its origin was middle east the spread of infection occurred worldwide however most cases of deaths occurred in the middle east from2012 to 2018 the total number of cases reported was 2274 from 27 countries out of which 817 associated deaths were reported there are no further reports of cases of mers-covbut now in december 2019 there was an epidemic of new novel coronavirus in the city of wuhan china and was named as 2019-ncov 14 this infection is closely related to sars-cov and mers-cov 30 in december 2019 wmhc reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia most of the people who were infected had exposure to the huanan seafood market where poultry bats snakes and other wildlife animals were sold the cause of viral pneumonia was not sars mers influenza virus or adenovirus on january 10 reports came that the newly identified 2019-ncov has been isolated from patients with the help of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods on jan 2020 217 patients were infected with 2019-ncov out of which 9 patients died there are more than 20623 confirmed cases and at least 427 people have died as of 3 feb 2020 the virus has spread to at least to 20 countries including us australia thailand hong kong taiwan macau singapore japan south korea france malaysia canada germany nepal india and uaeafter close introspection from the chinses government it was tangible that the outbreak of covid-19 was ignited from fish and wild animal market of wuhan city china during november 2019 33 the virus has prominent intention to grown itself within the serum or raw blood within the mutilated bodies of animals birds and fishes after proper incubation within the animal blood the virus transmission occurs due to the human trespassing and mobilization as per who guideline to prevent an individual from contamination one can frequently wash hisher hand using sanitizer containing 70 ethanol 15 hydrogen peroxide 15 deionised water avoid unprotected animal contacts use of ffp1-3 mask as per whos most recent guideline march 31 2020 a patient with acute respiratory illness with certain symptoms of cough shortness of breath and a history of traveling in foreign territory is susceptible for community transmission of covid-19 disease heshe must be treated in quarantine at list for 14 dayschloroquine has some devastative and quandary effects against any kind of rna virus ie hepatitis a and c rabies polio hiv influenza a and b influenza a h5n1 lassa zika hendra nipah and ebola virus 27 chloroquine has also some lethal effects against some dna virus as well such as hepatitis b virus and herpes simplex virus but unfortunately very few clinical researches have been carryforward to detect the antiviral activity of chloroquine as far as the corona virus pandemic is concerned benefits of chloroquine were remarkably reported for sars-cov-1 in in-vitro cell line studies it was confirmed that chloroquine has significant inhibitory effects on the replication of hcov- 229e in epithelial lung cell cultures the chloroquine has been most prominently active against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the chloroquine has significant impact on establishing endolysosomal pathway as sars-cov-1 virus try to vandalize this pathway hence chloroquine could be very effective against novel corona virus a recent paper stated that both chloroquine and antiviral remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 in vitro and proposed that these drugs to be assessed in human patients suffering from covid-19 as far as its mechanism of action is concern against novel corona virus it has multiple mechanisms in which in step-by-step it inhibits the pre entry of virus penetration within the cellular surface receptors the chloroquine was found to have inhibitory effects against enzyme called quinone reductase 2 a structural neighbor of udp- n -acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids the chloroquinoline interferes the biosynthesis of sialic acid by which human coronavirus hcov-o43 and the orthomyxoviruses cannot utilize sialic acid moieties as receptor due to which the virial glycosylation on virus cell surface receptor would stop due to alkylation of endosome chloroquine shows in-vitro anti-viral effect when added to vero cells prior to virus exposure the mechanism is likely to be rapid annulment of virus endosome fusion with fluctuation of endosomal ph through endocytosisbased on the initial studies and positive outcomes of chloroquine indian council of medical research icmr on march 24 2020 suggested that those patients who are corona positive and the doctors and other healthcare professionals who are handling covid-19 patients are advised to take hydroxychloroquine a chloroquinoline derivative as a preventive drug as hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug has assumed prophylactic effects against covid-19 but as per forbes article by willam a haseltine march 25 2020 hydroxychloroquine has ineffective treatment of patients hospitalized with covid-19 the small controlled trails were conducted in shanghai public health clinical center china with 15 patients by giving 400 mg hydroxychloroquine dose for 7 days the results are not that much surprising when the treatment group was compared with the controlled group after ct scans it was observed that treatment group has less significance difference than the controlled group total 93 of patients in the control group tested negative for covid-19 after 7 days compare to 867 of patients in the hydroxychloroquine treated group the results were not that much favorable and statistically indistinguishableas per who on march 31 2020 no new country reported new cases on covid-19 for the last 24 h however the numbers of infected cases are alarming globally almost 75890 confirmed cases and 36405 deaths were reported till march 31 2020 as per who report more than 800000 surgical masks 873000 gloves 54000 n95 masks and 24000 face shields were exported in 75 countries along with covid-19 testing kits to 126 countries by operations support and logistics oslon 15 january 2020 the case

more information please see the disease outbreak news published on 12 january 2020in india the patient was detected with novel coronavirus in keralas thrissur district and the patient kept in an isolation ward while the number of people under observation 28 the condition of the woman patient a medical student from wuhan university was stable 11 the woman now in an isolation ward at the general hospital in thrissur is likely to be shifted to the medical college hospital there soon health officials were awaiting a result of one more testgene sequencing only after which it can be stated that the patient was affected with the virus 24 three others who had returned from china are also in isolation wards in thrissur of the four students who returned from china one of them has tested positive of the total 1053 people under observation after traveling to china as many as 247 arrived in the state on thursday while 15 people including seven who got admitted on thursday are under observation in isolation wards at various hospitals across the state the remaining are under home quarantine so far a total of 24 samples have been sent to the national institute of virology in pune for testing and 15 of them turned out to be negative while that of the woman tested positive 20after long hurdle and extensive research scientists have come to a conclusion that flavilavir an anti-viral drug has the potential to eradicate novel coronavirus this drug now subsequently promoted for marketing by national medical products administration since the outburst the flavilavir was developed by zhejiang hisun pharmaceutical company from the clinical research data it is postulated that flavilavir could play a game changer in the management of novel coronavirusin the above study of corona virus there are the various recent cases of corona virus affected patient human beings are addressed in the latest by 2020 so in the above article various causative agents and the mechanism of action of the corona virus are determined and studied the corona virus is of the various kinds and the most lethal corona virus is wuhan corona virus 2019 there are the two different diagnostic tests of the corona virus are discussed in the above study now days corona virus is spreading in the various regions of the world so maintain good hygienic conditions so that one should live a healthy lifein december 2019 the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in china leading to an ongoing pandemic 12 reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr of respiratory specimens represents the gold standard for identifying patients with acute sars-cov-2 infection as well as asymptomatic carriers its timely development allowed containment of the pandemic in many countries successful future management of the diseases spread will require the serological detection of past infection to determine immunity 3 especially in healthcare workers this is of outmost importance to identify immune personnel that will treat vulnerable patient groups and for the planning and management of infection preventive measures it also allows the identification of plasma donors for therapeutic interventionslately several commercial assays for the determination of sars-cov-2 igg became available in this study we compared four assays in respect to their sensitivity and specificity75 sera of 56 patients hospitalized in the university hospital rwth aachen germany were included into this study 25 sera were collected from 25 patients with a negative sars-cov-2 pcr result in respiratory specimens 50 sera were collected from 31 patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr result in respiratory specimens sample and data acquisition were approved by the medical ethics committee of the university hospital rwth aachen ek 09320 three semiquantitative elisas the anti-sars-cov-2 elisa igg euroimmun germany the edi new coronavirus covid-19 igg elisa epitope diagnostics edi usa and the recomwell sars-cov-2 igg elisa mikrogen germany as well as one qualitative immunoblot based on a set of immunoassays in a microarray format the sars-cov-2 virachip igg immunoblot viramed germany were compared in this study for the detection of sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody titersin analogy to a previous study 4 the sars-cov-2 igg status of the sera was defined as follows a serum was regarded as sars-cov-2 igg negative if at least three of the four assays compared here had a negative test result applying the manufacturers interpretation criteria on the other hand a serum was regarded as sars-cov-2 igg positive if at least two of the four assays had a positive test resultcomparison of the kinetic of the sars-cov-2 igg titer was done using the three semiquantitative elisas and sera of 2 covid-19 patients of whom several consecutive sera were available to allow comparison of the semiquantitative values between assays the values were divided by the assay-specific cut off value for normalization normalized values of   1 represented a positive test result75 sera were included in this study 25 of which were collected from patients with a negative sars-cov-2 pcr result and 50 from patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr result in respiratory specimens the sera of patients with negative sars-cov-2 pcr result were drawn on the day of pcr examination the sera of the 31 patients with positive sars-cov-2 pcr were collected 119 days  50 days post onset of symptoms each serum was tested in parallel with four assays for the presence of sars-cov-2 igg antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers three elisas from euroimmun epitope diagostics edi and mikrogen as well as one immunoblot from viramed the sars-cov-2 igg status of a serum was determined as described in study designusing the euroimmun assay 21 sera were classified as sars-cov-2 igg positive 54 were classified as igg negative with the edi assay 25 sera had a positive result three an intermediate result and 47 a negative result the mikrogen assay and the viramed assay revealed 19 and 17 positive test results as well as 56 and 54 negative results respectivelyapplying the criteria described in study design 22 sera were considered sars-cov-2 igg positive and 53 sera were regarded as igg negative all sera collected from patients with a negative sars-cov-2 pcr were sars-cov-2 igg negative 28 out of 50 patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr exhibited a negative antibody testthe rate of correct positive and the rate of correct negative test results of the four assays is displayed in table 1
 they result in a sensitivity of 864 100 864 and 773 for the euroimmun assay the edi assay the mikrogen assay and the viramed assay respectively the corresponding results for the specificity are 962 887 100 and 100the kinetics of the sars-cov-2 igg antibody titers could only be compared for the elisa assays resulting in semiquantitative values for comparison the semiquantitative test results were normalized as described in the study design section values of 1 and above represent positive test resultswe found that the kinetics of the sars-cov-2 igg antibody titers differed for each assay moreover the time point of seroconversion of each assays differed for both patients in one patient the edi assay was the first to give a positive test 8 days after onset of symptoms followed by the assays of euroimmun 9 days and mikrogen 10 days whereas in the second patient the mikrogen assay was the first to give a positive test result 8 days after onset of symptoms followed by the assays of edi 9 days and euroimmun 11 days thus it took at least 10 days after onset of symptoms to obtain positive test results in all three assayswe also noticed that the edi assay has a smaller range of linearity compared to both of the other tests preventing the proportional detection of a further increase of antibody titers with timesars-cov-2 specific antibodies are usually only detected more than one week after onset of symptoms 5 limiting the role of serology for identification of acute infection however serologic assays are urgently needed to supplement the diagnostic repertoire in identifying patients with past sars-cov-2 infection this is important for i the prognosis of the further course of the pandemic ii the identification of presumably immune health care workers who can work with vulnerable groups of patients and iii the identification of potential plasma donors for therapeutic transfusion furthermore serologic assays might allow for the detection of patients presenting during a later stage of the disease when viral clearance may precede the disappearance of symptomsas today the elisa of euroimmun is the only validated commercial elisa available in germany according to a recent publication 3 this commercial igg specific elisa exhibited lower specificity and sensitivity compared to in house assaysrecently additional antibody test assays became commercially available the aim of this study was to compare four commercially available serological assays for sars-cov-2 igg the euroimmun assay and 3 new igg assaysthe strength of the edi assay is its high sensitivity however we found a comparatively low specificity and narrow linear range on the other hand the viramed assay is highly specific but showed the lowest sensitivity both the euroimmun assay and the mikrogen assay had a medium sensitivity regarding specificity the mikrogen assay reached a higher level than the euroimmun assay in our test settingin respect to the identification of sars-cov-2 igg positive health care workers and plasma donors with high levels of sars-cov-2 igg specific antibodies specificity and linear range are the most important aspects of the assays thus the euroimmun assay and the mikrogen assay appear to be most suited to fulfill both requirements with a somewhat better performance of the mikrogen assay in our experimental settingin conclusion the four tested sars-cov-2 igg assays showed sufficient specificity and sensitivity for identifying individuals with past sars-cov-2 infection moreover combination of two different assays may further increase sensitivity and specificity especially at early time points after onset of symptoms 10 days however more studies are necessary to fully assess the performance of these assaysthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectornonecoronaviruses of humans have been classified as a subfamily of the coronaviridae family the viruses are roughly spherical enveloped particles 120160 nm in diameter their name derives from the characteristic crown-like projections on their surface approximately 20 nm long they are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses are sensitive to heat and lipid solvents and have a distinct replication strategy common to other viruses in the order nidovirales 13 coronaviruses have in the past been divided into three groups in part because of increasing work on coronavirus discovery in the wake of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 a number of new coronaviruses of humans hcovs have been identified this has resulted in the three groups being reclassified as genera of the coronavirinae subfamily before the sars outbreak while it was recognized that the coronavirus infected many different species particularly domestic and laboratory animals their extreme diversity in nature was not fully appreciated although severe diseases of differing characteristics were known to occur in animals in humans the viruses were thought to cause only acute respiratory infection which were generally mild all this changed with the recognition that sars was caused by a coronavirus sars-cov this signaled that coronaviruses could produce lethal disease and encouraged more broadly based research on the agent and its prevention and control in the process two new respiratory or endemic coronaviruses have been identified as causing human infections which appear to resemble in epidemiologic characteristics those previously known very recently mers middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus a novel human betacoronavirus lineage c virus has been discovered zoonotically infecting humans in middle eastern countriesin light of the differences between the endemic respiratory and the sars coronaviruses in terms of epidemiology and clinical expression they will be covered separately in much of this chaptercoronaviruses were first identified from domestic and laboratory animals before they were identified in humans infectious bronchitis virus of chickens was actually isolated in embryonated eggs in the 1940s the late recognition of these viruses was in large part because of difficulty in recovering the human viruses using standard cell culture techniques 4 the first human coronaviruses were identified by different techniques in the united kingdom and the united states at approximately the same time the british medical research councils common cold research unit had been studying fluids collected from persons with natural respiratory infections by standard cell culture isolation methods and by inoculating them into human volunteers rhinoviruses or other cytopathogenic agents could be recovered from a portion of the fluids 5 there was an additional substantial portion from which no agents could be isolated but that could still cause colds in the volunteers organ cultures of human embryonic trachea or nasal epithelium were then used in an effort to detect the recalcitrant viruses present a specimen b814 that had been collected in 1960 from a boy with a common cold had not yielded a virus on inoculation into cell culture after the specimen had been passaged serially three times in human tracheal organ culture it could still cause colds on inoculation into volunteers which indicated that replication had taken place 6 in chicago during the winter of 1962 five agents were isolated in primary human kidney cell cultures from specimens collected from medical students with common colds the viruses were ultimately adapted to wi-38 cultures and exhibited a type of cytopathic effect cpe not previously seen a prototype strain 229e was selected for characterization and was found to be rna containing ether labile and 89 nm in diameter but distinct serologically from any known ortho- or paramyxoviruses sera collected from the five medical students all exhibited a fourfold rise in neutralization antibody titer against 229e 7 it became clear that these novel viruses were of more than passing significance when organ culture methods were added to standard cell culture techniques in a study of acute respiratory infections of adults conducted at the national institutes of health nih six viruses were found that grew in organ but not cell culture and were ether labile on electron microscopy the agents were shown to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv in structure and these represented a distinct family of viruses 8 the b814 and 229e strains were soon also demonstrated to have a similar structure on electron microscopy and to develop in infected cells by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles 9 10 as a result of the similarity of the human agents to ibv and also to mouse hepatitis virus mhv they were collectively considered to represent a group of vertebrate viruses distinct from the myxoviruses antigenically and structurally 11 the name coronavirus was eventually adopted for the group to describe the fringe of projections seen around them on electron microscopy 1 except for 229e none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture mcintosh et al reported successful adaptation of two of the nih isolates oc organ culture 38 and oc43 to the brains of suckling mice 12 these strains were shown to be essentially identical antigenically but quite distinct from mhv only oc38 and oc43 could be so adapted the other four oc strains resisted such attempts the ibv was known to exhibit hemagglutination under certain conditions but no such phenomenon had been demonstrated for the human strains until oc38 and oc43 were adapted to mice kaye and dowdle found that the infected brain preparations would directly and specifically agglutinate red cells obtained from chickens rats and mice 13 this technique greatly expanded the ability to do seroepidemiologic studies since it was simple and reproduciblesubsequent developments included adaption of oc38 and oc43 to growth in cell monolayers either mouse brain or organ culture material could be used as sources of virus 9 not only was cpe available for reading of neutralization tests but also the oc38 and oc43 viruses were found to hemadsorb red cells of rats and mice making available a more precise means of evaluating endpoints in tests involving these organ culture-derived strains 14 the other oc strains and b814 that could not be adapted to mouse brain resisted adaptation to cell culture as well these distinct viruses have since been lost and may actually have been rediscovered recentlywork on the coronaviruses of humans proceeded slowly with debate about how frequently the viruses caused lower rather than upper respiratory disease the methodological problems of working with them were a major impediment as was their apparent involvement only in a relatively mild disease all this changed when in 2002 sars appeared first in china and then in other countries of the world the near panic resulted because of its transmission characteristics case fatality and the fact that the agent was initially unknown that last aspect was solved quickly with the identification of the causative agent as a new coronavirus the knowledge that the virus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir spurred investigation of its possible source small mammals civet cats in live game-animal markets in guangdong were identified carrying closely related viruses this led to the identification of these animals as amplifier hosts and to the game-animal wet markets as an interface where zoonotic infection of humans was being initiated 15 the natural reservoir was later identified to be chinese horseshoe bats 16 17 the sars epidemic ended following the use of various population control measures and unexpectedly has not recurred however increased attention to the coronaviruses continued globally new coronaviruses were identified in various animal hosts and two additional coronaviruses were identified in humans the first since 229e and oc43 nl63 was identified in amsterdam in 2004 from a 7-month-old child with febrile bronchiolitis 18 the same virus was also isolated at almost the same time by the group in rotterdam from an 8-month-old child with pneumonia 19 the second virus hku1 was detected in a specimen collected from a 71-year-old man from china with pneumonia and then from another adult with the same diagnosis 20 with the development of real-time pcr techniques for all four human respiratory coronaviruses it has now become possible to identify them in many situations such identification is now typically done not only for these viruses but also for a variety of other respiratory agents this has meant that coronaviruses are now detected as much in clinical settings as in epidemiologic studiesuntil the occurrence of sars coronaviruses of humans were not thought to cause death except possibly in those with underlying conditions this was in contrast to the situation in animals where infections were sometimes fatal depending on the particular virus since the sars episode the major change which has affected data on the respiratory coronaviruses has been more ready detection using the polymerase chain reaction pcr technique so that infections are now recognized in those who might previously have not been studied this has especially been the case in hospitalized individuals particularly those who will likely experience severe outcomes such as the immunocompromised it is also known from earlier studies that coronavirus frequently infects small children and reinfects adults including persons with chronic respiratory disease 21 it would be logical to assume that deaths could occur in these most susceptible segments of the population but they are probably not very frequenta problem during sars was in defining the specificity of infection whether inapparent mild or fatal this was related to the lack of a readily available diagnostic test in many areas where outbreaks occurred to a large extent cases were classified using a clinical case definition in some cases that survived there was an attempt at serological confirmationsince the coronaviruses of humans other than the sars virus usually produce illnesses indistinguishable from those caused by other respiratory viruses it is not possible to define morbidity in the absence of laboratory identification before pcr became available it was difficult directly to identify the infecting virus thus besides anecdotal reports most of the epidemiologic studies were based on identifying rises in antibody titer in contrast since development of the pcr technique direct identification has become relatively simple however this seeming advance has often been accompanied by the use of the method to determine the incidence of infection in population groups and to define characteristics of associated disease or even seasonality the major problem is the short duration of many of the available studies and the concentration on hospitalized individuals as a result while it is possible to say these viruses can sometimes cause hospitalization and to infer the particular clinical diagnoses they produce it is difficult to estimate what proportion of overall illnesses are severe a small number of studies have been population based and have produced the only data available for determining the overall impact of illness 2224 while the older population-based studies were limited to 229e oc43 or both they are useful since there are few recent investigations that give the same information they were conducted in different settings but in some cases contemporaneously which allows direct comparison in fact almost no studies include all four recognized coronaviruses and cover more than a single year this makes it difficult to discuss year-to-year variation in frequency of activity as well as seasonality as was possible with the older data such studies are therefore of continuing interest at least as background in determining the long-term occurrence of the viruses these original investigations were typically broadly based with coronavirus infection forming part of overall evaluations of the role of viruses in general in respiratory illnesses as indicated in the selected listing in table 101 a variety of different open and closed populations were used for these studies the 229e strain was originally isolated from medical students in chicago as part of a long-term study of respiratory illnesses in young adults 7 25 employee groups were the source of specimens in the nih 26 27 and in the studies at charlottesville virginia 30 infection was also evaluated in childrens homes 28 and boarding schools 5 among military recruits 34 and among children hospitalized for severe respiratory illnesses in various parts of the world 26 serological methods were used to detect occurrence in persons with acute exacerbations of asthma 33 or chronic obstructive respiratory disease 21 patterns of coronavirus infection were identified among the general population residing in the tecumseh michigan community as part of a longitudinal study of respiratory illness 31 32 also included in table 101 are more recent studies using pcr to identify infection the previous studies based on serology often did not characterize infections identified clinically in fact challenge studies of volunteers were employed early to determine characteristics of illnesses because of problems associated with direct isolation 35 36 the more recent studies were able to characterize the illnesses clinically but have other limitations as indicated above
relatively simple serological technique was available for the first two coronaviruses identified 229e and oc43 and surveys of antibody prevalence were carried out in various parts of the world many surveys formed a part of studies directed mainly toward determination of incidence of infection information on the prevalence of antibody was available for populations in the united states 27 30 31 the united kingdom 36 brazil 37 and other parts of the world a special situation was determining the meaning of the presence in man of antibody against coronaviruses of animals the finding of mouse hepatitis antibodies in military recruits and in children and adults from the general population was surprising when first described in 1964 38 it is now recognized that this did not indicate past experience with mhv but rather with human coronavirus strains known to cross-react with it similarly antibodies in human sera against the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine and the coronavirus of calf diarrhea also appear to represent cross-reactions with oc43 or related strains 29 39 in contrast in a survey of antibodies to avian ibv none could be found in a military population low-level antibodies were detected only in a portion of subjects who had close contact with poultry 40 the virus is not known to cross-react with the human strains more recently following a gap in active work on the epidemiology of coronaviruses elisa methods have been developed for at least some of the viruses 41 42 these have not been as much used as the older techniques given the availability of pcr and may not be as specific to the particular strainlaboratory diagnosis can be achieved by identification of the virus in clinical specimens using virus isolation or antigen or molecular detection techniques identification of infection can also be accomplished by detecting a host antibody response relevant specimens for virus detection are typically respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal aspirates washes or swabs nose or throat swabs and when available endotracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavages in the case of sars in which disseminated infection may occur viral rna could also readily be detected in the feces and in the serum or plasmaalthough pcr-based methods are becoming the gold standard in diagnosis virus isolation is indispensable for characterizing virus studying pathogenesis determining susceptibility to antivirals and developing novel antivirals and vaccines the human coronavirus 229e was originally isolated in cell culture and later adapted to roller culture monolayers of human embryonic lung fibroblast cells such as wi-38 and mrc-5 a cytopathic effect of small granular round cells appears at the periphery of the cell monolayer 7 although these cells can be used for the cell-adapted prototype 229e virus strain primary isolation of new 229e-like agents remains difficult the human embryonic intestine ma177 semicontinuous cell line has been used for the primary isolation of other 229e-like viruses 26 human coronaviruses oc38 and oc43 not related to 229e were originally isolated in organ cultures of human trachea or lung 6 8 43 44 these two strains are similar and have been further adapted to replicate in suckling mouse brain and to primary monkey kidney and bs-c-1 cell cultures 9 12 14 another cell system li32 a heteroploid human lung line has been reported to be suitable for primary isolation of 229e a related virus lp and the b814 the first-described organ culture agent 45 46 this last finding has not been confirmed by other workers 9 similarly mrc-c cells have been used for 229e-like viruses and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells for propagating 229e and oc43 47 48human coronavirus nl63 was initially isolated in african green monkey kidney cells llc-mk2 18 human colon carcinoma cells caco-2 have recently been shown to be more susceptible to nl63 infection and show more prominent cytopathic effect 49 hku1 was initially discovered in 2005 by broad-range primers designed to detect all known coronaviruses rather than being specific for known coronavirus types reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr 20 and new isolates remain difficult to grow reproducibly in the laboratory however it has been successfully cultured in human ciliated airway epithelial cells hae 50sars-cov was initially isolated in 2003 on african green monkey kidney epithelial cells veroe6 and in fetal rhesus kidney cells 51 52 during the sars epidemic in 2003 veroe6 cells which are deficient in interferon induction continue to be the cells of choice for culturing sars-cov at present following isolation of this novel agent electron microscopy and molecular methods random primer pcr and virus detection arrays followed by partial genetic sequencing led to its identification as novel coronavirusrecently mers a novel human coronavirus of the betacoronavirus lineage c has been detected in patients from middle eastern countries with severe pneumonia and renal dysfunction vero and veroe6 cells are suitable for primary isolation of this virus from clinical specimens 53continuous transformed cell lines do not mimic the physiological state of cells in tissues in vivo and this may be the reason why many coronaviruses are difficult to culture in vitro the use of primary cells from the relevant species cells differentiated in vitro in airliquid interface cultures and ex vivo organ cultures as was used in the early days of virology may be needed for the isolation of more fastidious viruses since some animal viruses are more readily isolated in culture although they are species-specific in their in vitro growth characteristics especially on primary isolation 5457 embryonated egg culture has been used as a host system for avian coronaviruses 58 however none of the plethora of bat coronaviruses detected by rt-pcr have been readily cultured in vitro to date even in primary bat epithelial cell lines 59immunofluorescence tests on cells from the respiratory tract eg nasopharyngeal aspirates or swab using commercially available reagents 60 or polyclonal 61 or monoclonal antibodies to 229e and hku1 62 63 have been reported but these are not widely used such antigen detection tests can also be used for the diagnosis of sars-cov infection 62 several elisa systems have been developed to detect coronaviruses including coronavirus 229e 64 and the nucleocapsid n or spike s proteins of sars-cov in respiratory samples 65 66since the majority of human coronaviruses cannot be readily cultured in vitro reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr and real-time quantitative rt-pcr have become the methods of choice for detecting and quantifying coronaviruses in clinical samples and for discovering novel viruses rt-pcr methods were used for the detection of 229e and oc43 viruses in clinical specimens 67 there are now a number of commercial assays that detect a range of respiratory pathogens including coronaviruses by the use of a combination of pcr amplification together with nucleic acid hybridization in luminex bead assay formats these methods provide the opportunity for the rapid detection of a panel of over 15 respiratory viruses including a number of coronaviruses in a clinical specimen however the sensitivity is generally less than that provided by individual rt-pcr methods 68 69apart from detection of known coronaviruses rt-pcr is useful in virus discovery and further characterization this includes a wide range of coronaviruses in bats detected solely by such broad-range rt-pcr methods because these viruses cannot at present be cultured 70 for example the first identification of hku-1 as a cause of human disease was initially based on detection of viral rna in clinical specimens by broad-range rt-pcr with primers designed to detect all viruses within the coronavirus family 20 nl63 was discovered using the vidisca virus-discovery-cdna-amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism method 18 amplified sequences from rt-pcr permit viral genome sequence analysis which sheds light on virus structure characteristics biological properties phylogeny host and tissue tropism epidemiology cross-species transmission and drug design 53 7175the demonstration of rising antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera to a specific viral antigen provides evidence of recent infection while the detection of antibody in seroepidemiologic surveys provides evidence of past infection methods that can be used for serodiagnosis have included the complement fixation test neutralization test indirect immunofluorescent if assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa hemagglutination-inhibition hi and gel-diffusion tests are less frequently used nowadaysneutralization test can also be used on coronaviruses that only grow in organ cultures 8 neutralizing antibodies could be detected as early as 510 days after symptom onset during sars infection 76 the seroprevalence for sars-cov in asymptomatic children and adults living in high- and low-risk regions in hong kong in 2003 showed that subclinical infection was rare 77 78 pseudotyped virus expressing the sars spike protein can also be used for detecting neutralizing antibody to sars-cov without the need for handling the live sars-cov which has to be carried out in bsl-3 containment 79indirect immunofluorescence tests use virus-infected cells fixed to inactivate virus infectivity as the solid-phase antigen to bind antibody in serum specimens anti-sars-cov antibodies present in the serum would bind to the viral antigens expressed on the infected veroe6 cells these primary antibodies could then be detected by adding secondary antihuman antibodies labeled with fitc 80 igm subclass antibodies to sars-cov though declining in titer can be detectable for more than 6 months after onset of disease there is less of a decline in titers of igg antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to the virus such assays can also be adapted to detect low- and high-avidity igg antibodies both for discriminating early from late antibody responses and for distinguishing anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses from primary specific responses this may be useful in some clinical situations 81elisa assays have been also developed for detecting antibodies to coronaviruses 82 83 and have been used to investigate the epidemiology of coronavirus infections 84 the elicited antibodies detected by elisa predominantly react with the viral surface proteins rather than the ribonucleoprotein 85 and infections of 229e- and oc43-like viruses can be distinguished in elisa assays 86 elisa has been used to study the seroprevalence of hku1 showing an increase from 0  in age 10 years old to a plateau of 216  in the age group of 3140 years old 87 recombinant protein-based elisa assays for detecting antibody to sars-cov have been developed 88 89 the duration of antibodies by elisa to the sars-cov spike protein was long-lived and paralleled neutralizing antibody responses while those to the nucleoprotein was less long-lived 90a protein-based line immunoassay which individually detects antibody to hcov 229e nl63 oc43 hku-1 and sars-cov nucleocapsid protein has been evaluated 91 paired sera from confirmed oc43 or 229e infections and 49 convalescent sera from sars patients showed that there was considerable cross-reactivity between the two betacoronaviruses oc43 and hku1 and between the two alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 however 229e- or oc43-infected patients did not develop cross-reactive antibody to sars-cov it is important to keep in mind such cross-reactions when evaluating the results of serological assays it is also relevant that immunofluorescent assays appear to manifest the greatest cross-reactivity neutralization tests are likely to be the most specific although this has not been systematically studied with the recently discovered coronaviruseshistorically cf or hi tests were used in epidemiologic studies of coronaviruses 7 by this method the cf test detected antibody in low titer and for only a short time after infection however if the antigen was highly concentrated antibody could be detected at a higher titer and this antibody persisted in the population so that the cf method could be employed in surveys of prevalence 92 an indirect hi test for 229e virus using tanned sheep erythrocytes has been described which appears to be highly sensitive with no cross-reactions with oc43 virus 93 cf tests can be satisfactorily performed with oc43 virus using infected suckling mouse brain as antigen 27 the same mouse brain material can also be used in the hi test for oc43 antibody in this test the hemagglutination titer has been higher for rat than for chicken erythrocytes but sufficient with the chicken cells so that hi testing could generally be employed this is of particular importance in view of the wider availability of chicken erythrocytes and the spontaneous agglutination that often complicates working with rat erythrocytes serum to be tested did not require treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme but rather standard heat inactivation at 56 c the agglutination took place equally at various temperatures including room temperature 94 it has also been possible to demonstrate precipitin lines on gel-diffusion tests with coronavirus antigens concentrated 10- to 50-fold two or three precipitin lines were observed by bradburne 92 in tests with hyperimmune animal or human serum but others have identified only one such line 94the neutralization cf hi gel-diffusion and immunofluorescent techniques have been used in the antigenic analyses of the older strains of 229e and oc43 36 95 cross-reactive antibody responses among hcovs have been reported when sera from individuals experimentally infected with 229e- and oc43-like coronaviruses including organ culture viruses were tested they are found to cross-react within each group but not across groups thus it is possible that the elisa test with 229e and oc43 antigens may be able to detect infection with most if not all human 229e and oc43 coronaviruses 86 however persons with antibody to 229e and oc43 most of the adult population did not have cross-reacting antibody to sars-cov even in immunofluorescent tests allowing these serological tests to be reliably used for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of sars patients who had oc43 infections without prior exposure to sars-cov had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting oc43 virus but not to sars-cov however antibody responses to sars-cov antibody were sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting igg antibody titers for human coronaviruses oc43 229e and nl63 by immunofluorescent assays this probably reflects anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses to coronaviruses to which the patient has had prior exposure ie similar to the concept of original antigenic sin 96 97 the cross-reactivity is less when purifying nucleocapsid proteins are used in elisa or western blot assaysall human coronaviruses hcovs are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses and belong to the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae order nidovirales the subfamily coronavirinae is further divided into three genera alpha- beta- and gammacoronaviruses corresponding to the previous informal classification groups i ii and iii respectively there is also a recently recognized deltacoronavirus genus 98 99 fig 101 the genus betacoronavirus consists of four separate lineages designated from a to d which correspond to the former subgroup 2a to d as viruses sharing more than 90  amino acid aa sequence identity in the conserved replicase pp1ab domain are treated as the same species oc43 and human enteric coronavirus hecv are thus now regarded as one species betacoronavirus 1

at present only members of alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans they differ from each other in nsp1 protein which is distinct in size and sequence gammacoronaviruses have no nsp1 in addition alphacoronaviruses commonly share an accessory gene designated as orf3 the type species for alpha- and betacoronaviruses are alphacoronavirus 1 equivalent to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev in older literature and murine coronavirus equivalent to mouse hepatitis virus mhv respectively the viruses that are human pathogens are the alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 the betacoronavirus lineage a viruses betacoronavirus 1 which comprises oc43 and human enteric coronavirus which are now regarded as variants of the same species and hku1 and the betacoronavirus lineage b virus sars-related coronavirus 98 recently mers middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus a novel human coronavirus in lineage c has been isolated phylogenetically it is closely related to bat viruses previously detected in china and in europe 53the name coronavirus comes from its appearance under the electron microscope with large 20 nm petal-shaped surface projections spikes on a 120160 nm spherical or pleomorphic body resembling a solar corona 100 fig 102 lineage a betacoronaviruses display an additional surface projection the 57 nm homodimeric hemagglutinin-esterase he glycoprotein the interior ribonucleoprotein looks like either a long strand with 12 nm diameter or a helix condensed into coiled structures with 1020 nm diameter the virions are sensitive to heat lipid solvents nonionic detergents formaldehyde oxidizing agents and uv irradiation 98

the genome of coronaviruses consists of a linear positive single-stranded rna between 26 and 32 kilobases and is the largest rna virus genome to cause infection in humans 101 the infectious genome has multiple open reading frames orfs six of which are conserved across the subfamily and are arranged in 53order as orf1a and 1b which encode for two huge polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and the orfs for structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n the two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from orf1ab are autoproteolytically cleaved into about 16 nonstructural proteins nsp which subsequently form into the replicase between the structural proteins s m e and n lies the orfs coding for the accessory proteins whose function is not essential for virus replication in vitro and the functions of many of them in vivo are still unknownas a positive-sense rna genome genome of coronaviruses serves as template for both replication and viral protein synthesis following entry into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and uncoating of the virus genome orf1ab of the genome is first translated to generate replicase proteins these replicases use the positive viral genome as the template to generate full-length negative-sense rnas which in turn serve as templates for generating additional full-length genomes ie replication in viral protein synthesis the 3 proximal genes of the viral genome are first transcribed to segmented subgenomic negative-sense rnas by discontinuous minus-strand rna synthesis the process is initiated at the 3 end of the genome and proceeds until they encounter one of the transcriptional regulatory sequences trs that reside upstream 5 of most orfs through base-pairing interactions the nascent transcript is transferred to the complementary leader trs and transcription continues through the 5 end of the genome therefore all mrnas of a coronavirus characteristically contain a common 5 leader sequence fused to a downstream gene sequence these subgenomic rnas then serve as templates for positive-sense mrna production and subsequent translation into viral proteins 101three structural proteins s e and m are found on the viral lipid-membrane envelope these are acquired as the virus buds into the endoplasmic reticulum intermediate compartment andor golgi complex of the host cell 98 the spike protein s is a large homotrimeric type i membrane glycoprotein 11281472 aa the s protein carries the receptor binding domain and is a class i fusion protein that triggers fusion between viral and host cell membranes within the endocytic vesicle thereby releasing the genome into the cytoplasm the envelope protein e is a pentameric integral membrane protein 74109 aa that acts as ion channel for preferential transport of different ions into the virion although present in low copy number in a virion e is significantly involved in virus budding morphogenesis and intracellular trafficking 102 the membrane protein m is an integral type iii triple-spanning membrane protein 218263 aa being the most abundant protein in the viral envelope it is essential in virus assembly within the infected cell it could also interfere with host immune responses by inhibiting type i interferon production 103 104 the nucleocapsid protein n is a phosphoprotein that encapsidates the rna viral genome to form ribonucleoprotein complex and regulates viral replication and translation 349470 aa it has rna chaperone activity and also functions as an interferon antagonist 105 in addition to these the group a betacoronaviruses includes oc43hecv and hku1 express an extra accessory homodimeric type i envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin esterase he on its surface it is related to subunit 1 of the influenza c virus hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein hef and mediates reversible virion attachment to o-acetylated sialic acids 106the frequency of 229e illness and infection was determined in several long-term investigations the activity of 229e was found to be high in three out of 6 years of a study among chicago medical students the mean annual incidence of infection during the total period was 15  where the criterion for identification was a reproducible twofold seroconversion determined by cf there was marked year-to-year variation in infection frequency ranging from a high of 35  of those tested in 19661967 to a low of 1  in 19641965 however nearly 97  of the infections occurred during the months from january to may often at a time when isolation of rhinoviruses was at a low and seroconversions for 229e were only rarely accompanied by a rise in titer against another respiratory agent 25the serological study of 229e activity in the community of tecumseh michigan initially covered 2 years which included one period of high prevalence as with the study in chicago routine blood specimens were collected so that infection rates could be determined however the study group was composed of individuals of all ages living in their homes over the 2 years infections were detected in 77  of individuals tested by cf as shown in the curve in fig 103 however this appeared to be an underestimate of the actual activity of the virus serum specimens had been collected on a regular basis 6 months apart rises in titer by cf occurred most frequently in those pairs in which the second specimen was collected in april 1967 clearly indicating the peak period of viral dissemination both cf and the more sensitive n test results were combined to give an overall infection rate for the population studied this rate 34  was remarkably similar to the 35  observed in chicago at the same time because of the limited period of viral activity it was possible to compare illness rates of those infected with persons not infected matched by age and sex it was estimated that 45  of the infections had produced clinical disease thus the rate of 229e-associated illnesses during the outbreak was 15 per 100 persons studied activity in all age groups was apparent including those under 25 years of age 31

in other investigations of 229e activity attention has been directed mainly toward study of associated illnesses in such studies sera have been collected before and after the illness rather than continually on a routine basis as done to determine infection rates employees at state farm insurance company in charlottesville virginia were studied during an 8-year period for rises in titer for both 229e and oc43 by cf 229e infection could be related to 3  of the colds that occurred in the winterspring and to 04  of colds that occurred in the summerfall there was some year-to-year variation in activity but differences in the number of specimens tested from various years did not permit complete identification of cyclical patterns 30 employees of the nih with respiratory illness were studied by both isolation and serology for 229e infection over a 6-year period again attention was specifically directed toward certain segments of the 6 years and no specimens were tested during other segments of particular interest once more is the segment from december 1966 to april 1967 isolation of rhinoviruses and myxoviruses was uncommon at this time but respiratory illness continued to occur during this period 24  of those persons with colds studied had rises in titer for 229e as part of the same investigation paired blood specimens collected from infants and children admitted to the hospital with acute lower respiratory disease during the 1967 period of 229e activity were tested for rise in antibody against the virus but none was found 26 27 healthy children institutionalized in atlanta georgia were studied from 1960 to 1968 antibody response to 229e was determined by the indirect hemagglutination test the investigation involved collection of serum specimens related to illness and also routine collection of sera from some non-ill individuals frequency of infection showed marked variation from year to year overall 4  of colds could be associated with 229e infection with greatest association in autumn winter and spring 28 a more recent study took advantage of specimens sent from medical facilities in edinburgh scotland for laboratory identification of infection to study the incidence of a number of respiratory viruses identified by pcr overall 229e was found in only 03  of those sampled lowest of any of the four coronaviruses studied this may reflect that the source of the specimens was from illnesses seen in hospitals and primary care facilities and coronaviruses are mainly involved in milder illnesses 22surveys of prevalence of 229e antibody have been carried out to document past history of infection often as parts of longitudinal studies a general finding is that antibody is present in a significant portion of adults who despite possessing this antibody can subsequently experience reinfection and illness reports of antibody prevalence in adults in the united states have varied from 19 to 41  depending on the type of test used to determine antibody and the time of collection of serum 27 30 110 children under 10 years of age exhibited lower mean antibody titers than older children or adults 27 31 individual sera from normal healthy adults collected serially in britain from 1965 to 1970 were tested by bradburne and somerset it is of interest that the proportion of sera positive by cf increased from approximately 17  in specimens collected in octoberdecember 1966 to 62  in those collected in julyseptember 1967 this suggests that the spring 1967 outbreak that occurred in several parts of the united states may have taken place in britain as wellpopulations employed to study infection and illness caused by oc43 virus were generally been the same ones employed to study the occurrence of 229e virus kaye et al 107 used the group of institutionalized children in atlanta georgia to identify infection by means of their hi test infections with the agent were detected in all years of the study but with definite cyclical variation seasons most involved were the winter and spring overall 3  of the illnesses recorded in the 7-year period could be associated with oc43 infection with a high of 7  in 19601961 interestingly testing of the sera collected routinely from non-ill individuals indicated that an additional equal number of oc43 infections were occurring without the production of symptoms 107 the charlottesville study of adult employees was of both oc43 and 229e infections here too the emphasis was on illness and in all years studied oc43 was associated with 5  of colds in the winterspring and with no illnesses in the summerfall again there was cyclical variation from year to year in the number of rises in titer detected 30the original isolations of oc38 and oc43 were made in december and january 19651966 as part of the study carried out among nih employees with colds testing of sera collected from these employees indicated that during this period up to 29  of the colds studied were accompanied by rise in titer for oc43 in the children hospitalized with lower respiratory disease up to 10  of illnesses during this period were associated with such a titer rise however it was impossible to show that the relationship to disease was truly etiologic this finding was in contrast to that seen with 229e in which no rises in titer were detected in such cases 27 111 in the tecumseh study occurrence of oc43 infection was determined in the community population over a 4-year period cf and hi tests were used on all specimens and n tests were used as an aid in evaluating these results in selected specimens during the total period oc43-related infection was detected in 171  of the 910 persons studied for 1 year most of the infections took place in the winterspring months of 19651966 19671968 and 19681969 the only winterspring period without such activity was in 19661967 when the 229e outbreak had taken place the 19681969 outbreak of oc43 infection was nearly as widespread as the prior 229e outbreak with 256  of the population studied showing evidence of infection of special note was the fact that children under 5 years of age had the highest infection rates 32 112 more recently in the edinburgh study involving medical care oc43 was the most commonly identified coronavirus but only was identified by pcr in 085  of specimens this again may be a reflection of the source of the specimens surveys of antibody prevalence have been conducted in several settings using oc43 antigens mcintosh et al 27 found that children began to acquire antibody to this virus in the first year of life by the third year of life more than 50  had antibody present among adults 69  could be demonstrated to have antibody this indicates in view of the high incidence of infection with the agents in all age groups the frequency with which such infections must represent reinfection the high prevalence of antibody has been confirmed in other studies 28 30 112 in britain bradburne and somerset followed prevalence of antibody for oc43 over time as they also had done with 229e 36 each year the greatest prevalence of antibody was found in the winterspring period the single highest point in antibody prevalence was in januarymarch 1969 at the same time the oc43 outbreak was occurring in some parts of the united states 30 38occurrence of coronavirus infection has now been documented by isolation pcr or serology throughout the world in earlier studies in the united states in addition to the studies listed in the first part of table 101 a 229e-like virus was isolated in california and oc43 and 229e have been demonstrated to be present in many regions of the country 21 113 extensive studies have been carried out by the common cold research unit which have demonstrated the presence of the agents in britain the activity of 229e virus has been documented in brazil in an early study of children and adults with and without respiratory illness significant rises in antibody titer accompanied respiratory infection in the nonhospitalized children prevalence of antibody was determined by cf and like the situation in some studies in the north temperate zone children had little antibody whereas 26  of adults were antibody positive 37 later investigations have confirmed the worldwide distribution of these agents 112 114 in particular the widespread use of pcr has now allowed easy documentation of the activity of all the coronaviruses in fact one of the four viruses now recognized hku1 was first identified in the subtropical city of hong kong 20 these findings suggest that coronaviruses are worldwide in distribution and cause similar types of illness in different localities 115 as has been noted with many other respiratory viruses 116 117the newly recognized human mers coronavirus infections have only occurred in middle eastern countries jordan qatar saudi arabia the united arab emirates with limited secondary transmission being reported in france italy tunisia and the united kingdom the infection is probably of zoonotic origin although other scenarios cannot be completely excluded at present persons with immunosuppressive conditions and other underlying diseases appear to be particularly susceptible to infection while there have been significant clusters of infection in some health-care facilities mers coronavirus appears to have limited capacity for human-to-human spread at present 118120because most illnesses caused by coronaviruses are similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses it is impossible to identify epidemic behavior of the viruses clinically in early epidemiologic studies there was however evidence of variation in the frequency of infection on both a seasonal and a cyclical basis in these investigations isolation and rises in antibody titer for all types of coronaviruses were rare events outside the period from december through may this is the portion of the year in which isolation rates for rhinoviruses often reach their lowest level an exception to this rule was a study in which frequent rises in titer were detected by elisa in summer as well 84 more recent studies identifying the viruses by pcr have largely confirmed the winter seasonality of the viruses in the north temperate zone one study observed that the timing of coronavirus identifications was similar to that of influenza in winterearly spring 22 as expected the seasonality appears to differ in places like hong kong based on accumulating data 121in the earlier multiyear population-based studies a cyclical pattern could also be seen in the occurrence of individual virus types in fig 104 data are summarized from five longitudinal studies of coronavirus activity carried out in different parts of the united states in all studies some sporadic activity did occur in nearly all years studied but rises in antibody titers were concentrated in certain years in which they far exceeded the means for the entire studies those periods are indicated as solid black boxes in the figure the times during which specimens were collected in each investigation are indicated in the figure by the white boxes activity of 229e was detected in all four studies at the same time even though two were in the midwest and two in the eastern united states it seems possible on the basis of these data to postulate a 2- to 3-year cycle for this agent the greatest number of infections in chicago was seen in 1967 after the absence of the agent for 3 years that pattern suggests a role of herd immunity in determining the time of reappearance of the agent

with oc43 the situation is quite different as with 229e in no investigation did 2 years with high rates of infection or illness follow one another a possible exception was in the tecumseh study however the agent that caused the rises in titer in 19671968 did not appear as closely related serologically to oc43 as the agent involved in the other two outbreaks this observation indicates a problem in identifying cycling of oc43 using the serological test employedmore recent studies using pcr have mainly not been population based or have focused on a limited number of the four known respiratory coronaviruses so that comparable observations across all of the viruses are not possible however it is possible to conclude that in any winter season all four viruses may be identified in a single geographic area 122 123 there are likely to be increases of one or more in specific years but it is unlikely that any coronavirus disappears completely this is somewhat similar to our growing realization with better surveillance of the long-term occurrence of influenza types and subtypes 22there is little available evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses behave differently than other respiratory viruses infections are most common in children and decrease with increasing age however it is unclear whether the drop-off is modest or more extreme as is the case with respiratory syncytial virus 124 in the tecumseh study a total population group was followed during the 19681969 oc43 outbreak infection rates were relatively uniform for all age groups varying from a high of 292 per 100 person-years in the 04 age group to 222 in those over 40 years of age 32 the reversal of the pattern of age-specific infection rates customarily associated with the respiratory viruses becomes complete with 229e infection with this virus has been more difficult to demonstrate in small children than in adults in tecumseh during the 19661967 outbreak highest age-specific infection rates by cf were found among those 1529 years of age following a steady increase in infection frequency from the 0- to 4-year-olds however when neutralization tests were used to detect infection the 15- to 19-year-olds still had high infection rates but the serial increase to that point among younger age groups was much less steep 31 this suggests that the apparent sparing of small children with 229e may be an artifact resulting from the relative insensitivity of the young to the serological procedures commonly employed it would be surprising if two different coronavirus serotypes behaved so differently 125there is little evidence for or against a sex differential in infections with the coronaviruses in tecumseh adult females experienced higher infection rates with oc43 than adult males which is in conformity with the usual patterns of all respiratory illnesses 126 similarly female volunteers appeared to be more susceptible to infection with 229e-like strains than males in artificial challenge studies 127 in the study by candeias et al of antibody prevalence the results were examined by sex but no significant differences could be observed 43 there are no data available on occupational or racial susceptibility to infection or on the role of socioeconomic status in influencing rates occurrence of infection in closed or special populations such as military recruits or residents of childrens institutions has been reported 5 26 34 the role of the school-age child in dissemination of coronavirus has not yet been clearly defined but it would be surprising if these infections differed in their transmission pattern so markedly from that documented with the other agents because of the high frequency of infection in older children and adults other sites of dissemination may also be of significance it has been possible to show that the family unit is of importance in transmission since clustering of 229e and oc43 infections in families was observed in the tecumseh and seattle studies 31 128although nutritional and genetic factors have not been associated with susceptibility to coronavirus infections there are clear indications that the viruses are associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive respiratory disease such a finding is hardly surprising in view of the high infection rates that have been observed in unselected older adults 129 it has not yet been demonstrated whether this represents true increased susceptibility to infection or simply a more severe form of expression of the infection when it occurs in an already compromised host in addition to the situation in older individuals there is evidence that both oc43 and 229e may trigger acute attacks of wheezing in young asthmatics in fact in one study coronaviruses were the most common agent involved in episodes of wheezy bronchitis 21 33 117 130 recent studies using the pcr technique also associate the viruses with illnesses including pneumonia in immunocompromised patients 63 115 131 one study identified all the viruses over the course of a year but the newer viruses nl63 and hku1 most commonly again this may be a reflection of these viruses being most common at that point in time it should be noted that shortly after the first identification of nl63 in one city in the netherlands it was again identified in another which may indicate increased circulation at the time 18 132in total 8096 probable sars cases were reported to the world health organization by august 2003 138 the most affected areas were hong kong with 1755 probable cases among a population of 68 million and mainland china with 5327 probable cases among a population of 13 billion taiwan canada and singapore also experienced notable epidemics with 346 251 and 238 probable cases respectively while altogether cases were reported in more than 25 different countries and administrative regions reported cases of sars globally and in hong kong by time of symptom onset are shown in fig 105

a common feature of sars outbreaks in different regions was the central role of hospitals and transmission among patients and health-care workers 139143 a peak in infectiousness was thought to occur around 10 days after illness onset 144 by which time cases would have been hospitalized and certain medical procedures were particularly prone to generating transmission 145 hospital transmission played a prominent role in the initial epidemic in hong kong with more than 250 cases attributed to an outbreak at the prince of wales hospital in early march 2003 146 147 the canadian outbreak began when a case returning from hong kong was admitted to hospital and 72  of cases were subsequently attributed to nosocomial transmission 143 148old age and the presence of comorbidities including diabetes mellitus hypertension coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased the risk of death or adverse outcomes such as admission to an icu requiring mechanical ventilation and development of ards 149 150 sex male high lactate dehydrogenase concentration at presentation and higher sars-cov viral load have been found contributing to higher case fatality rate as well 151 genetic factors may contribute to host susceptibility to sars infection 78 152 153 to date there have been no studies on the relationship of race socioeconomic status occupation or nutrition to susceptibility to sars infectionconcerted efforts were made during the sars epidemic to determine the transmission dynamics and thereby support control 154 155 contact tracing exercises provided information to estimate the incubation period at around 5 days with around 95  of infections leading to illness onset within 1014 days 156158 early in the epidemic delays between illness onset and admission to hospital were typically 57 days and a measure of the success of public health control measures was the reduction in onset-admission intervals to just 12 days by the end of the epidemic 150 157 on average patients remained in hospital for around 34 weeks 157the basic reproductive number r0 an estimate of the average number of secondary cases resulting from one infected case in a completely susceptible population was estimated to be in the range 23 154 155 159 the average time between successive cases was around 84 days 155 due to these features taken together in the early stages of outbreaks the number of cases approximately doubled every weekone issue of early controversy was the case fatality risk early in the epidemic technical errors led to underestimation 160 for example on march 25 the world health organization reported the case fatality risk to be around 4  based on 49 deaths among more than 1000 cases at that time 161 this estimate was erroneously low because cases had not yet recovered and some cases would subsequently succumb to the disease 160 after the epidemic the case fatality risk was estimated to be 96  with 744 deaths among the 8096 probable cases 135 however this masks substantial variability between affected regions from around 7  in beijing to around 17  in hong kong 150 reasons for variation remain unclear but could partly be attributed to case definitions partly to case mix including age and underlying heath conditions 150 and partly to case management 162few cases are thought to have been asymptomatic or subclinical serological studies were conducted in various groups including health-care workers close contacts of cases other patients and the general community in affected regions and a review of these studies found that the average seropositivity rate was just 01  among more than 20000 individuals 163despite a basic reproductive number in the range 23 higher than influenza the global epidemic of sars was effectively controlled by appropriate nosocomial infection control measures a range of interventions contributed to containment 164 including the use of engineering controls such as negative-pressure isolation rooms 143 improved adherence to the use of personal protective equipment such as gowns gloves and masks 165 as well as administrative measures including patient triaging and isolation visitor restrictions and establishment of dedicated sars teams of staff 166 the importance of strict infection control was illustrated particularly well by the experiences in taiwan and toronto where control of the initial outbreaks was followed by complacency and subsequent second waves 167 168 despite the importance of infection control strategies there are also examples of individuals with sars who were hospitalized where infection control practices were lax and yet their infection did not result in outbreaks 169 patient factors may also have had a role in the risk of transmission 170the four endemic respiratory coronaviruses are presumably transmitted by the respiratory route it has been possible to induce infection experimentally in volunteers by inoculating virus into the nose 35 44 the virus is most stable at ph 60 and low temperature appears to protect it against varied relative humidity 171 172 no other route of transmission for coronaviruses seems involved in man although animal coronaviruses are infectious by the fecaloral route 57 there is currently no direct evidence to aid in identifying the main mechanisms of transmission however it is possible to compare the epidemiologic behavior of the coronaviruses with that of other respiratory agents the transmission mechanisms of which have been more directly studied large-scale outbreaks of coronavirus infections have taken place as in tecumseh in 1967 31 this is much more analogous to the situation seen with influenza than to that with the rhinoviruses 173 rhinoviruses are thought to be transmitted by large droplet and may at times spread via fomites 174unlike the situation with the sars coronaviruses there is no evidence that any animal reservoir or vector is involved in the maintenance of infection or transmission of the other respiratory human coronaviruses there has been a report of antibody to avian ibv in the sera of poultry workers but not of controls but no evidence of any further transmission 40the sars coronavirus was thought to spread through a number of different modes most commonly via direct close contact health-care workers involved in direct patient care duties often had the highest attack rates 175 176 while contact precautions were effective in preventing transmission 165 sars coronavirus was capable of surviving on dried inert surfaces and was found on some hospital surfaces 177 and indirect contact was implied in the infections of some nonmedical staff 178 although there is substantial evidence to support the role of transmission through droplet and direct contact and some evidence to support transmission by indirect contact there is relatively little evidence for airborne transmission 179 in one large community outbreak in hong kong a computational fluid dynamics model was used to demonstrate that airborne transmission was consistent with the observed pattern of infections 180 although this hypothesis was not formally compared with other possible explanations however lacking other evidence of airborne transmission despite unprotected extended exposures in health-care settings 169 181 182 the world health organization classified sars as a disease with opportunistic airborne transmission to indicate that the disease naturally spreads by non-airborne routes but under special environmental conditions may spread by the airborne route 183 184 diseases that are spread by opportunistic airborne transmission do not require special airborne infection isolation measures for example negative-pressure isolation rooms but special precautions are recommended for high-risk proceduresdata that demonstrate the etiologic role of coronaviruses in respiratory infections are derived from laboratory and field studies coronaviruses interfere with the action of cilia in tracheal organ culture which suggests that they could have the same effect in vivo epidemiologic studies also have demonstrated association of 229e infection with disease during the 1967 outbreak of 229e infection in tecumseh michigan illness was significantly more common among those with infection than among matched subjects without infection 31 similarly 229e infection among chicago medical students was statistically associated with illness when those with rises in titer were used as their own controls 25 furthermore experimental inoculation of volunteers with strains of 229e and oc43 isolated in the laboratory has resulted in clinical illness fulfilling kochs postulates modified by rivers 185 for attributing an etiologic role to a microbe as a cause of disease 35 36 47sars-cov has also fulfilled the kochrivers postulates for association with the disease of sars the virus was detected in patients with sars but not in those without disease and the virus was detected at the site of the pathology that is lung 51 the virus was isolated in pure culture from the lung biopsy of a patient with sars and experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with this virus produced a comparable disease a specific immune response to the virus was demonstrated and the virus was successfully re-isolated from the site of pathology in the infected animal 186 fulfilling kochrivers postulates for more recently discovered human coronaviruses has been more challenging because of the lack of suitable animal models that recapitulate the disease in humans 187 and their etiologic association with disease lies largely on epidemiologic groundsan important characteristic of the respiratory coronaviruses is their apparent high rate of reinfection which in volunteers has now been documented to be possible within a year of prior infection 188 in the tecumseh study 815  of those infected with oc43 actually possessed prior n antibody 189 possession of circulating oc43 hi antibody among the atlanta children did not appear to play a role in modifying severity of a subsequent illness 28 with 229e virus hamre and beem 25 demonstrated that the frequency of rise in titer detected by n was inversely proportional to preinfection levels of n antibody which would indicate that this antibody exerted some protective effect however the importance of this n antibody could not be confirmed when infection was detected by cf thus circulating n antibody as measured at present may bear a relationship to modification of infection but this association is not a very strong one since coronavirus infections involve mainly the surface of the respiratory tract it is likely that secretory iga antibody plays a more direct role in protection this had in fact been demonstrated with a swine coronavirus 190 and subsequently with 229e in humans experimentally infected 191interaction between coronavirus spike proteins and host cell receptors determines specifically the host range tissue tropism and pathogenesis 192 coronaviruses have a wide spectrum of susceptible host cell range determined by the expression of the relevant receptors table 103 related coronaviruses may use the same or similar receptors for entry and major receptors for hcovs include aminopeptidase apn and ace2 most alphacoronaviruses bind to apn with the exception of nl63 and sars-cov which binds to ace2 some of the betacoronaviruses including oc43 attach to 4- or 9-o-acetylated sialic acids via the virus s and he proteins the he protein also has enzymatic activity to cleave sialic acid linkages and thus serves to release virus from infected cells after replication is completed some human coronaviruses have other binding receptors that allow virus attachment to host cells but these are not sufficient as functional receptors to mediate viral entry by themselves these include calcium-dependent c-type lectins such as l-sign liverlymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin which may serve as a receptor for 229e and sars 202 203 recognition of a receptor from the same family in another host species is possible and may allow cross-species transmission for example 229e can use either human or feline apn but not porcine apn 201 and human and palm civet ace2 serve as receptors for epidemic strains of sars-cov but mouse and rat ace2 do not 204 205
the receptor for mers coronavirus has been identified to be dpp4 also known as cd26 a protein that is widely conserved across mammalian species and found on the surface of several cell types including the human upper airways as with apn and ace2 dpp4 is an ectopeptidase that cleaves amino acids from biologically active peptides 200the human coronavirus oc43 and bovine coronaviruses share close genetic similarity suggesting that they arose from a common ancestor less than 150 years ago 206 coronaviruses can undergo dramatic changes in tissue tropism and virulence within the same host for example porcine enteric transmissible gastroenteritis virus caused a severe enteric disease in pigs a spontaneously occurring genetic mutation deletion occurring in the spike gene led to a change in virulence and was associated with a switch of virus tropism from the gastrointestinal tract to the respiratory tract 207there is limited data on the pathology of coronaviruses other than sars-cov because these infections are generally mild electron micrographic changes from the nasal mucosa of a child with a coronavirus infection showed minimal pathological changes 208although the clinically major pathology of sars was that seen in the respiratory tract sars-cov caused a disseminated infection with virus being found in the feces urine and plasma or serum 209 early disease was associated with desquamation of the alveolar epithelium and disseminated alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation in the alveolar spaces viral antigen was demonstrated in alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages 210 in intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with sars virus infection of intestinal epithelium was demonstrated by electron microscopy with minimal cytopathic effect which is consistent with the watery diarrhea seen in these patients 211 high serum levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines cxcl10 il-8 and cytokines il-1 and il-6 suggested a role for immunopathology although it is uncertain whether these inflammatory responses are causally relevant or an epiphenomenon in the pathogenesis 212the incubation period of coronavirus colds is relatively short in studies involving volunteers the mean period from inoculation of virus to development of symptoms was from 32 to 35 days depending on the strain range 24 days 35 44 following exposure the virus apparently multiplies superficially in the respiratory tract in a manner similar to that in which multiplication occurs in vitro nasal airway resistance and temperature of the nasal mucosa increase 213 virus excretion usually reaches a detectable level at the time symptoms begin and lasts for 14 days the duration of the illness is from 6 to 7 days on the average but with some lasting up to 18 days serological response either to induced or to naturally acquired infection has been quite variable depending on the infecting strain and the serological test employed for example among those experimentally infected with oc38 or oc43 virus who had a cold produced only 46  had rises in titer by hi and 23  by cf fewer than half of those infected with 229e showed a cf rise it is not clear how the existence of titer or preinfection antibody affects the magnitude of the response detected by these tests rises in n antibody titer are easier to detect and have been found with sensitive techniques in all volunteers experimentally infected 36 92 the use of the elisa test has given added sensitivity in antibody detection it is not as yet clear if decreased specificity should be a concernthe respiratory coronaviruses cause cold-like illness that on an individual basis is difficult to distinguish from illness caused by other respiratory viruses they have also been reported to cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory infections such as croup and bronchiolitis 115 123 214 most of the evidence of their involvement in severe disease comes from reports from hospitals of the identification of the viruses by pcr it is thus impossible to say what proportion of infections which appear to be common that result in hospitalization are in fact caused by these viruses another problem recently encountered is the frequent identification by pcr of other viruses in those in whom a coronavirus is found 22 this complicates determining the primary etiology in induced infections in volunteers the most prominent findings have been coryza and nasal discharge with the discharge being more profuse than that customarily seen with rhinovirus colds 35 sore throat has been somewhat less common and in children has been associated with pharyngeal injection 215 experimental colds caused by b814 virus were about as severe as those caused by 229e however natural oc43 infections caused illnesses with considerably more cough and sore throat than did 229e infections 216 the mean duration of coronavirus colds at 65 days was shorter than that seen in rhinovirus colds at 95 days 35clinical disease occurred in no more than 45  of those infected with 229e in tecumseh during the 1967 outbreak 31 in atlanta children oc43 virus produced illness in about 50  of those infected 28 it is likely that with increase in age and concomitant experience with these agents the ratio of clinically apparent to inapparent infection will decrease as with other respiratory agents a continuum of severity of symptoms exists among those in whom infection results in disease and this may also be related to past experience with the virusesthe mechanisms that lead to recovery from coronavirus infections have not been well defined in volunteer studies in persons infected with 229e-like strains it is clear that symptomatic reinfection can occur after a period of about 1 year it is not clear whether this is due to waning immunity or antigenic drift immunocompromised patients shed virus for a prolonged period and may sometimes be associated with a fatal outcomethe novel mers coronavirus initially presents with fever and myalgia sometimes with gastrointestinal symptoms rapidly progressing to severe viral pneumonia leading to respiratory failure with renal dysfunction observed in some patients virus was detectable in the respiratory tract as well as the stool 119virus-neutralizing antibodies are those that react with the virus s and where present he protein although some antibodies against the virus m protein can also neutralize the virus in the presence of complement virus-neutralizing antibodies mainly bind to the n-terminal s1 part of the protein which is also the part of the protein that manifests the greatest amino acid sequence variation the removal of glycans from the s protein greatly reduces the binding of neutralizing antibodies antibodies to the s protein have also been associated with enhanced pathogenesis in feline infectious peritonitis virus but such immunopathology has not so far been convincingly demonstrated with human coronaviruses the nucleocapsid protein contributes to cell-mediated immune protection 209neutralizing antibody responses to sars-cov appear in the second week of illness and peak at around 30 days of illness and antibodies remain detectable for many years the major neutralizing epitope is in the region of the s protein amino acid residues 441700 98 99 209it is premature at present to think in terms of control of respiratory coronavirus infection by vaccination thus preparation of vaccines using conventional types is impossible the frequency of reinfection observed is so high that control by vaccination may not be practical but it is possible that future studies may allow further characterization of truly protective antibodies work on vaccines for the animal viruses is in progress and these studies may help in understanding issues of protection chemoprophylaxis and related measures may be a more practical approach it has been shown that recombinant -interferon can prevent infections artificially produced in volunteers 217 and other approaches have been under investigation 25 217219 there remains environmental control of infection such efforts have rarely been useful for other respiratory agents but they may be more efficacious if a practical barrier to transmission can be devised 220the situation is quite different in terms of the sars-cov because of the severity of the disease produced here the work on vaccines moved forward in the years immediately after 2003 some of this activity of specific vaccine development continues but at a slower pace even when human cases were occurring it was unclear how such a vaccine if available should be used given the distribution of infection and occurrence of clinical disease with disappearance of human cases it has become even more difficult to decide on the appropriate vaccine target populations except for those who might be exposed in a laboratory settingduring the sars episode as no virus-specific antiviral agent was available a variety of treatments were used including the broad-acting antiviral agents ribavirin and interferon as well as corticosteroids because of the severity of the disease many were used in combination and it was difficult to say retrospectively whether any individually or in combination had a positive effect 162 corticosteroid therapy was associated with both short-term secondary infections increased viral load and long-term osteoporosis avascular necrosis adverse effects 221the major problem in working with the respiratory coronaviruses has been solved with the development of rt-pcr previously because of the difficulty in growing them in cell culture epidemiologic and clinical studies had to rely on serology while less limiting in epidemiologic studies where regular blood collections can be scheduled it sharply constrained the ability to identify the role of hcovs in causing severe respiratory infections now we recognize the existence of four different coronaviruses and there may be more that have not yet been identified paradoxically the situation has now been reversed there are many reports on the involvement of these agents in hospitalized cases but epidemiologic studies involving all four hcovs in different populations over time have been relatively scarce it was previously thought that the viruses cycle in their appearance over a period of years but recent evidence is lacking especially pertaining to the newly identified viruses nl63 and hku1 however there are still data suggesting that in the temperate zones the viruses are most active in late winterspring ironically with the pcr technique it has become common to identify more than one virus from the same individual this is not limited to the coronaviruses but includes many other respiratory viruses as well there is a need to determine whether these are true coinfections or whether there may be asymptomatic or prolonged carriage involved if they are real coinfections there may be consequences of having more than one agent present during an illnessthe sars-cov emerged from a zoonotic reservoir and spread worldwide in a short period of time we still do not know how and why this happened and therefore we must be concerned that such an event could occur again we do not have either vaccines or antivirals for the sars-cov the need is probably greater for antivirals given the severity of the illness and the question of how a vaccine would be used in the current situation the recent identification of a novel coronavirus gives increased urgency to this need it is likely that an anticoronavirus drug would be of use whatever the particular type involved overall the epidemiologic lesson to be learned from sars is the need for good surveillance at the animalhuman interface the virus was probably transmitting locally from human to human for months before it escaped to the rest of the world if this had been recognized there could have been earlier efforts to contain spread which was effectively accomplished later but only after much damage had been donethe emergence of a novel mers coronavirus with potential to cause severe human disease though so far originating in the middle east and manifesting limited human-to-human transmission including transmission within health-care facilities is reminiscent of the emergence of sars and is a concern for global public health 120the numbers of laboratory-confirmed patients with mers continues to increase with 837 laboratory confirmed cases and 291 deaths being reported to who as of 23 july 2014 the median age of all cases is 52 years but primary human cases those who have no exposure to other confirmed cases are older median age 58 years compared to secondary cases median age 45 years the majority of confirmed cases have underlying health conditions all cases so far have a link to the middle east with primary human infections reported from jordan kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates cases reported from outside the middle east have either a history of travel to the middle east or exposure to a patient who acquired infection from that region clusters of human cases and evidence of limited human-to-human transmission have been reported to date more than half of the secondary cases have been associated with health care settings including health care workers health care workers appear to have less severe disease in general although deaths have occasionally been reported 222mers coronavirus mers-cov has been detected in nasal swabs of apparently healthy dromedary camels and adult animals from the middle east and africa have high rates of sero-positivity 223 224 in some cases infection of dromedary camel herds has preceded disease in humans in close contact with such animals 225 however in a large number of human cases there appears to be no record of a history of contact with camels the dromedary mers-cov virus appears genetically identical to those infecting humans but abattoir workers with repeated exposure to potentially infected animals have little serological evidence of infection 223 the geographic distribution of mers-cov infection in camels including north east africa is wider than that reported in primary human cases reported so far it remains to be seen whether this represents under-recognition of human cases in a wider geographic area mers-cov antibodies have been detected in archived dromedary sera collected over two decades ago 226 and this may indicate that mers is a recently recognised rather than a newly emerging disease however the possibility of a recent virus mutation that increased the risk of transmission to humans cannot be ruled outno specific validated therapeutic options or vaccines are available so farsince the first reported case of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 zaki et al 2012 small and large outbreaks have occurred resulting in 1917 mers-cov infections and 677 related deaths to date who 2017 to understand this fatal respiratory viral infection several serologic investigations have been conducted corman et al 2016 min et al 2016 park et al 2015 payne et al 2016 however practical analysis of serodiagnostic parameters for clinical usage was limited in previous studies due to insufficient sample size or clinical information we managed 45 mers-cov-infected patients which is the largest number of patients as a single center during the 2015 korean mers outbreak total 186 patients identified cho et al 2016 kim et al 2016 park et al 2016 and reported that mers-cov-infected patients experienced 4 distinct clinical courses ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation ko et al 2016 based on these findings we evaluated serologic response of 42 mers-cov-infected patients according to the disease severity to investigate potential role of serodiagnostic parameters as prognostic markersamong 45 mers-cov-infected patients who were admitted to samsung medical center a 1950-bed tertiary care university hospital during the 2015 korean mers outbreak ko et al 2016 we obtained sera from 42 patients mers-cov infections were confirmed on the basis of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr assays targeting upstream of the e gene upe and the open-reading frame gene 1a orf1a corman et al 2012a madani 2014 epidemiologic investigation data and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain exact exposure date symptom onset clinical course and outcome data for the patients one or 2 residual serum samples per week of illness were used for serologic testing during hospitalization periods follow-up serum samples obtained at outpatient clinics were also tested up to 6 months from symptom onset the institutional review board of samsung medical center approved the present studythe clinical course of mers-cov-infected patients was assessed 6 weeks after symptom onset and patients were divided into 4 disease severity groups asymptomatic infection group 0 symptomatic infection without pneumonia group 1 pneumonia without respiratory failure group 2 and pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure group 3 ko et al 2016 for practical purposes respiratory failure was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation only patients in group 3 experienced fatal outcomes 513 385 and interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in median iqr 19355 proportion of underlying immunocompromising conditions including diabetes solid cancer or hematologic malignancies was not different between groups ko et al 2016 the distinct clinical presentation of the 4 severity groups are presented in supplementary figs 1 and 2 and supplementary table 1 in addition to the previous report ko et al 2016seroconversion status was determined based on neutralization activity if none of the serum samples from a mers-cov-infected patient necessarily including sera obtained after the third week of illness showed neutralization activity the patient was considered to have negative seroconversion if none of the serum samples obtained by the end of the third week of illness showed neutralization activity and no samples were available for neutralization tests thereafter the patient was considered to have an indeterminate response ie interpretation not applicable if any serum showed neutralization activity the patient was considered to have positive seroconversion patients with an indeterminate response were excluded from calculation of the seroconversion rate this definition is based on the premise that no patients had previous exposure to mers-cov as this was the first mers outbreak in korea as a non-endemic countryduring the outbreak mers-cov exposure dates and symptom onsets were clearly identified in most patients owing to thorough contact investigation and monitoring of exposed individuals cho et al 2016 park et al 2016 mers-related symptoms included fever myalgia cough sputum and diarrhea to provide a common point of reference we used days post onset of illness dpoi to evaluate mers-cov-infected patients for asymptomatic patients the day of diagnosis of mers-cov infection was considered as day of symptom onset ko et al 2016anti-mers-cov elisa igg and iga euroimmun lbeck germany were based on soluble

clinical variables between groups one-way analysis of variance anova or kruskal-wallis test was used for continuous variables and chi-square or fishers exact test was used for categorical variables six-week survival probability was calculated using the kaplanmeier method the cox proportional hazard model and log-rank test were used to examine the association of seroconversion status with the

  0005 by the cox proportional hazard model in predicting 6-week mortalitysince previous hospital-associated outbreaks of mers occurred in endemic countries where primary infections flow from community into hospitals detailed clinical data of each patient were hard to obtain corman et al 2016 however during the 2015 korean mers outbreak the first outbreak in a non-endemic country epidemiologic links and entire clinical course of each patients could be clearly identified ko et al 2016 park et al 2016 owing to the detailed epidemiologic and clinical information about patients we could find out different serologic response depending on disease severity and outcomealthough different seroconversion rates depending on disease severity can be inferred from previous serologic investigation min et al 2016 the number of evaluated mers patients was limited to 14 and neutralization testing was not performed in that study a robust increment of elisa igg titer with a 3-fold increase in od ratio was exclusively observed among patients with severe pneumonia while mild infections exhibited a modest increment in od ratio if any likewise we noted that asymptomatic mers-cov-infected cases did not show serologic response including prnt within 6 months and the seroconversion rate increased with the disease severity although the number of asymptomatic patients was limited to 3 in the present analysis it is less likely that asymptomatic patients will experience seroconversion considering that even group 1 patients with obvious mers-related symptoms showed low seroconversion rate of 60 this finding correlates with another serologic study that evaluated 11 rrt-pcr-confirmed mers patients choe et al 2017 in that study antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients with mild illness were undetectable in addition most contact surveys of mers-cov could not detect additional rrt-pcr-negative prnt-positive mers-cov infections breakwell et al 2015 buchholz et al 2013 choi et al 2016 ko et al 2017 these findings imply that serologic surveys to detect subclinical infections among asymptomatic individuals would not be effectiveserologic response was delayed in group 3 patients and negative seroconversion by the third week of illness was associated with fatal outcome among patients with mers pneumonia hr 2783 95 ci 27628021 p
  0005 delayed commencement of serologic response in severe disease was also suggested by previous report by park et al park et al 2015 although seroconversion timing was not statistically significantly delayed in group 3 patients in the present study delayed increment of igg iga and igm titers after the third week was demonstrated in group 3 however the delayed serologic response in group 3 could not be used as predictor for respiratory failure as respiratory failure progressed during the 2nd week of illness 12 dpoi in medianmeanwhile negative seroconversion in mers pneumonia by the third week of illness was associated with fatal outcome in the present analysis impaired serologic response in deceased patient was also noted in the paper of corman et al but insufficient clinical information especially day of symptom onset hampered more detailed analysis in association with timeline corman et al 2016 in this study we could obtain exact clinical information including day of symptom onset and figured it out that seroconversion status by the third week of illness by 21 dpoi can serve as a prognostic marker another important point is that mers-cov-infected patients in the present analysis died later than previous reports probably owing to antiviral therapy or aggressive critical care including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo the median interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in the present study which is much longer than 115 days in previous reports zumla et al 2015 although rapidly deteriorating mers cases would die before the third week of illness there certainly is a population that benefit from prognosis prediction by serologic response aggressive managements including ecmo should be considered for pneumonia patients without seroconversion by the third week of illness although seroconversion status can be confirmed by neutralization tests it cannot be readily performed worldwide corman et al 2016 in the present analysis seroconversion status of the third week assessed by elisa igg and iga was similar with that by prnt these elisa tests can be practically used for predicting poor prognosis of mers pneumonia in the field of patient managementas a retrospective study serum samples of each patient could not be collected with same interval however we applied strict criteria for seroconversion excluding patients who did not have follow-up samples after the third week of illness as indeterminate response in the previous report with the same patient population we also suggest predictive factors for disease progression using clinical variables within 3 days from symptom onset ko et al 2016 together with the present paper these factors could be used complementarily in managing mers-cov-infected patients in addition although we identified that seroconversion status by the third week was associated with fatal outcomes of mers pneumonia we could not perform multivariate analysis due to limited sample size this finding need to be further evaluated with enough patient numbers of mers pneumoniain conclusion in a serologic investigation of 42 mers-cov-infected patients mild cases showed low seroconversion rates while fatal cases showed impaired serologic responsesthis work was supported by a samsung biomedical research institute sbri grant smx1161321 cd reports funding by eu grants antigone ga no 278976 and prepare ga no 602525there are no potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article to reporta new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome called sars-cov-21 emerged in the region of wuhan mainland china in december 20192 this rapidly spreading virus most likely originated from bat to human transmission in a wet market in china and now caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease covid-193 cheng et al

here we describe early experience in a military setting in switzerland and the herein associated challenges the cases occurred in the canton of ticino which is the southernmost canton of switzerland and borders italys regions of piedmont and lombardy which are among the most heavily struck covid-19 regions in the world7 although severe disease is unlikely in the highly selected population of a recruit school8 management of logistical issues in this closed environment is highly challenging our aim is to emphasise how aggressive early management of disease can avoid general spread among the troops which can jeopardise any subsidiary engagement in supporting civil institutions and hospitalsthis is a retrospective cases series among members of the swiss armed forces maf during the covid-19 pandemic all members of the swiss armed forces provided informed consent for the studynasopharyngeal swabs from both nostrils was performed by an experienced otolaryngologist diagnosis of covid-19 was made after positive pcr for sars-cov-2 by the cantonal laboratory in bellinzona ticino switzerlandquarantine was established for persons with close contact less than 2 m for more than 15 min in the last 48 hours before onset symptom of the covid-19 positive index patientfor serological testing we used a commercially available immunochromatography rapid test with sars-cov-2 protein-specific igm and igg this test was performed according to the manufacturers instructions with a reported sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 95 respectivelyon 12 march 2020 a recruit presented at the military medical centre of monte ceneri ticino switzerland with headache dry cough and fever since the previous day his exposition and travel history were unremarkable expect for a skiing trip in the swiss alps during a permission 4 days before the patient patient 1 was isolated pcr testing from nasopharyngeal swab was positive for sars-cov-2 at the time it was the second positive case in the swiss armed forces the patient was treated symptomatically with acetaminophen and antitussive drugs quarantine was ordered for any person with a close contact with patient 1 a total of 55 mafs had to be quarantined for a total headcount of 140 of the concerned company a separate military barrack was requisitioned for the planned quarantine period of 5 days the 55 mafs were put in seven separate rooms a thermometer was provided to each room and a room deputy was responsible of reporting the health state of the roommates twice a dayin the first day of the quarantine 13 march 2020 7 of 9 mafs in a particular single room developed flu-like symptoms such as coughing odynophagia weakness and slightly elevated temperatures pcr nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for all cases most of the symptomatic quarantined mafs showed rapid resolution of the symptoms without treatment except for two of them they showed persistent mild cough and slightly elevated temperaturesnasopharyngeal swab was repeated on 17 march 2020 in these two patients one was positive for covid-19 patient 2 isolation of the entire room was ordered for 10 more days the maf in the other rooms did not show any symptoms and quarantine could be withheld after 120 hoursboth sars-cov-2 positive cases patients 1 and 2 showed a very mild disease patient 1 had fever for 2 days 388c and 381c patient 2 never developed fever after 2 days in patient 1 and 3 days in patient 2 symptoms of covid-19 disappeared completely after 2 and 3 days symptoms of covid-19 disappeared completely in patient 1 and 2 respectivelyseven days after initial diagnosis 20 march we repeated pcr testing of nasopharyngeal swabs both patient 1 and patient 2 were still positive although they had been completely asymptomatic and well for the past 5 and 4 days respectivelyinterestingly patient 2 had very limited direct contact to patient 1 but they both had contact to a third person which remained asymptomatic the whole course of the quarantine and tested negative for sars-cov-2 although remaining unproven the third person was likely an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carrier this patient may have been the link with patients 1 and 2finally we performed serological test on isolated maf 14 days after patient 1 was diagnosed with covid-19 in patients 1 and 2 serological testing was positive for both igm and igg interestingly all other close contacts to our positive patients including the third suspected asymptomatic carrier tested negativethe covid-19 epidemic is a rapidly spreading disease that is met with exceptional sanitary measures worldwide to limit its spread as illustrated in our case series limiting the spread of the disease has proven to be highly challenging for several reasonsfirst hygiene measures such as hand washing social distancing and sneezing andor coughing in the elbow are basic measures that only show limited efficacy in the particular conditions of a recruit school and military barracks some of these measures are hardly feasible and impracticalstrict contact isolation is required it has been shown that viable sars-cov-2 on plastic surfaces can be present up to 72 hours after inoculation in experimental setting9 making contagion through door knobs and scale ramps very likely9 it is therefore paramount to ensure separate catering sanitation and lodging with increasing case and suspected numbers patients with sars-cov-2 and quarantined mafs it can become increasingly difficult to obtain appropriate facilities in a military environment as emergency solution we used tents to extend lodging capacity for quarantined mafs figures 13our series shall emphasise the psychological burden during the time of quarantine and isolation10 although in the military setting we had the relative advantage of having to group mafs for logistical reasons which resulted in although isolated yet not lonely quarantine conditionssecond many young people are largely asymptomatic but may be sars-cov-2 carriers transmitting the disease11 estimates reach from 18 to at least 59 in some studies12 13 although fever and cough are described as the most common symptoms and sometimes deemed to be typical of covid-1914 it is very important to remember that in young adults symptomatology can be much milder and quite atypical our two patients showed a mild course disease with symptom resolution after few days but continued to be positive for sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs this finding underlies the importance of prolonged isolation to reduce further virus transmission as sars-cov-2 can still be proven in apparently healthy adults many days after symptom resolution15 this is also paramount for health workers to not underestimate as if they became infected the risk of further spreading the disease while willing to treat it is high15
covert virus spreading also seems to occur during the preclinical inoculation period mean incubation time was reported to be 62 days range 214 with asymptomatic carriers before and after the clinical overt phase if any present16 in the preclinical phase it is important to separate any person with contact to a suspected or confirmed case on 20 march 2020 the swiss government increased quarantine time recommendations from 5 days up to 10 days our findings support this decision as it covers more accurately the incubation time for contactshowever some slightly symptomatic carriers may test negative in pcr of nasopharyngeal swabs therefore it is important to time adequately swabs and to repeat them if clinical suspicion of covid-19 is present wang et al
17 described the highest sensitivity for pcr for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 93 followed by sputum 72 nasal swabs 63 and pharyngeal swabs 32 a combination of different or symptom-oriented swap localisation may be usefulof note sars-cov-2 can also be transmitted by oralfaecal route with viral shedding proven in stool specimen of patients with covid-1917
the relative lack of sensitivity of pcr especially in young and healthy population poses great challenges to epidemic control17 18 for that reason serological testing has gained great interest in the past weeks but still requires further validation19 in our case series none of the asymptomatic close contacts to patients 1 and 2 tested positive for pcr andor serology one possible explanation is that hygiene measures during quarantine and isolation were sufficient to avoid further spread however considering the high reproduction number of covid-19 a false-negative pcr from nasopharyngeal swab and false negative serology have to be considered for the latter a weak to mild symptomatology could explain the lack of detectable immune reaction20 finally negative serological testing might be linked to not yet fully validated technology19 how covert shedding of sars-cov-2 may be reduced in the future for example by prophylactic hydroxychloroquine21 remains unknown but is of great strategic interest for civil and military authoritiesyoung and healthy patients often show a mild course when infected with sars-cov-2 they may be before and after symptom presentation carriers and spreaders of sars-cov-2 this factor may lead to significant covert viral transmissionan early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contact persons respectively is therefore essential to slow down sars-cov-2 epidemic growth especially in confined space conditions seen in a military settingstudy participants were recruited from 33 ltcfs in the boston massachusetts area over a 3year period from 1998 to 2000

 paired serum samples were screened at a single dilution and those showing a 15 times or more greater optical density reading from acute to convalescent specimens were further tested using full dilution to determine antibody titer serial twofold dilutions of each sample were tested in duplicate and infection was defined as a more than quadrupling in antibody from baseline to week 53 because piv1 and piv3 antibodies crossreact infection with these viruses cannot be distinguished serologically therefore a serological response to piv3 antigen is designated piv13all analyses were performed using sas for windows version 913 sas institute inc cary nc chisquare and fisher exact tests were used to compare proportions means were compared using the student ttest for independent samples the association between clinical illness yes or no and number of viral infections diagnosed 0 1 or 2 was assessed using the mantelhaenszel chisquare statistic for linear association as implemented in sas proc freqa total of 617 persons were enrolled in the trial of these 452 73 completed the study and 382 62 had paired sera available at baseline and 53 weeks for viral analysis differences between the baseline characteristics of those who did and did not undergo viral testing were not statistically significant data not shown demographics and underlying medical conditions were also similar for the group with documented viral infection and those who tested negative for viral infection table 1overall 204 viral infections were documented in 157 subjects thus 41 of participants had at least one viral infection during the 1year study period one hundred seventeen subjects had one infection 34 had two infections five had three infections and one had evidence of four viral infections serological responses to all eight viruses were documented in the study patients with hmpv and coronavirus 229e being the most common and piv2 the least frequent table 2 although the activity of individual viruses varied according to year studied all viral infections were identified each year displayed graphically as cases per facility in each year figure 1 these data indicate the complex nature of viral respiratory disease in nursing homes with the exception of two facilities in which 42 1999 and 28 2000 of residents tested were positive for hmpv and one facility with a 36 positive rate for influenza a during 1999 there did not appear to be predominance of a single pathogen within a nursing home rather a multitude of pathogens circulating throughout the facilities during all 3 years was observedbecause sera were not collected immediately surrounding each illness a specific etiology could not be assigned to an individual illness but analysis of the clinical data showed a significant association between serological diagnosis of a viral infection and the occurrence of bronchitis p007 pneumonia p02 any lri p002 and any respiratory infection p02 but not uri p17 according to mantelhaenszel chisquarethis report demonstrates the wide range of respiratory viruses that circulate in ltcfs previous reports of viral disease in these populations have focused primarily on outbreaks of specific viruses most often influenza

 there have also been a number of prospective studies that have examined the role of other respiratory viruses such as rsv and parainfluenza in nursing homes but most have been limited to a single season or institution

 this study is unique in that 33 nursing homes over a 3year period were under surveillance and evaluation of eight different viral infections was undertaken although this trial was not designed to examine the specific microbiological etiology of respiratory illnesses the collection of blood at baseline and 1 year provided an opportunity for serological diagnosis of multiple viral infections over time in addition to the wellrecognized pathogens influenza and rsv infections due to hmpv coronaviruses oc43 and 229e and parainfluenza viruses were identified throughout the study period rather than large outbreaks of single pathogens a veritable cornucopia of viruses circulated in individual nursing homes each yeara rise in viralspecific antibody according to eia remains sensitive and specific for detection of infection for most respiratory viruses in elderly people even when compared with new molecular methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr

21
 several exceptions are worth noting one being influenza in which response to vaccination may complicate the serological diagnosis of infection in the current study 24 and 19 residents were diagnosed with influenza a and b respectively none of the subjects infected with influenza a showed antibody rises to influenza b and vice versa suggesting that antibody rises were not vaccine induced in addition vaccine effect was less likely because serum samples were obtained 7 to 9 months after immunization when vaccine induced antibody has typically decreased to near baseline
22
 another limitation of serology for viral diagnosis is the inability to identify rhinovirus rhinovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen that has been shown to cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in nursing homes but serological diagnosis is not possible because multiple serotypes exist
23
 because rhinoviruses are a frequent cause of the common cold it is not surprising that no association was found between uri and serological viral diagnosispresently there are limited data in elderly people on the newly described virus hmpv and its role as a cause of illness in ltcfs outbreaks of hmpv infection with significant morbidity and mortality in ltcfs have been reported in the united states canada and japan
16
 
24
 in each report diagnosis was made using rtpcr and the number of documented cases was small in this study hmpv was the most common infection diagnosed accounting for 24 of the documented viral infections asymptomatic serological infection has been described in 95 of young and 15 of elderly adults
9
 the clinical syndromes were not assessed in the current study and therefore the true effect of hmpv could not be assessed however the frequency of infection indicates that prospective studies of hmpv in ltcfs are neededsimilar to hmpv coronaviruses are difficult to detect using standard viral cultures thus few data are available on the effect of these viruses in longterm care in a prospective study of 11 nursing homes in the united kingdom using serology for diagnosis 11 of acute respiratory infections were due to coronavirus oc43 or 229e
18
 outbreaks of respiratory illness due to coronavirus oc43 mimicking influenza have also been described in nursing homes
25
 coronaviruses oc43 and 229e were common in the current study accounting for 6 and 11 of infections respectively two new strains of human coronaviruses have recently been identified nl63 and hku1 and will require further study to determine whether these viruses are also important pathogens in this population
26
 
27

the current study demonstrates the complex nature of respiratory tract infections in ltcfs influenza infection was identified in 11 of residents which confirms the need for improved influenza vaccines in this population yet the broad range of other viruses circulating each year was impressive underscoring the importance of viralspecific diagnosis during outbreak investigations or clinical trials of vaccines or antivirals these data should provide useful information for those wishing to pursue clinical trials related to respiratory viral infections in nursing home populations
