first reported in wuhan china on december 31 2019 the outbreak of covid-19 remains ongoing and was linked to more than 80000 infected patients and more than 3000 deaths in china as of march 7 2020 holshue et al 2020  currently the real-time rt-pcr assay is the gold-standard methodto diagnose sars-cov-2 however false-negative cases have been reported due to problems with sample collection and transportation rna extraction enzyme inhibitors and the rt-pcr method lu et al 2020  by contrast conventional serological assays such as the enzyme-linked immunoassay elisa for specific igm and igg antibodies have a high-throughput advantage and they avoid false -negative cases that occur with the rt-pcr method xiao et al 2020  to assay the concentration of antibodies igm and igg responsible for the coronavirus spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins in the serum we developed elisa and chemiluminescence methods for serum samples to detect igm and igg antibodies responsible fors and n proteins respectively the n gene of the sars-cov-2 was cloned into a pet28a vector and the s gene was cloned into a pmfcig vector the proteins were expressed in e coli and freestyle 293-f cells and purified by affinity chromatography both immunological methods were compared to the nucleic acid detection assay sample size calculation was based on the desired sensitivity and specificity negida et al 2019 and the operator received curve roc was constructed with spss version 250 the n proteins appeared as an obvious band at approximately 50 kd which is consistent with their theoretical molecular weight of 491 kd  figure s1a and s1c the the rbd-mfc band was consistent with its estimated molecular weight of approximately 60 kd  figure s1b  because there were several glycosylation sites with most located in the s1 subunit of the s protein of the coronavirus the rbd-mfc band was larger than the theoretical molecular weight of the rbd of the s protein 51 kd this change in the molecular weight of s protein of sars-co was also shown in a previous study yuan et al 2017  the a 450 boosted with the increase in the concentration of rbd-mfc expressed by our method described above in the interaction assay of the rbd-mfc with human ace2  figure s1d  in our study the median age was 48 years ranging from 18 years to 82 years and 340 of the patients were male to investigate the efficacy of the elisa method samples from 47 covid-19 participants who were nucleic acid-positive table s1  and 300 healthy controls were analyzed the 47 positive serum samples produced a median a 450 of 1078 for rn-based igg which was much higher than it was in all healthy controls median a 450 of 0036 t4220 p00001  figure 1a  the mean a 450 value rs-based igg for the serum samples obtained from the covid-19 patients was 0405 range 0032 to 1029 and the normal controls had a median a 450 value of 0079 t1783 p00001  figure 1b  these results suggest that the elisa was able to detect the covid-19 igg antibody in both rn-based igg and rs-based igg because all the nucleic acid-positive results detection had higher values than that in the normal controls however the range of a 450 value from 0032 to 0402 in rs-based igg testing results involve not only positive cases but also control subjects which indicated that further testing and observation should be conducted to ensure the correct conclusion for rn-based igm patients had a median value of 1453 range 0381 to 2217 the negative controls had lower a 450 values with a median of 0059 t4936 p00001  figure 1c  for rs-based igm the median of positive patients was 1398 ranging from 0111 to 2818 which was higher than that of the control group t3158 p00001  figure 1d  the results showed that the auc of rn-based igg reached 0999 p0001 figure 1g  the optimal cutoff value was 0443 with sensitivity and specificity values of 979 and 997 respectively according to the cutoff value there was only one patient who had a positive nucleotide result and a negative elsia result the results showed that the auc of rsbased igg was 0949 p0001 figure 1h  its optimal cutoff value was 0176 with sensitivity and specificity values of 957 and 857 respectively the sensitivity and specificity values of rn-based igm were 979 and 997 respectively with an auc of 0994 p0001 figure 1i  for rs-based igm the optimal cutoff value was 0167 with sensitivity and specificity values of 891 and 970 respectively p0001 figure 1j  in chemiluminescence the positive patients showed much higher level in igg compared with normal controls t720 p00001  figure 1e  in igm the statistical difference existed between the positive and negative t1140 p00001  figure 1f  an analysis of the roc curve for igg in chemiluminescence demonstrated an optimal cut off value of 0199 p0001 sensitivity of 956 and specificity of 966 the auc was 0996  figure 1k  for igm the results showed that the auc reached 0993 p0001 figure  1l  the optimal cutoff value was 0230 with sensitivity and specificity values of 977 and 952 respectively for patients who were confirmed positive by the nucleic acid assay but had a negative chemiluminescence result we analyzed the corresponding a 450 by the elisa method two confirmed patients had a negative rn-based igg analysis result their average a 450 values were 0651 and 1122 one confirmed patient was negative in the rs-based igm analysis with an a 450 value of 1647 the patients a 450 values exceeded the corresponding median value of the normal controls therefore the two methods could be simultaneously performed to monitor the titer of antibodies and provide more comprehensive information although detection of the rna by either pcr or sequencing is the gold standard for covid-19 diagnosis false negative results of the nucleotide assay have been reported due to problems related to sample collection andor detection methods in this study both the elisa and the chemiluminescence methods exhibited good consistency with nucleic acid detection for the elisa rn-based igg was seemingly more sensitive than rs-based igg for discriminating between the patients and the controls the differential sensitivity of the rs-based and rn-based igg elisa that was demonstrated in the present report may have originated from different restricted igg-dominated antibody responses leung et al 2004  in contrast both rn-based igm and rs-based igm were able to discriminate the positive patients from the controls so it may be a good tool to use with the nucleic acid test if a patient has a high a 450 value for igm but has anegative nucleic acid test result they should be followed and re-tested for the virus by pcr false-negative results from pcr may be misleading the rs-based igm elisa was reported to be more sensitive than the rn-based igm elisa because the s1 protein is a transmembrane protein which may easily stimulate the body to produce the igm antibody especially during early infection woo et al 2005  the limitation of serum igm and igg for covid-19 diagnosis may be that the time span after disease onset could affect the a value which may reduce the sensitivities of the assays if blood samples were collected druing the early stage of the infection they may produce false negative results other molecules including interferon rheumatoid factor non-specific igm and so on might cause false positive moreover since the identity of the n protein of sars-cov-2 and sars-co reached up to 912 there is probably to a crossreaction between the n protein of sars-cov-2 and antibodies against other human coronaviruses it is better to verify the detection results with the combination of assay against both the n protein and s proteins in conclusion our results showed that elisa and chemiluminescence methods to detect igg and igm antibodies by the recombinant n and s proteins of sars-cov-2 were more consistent with the nucleic acid detection assay they not only eliminated a possible cross reaction with other coronaviruses but also avoided potential risks in the process of inactivation the two methods are simple and cheap and require only a small amount of serum suggesting that they could be a good prospect for wide application in seroepidemiologic monitoring and may play a valuable role in practical applications for the diagnosis and epidemic control of covid-19 in the future figure s1 sds-page analysis and western blot of the

fors with adaptive chosen message security abderrahmane nitaj amr youssef mahmoud yehia riham altawy t aaron gulliver   the current digital signature infrastructure adopts schemes that rely on the hardness of factoring or finding discrete logarithms in finite groups 12 18 24 given recent advances in physics which point towards the eventual construction of large scale quantum computers 1 these hard problems will be solved in polynomial time using shors algorithm 25 lattice-based coding-based and multivariate signatures are considered quantum resilient schemes in the q1 model 7 however either their exact security with respect to quantum attacks is still not clear 5 11 or their communicationstorage complexity is impractical to a multitude of applications eg megabyte keys for the matrices of mceliece-based cryptosystems 27 on the other hand hash-based digital signatures have moderately sized keys order of kilobytes and their quantum security relies solely on that of hash functions based on grovers algorithm they have been proven to offer simple quantum resilient security properties 26 note that the proofs in 26 follow the q1 model where no superposition queries to quantum oracles are allowed 7 hash-based signature algorithms are comprised of two schemes an underlying signing scheme and an extension algorithm the former algorithm defines the main signing procedure where a key pair can be used to sign one lamport 19 winternitz one time signature scheme wots wots 8 14 or a few messages eg biba 21 hors 23 hors 22 pors 2 and fors 4 after which a new key pair should be generated to maintain security against forgery attacks more precisely the security of hash-based few time hbft signature schemes decreases after revealing each signature and hence their bit-security is given under the condition that re-keying is required after r signatures accordingly translating this constraint to acceptable attack models implies that a maximum of r queries are allowed to the signing oracle the extension algorithm is a top level construction that employs several instances of underlying signing schemes ots and hbft in a merkle tree structure such an algorithm enables signing multiple messages where signatures are verified with one public key merkle root extension algorithms can be stateful such as merkle signature scheme mss 20 extended merkle signature

we analyze the security of fors against adaptive chosen message adversaries we show that its bit security with respect to adaptive chosen message attacks decreases significantly when compared to its security in a non-adaptive setting we adopt the adaptive chosen message attack model defined by reyzin and reyzin 23 and used in the analysis of hors and porswe propose a hash chaining mechanism that binds the process of generating a message ors with signing it which eliminates the offline adversarial advantage and makes ors generation feasible only for the signing entity we apply the chaining scheme to fors and present dynamic forest of random subsets dfors a new hors variant that resists adaptive chosen message attacks we show that the bit-security of dfors with respect to adaptive chosen message attacks is more than that of fors by a factor of documentclass12ptminimal

 in this section we present a detailed analysis of dfors with respect to weak-message attacks and r-target subset resilience adversaries more precisely since the proposed chaining technique does not allow an adaptive adversary who has knowledge of k to compute the orss of any message of their choice before asking the signing oracle for its signature dfors is essentially r-subset resilient hence our analysis focuses on its security when an adversary is given the signatures of r messages weak-message attacks dfors inherits fors mitigation to weak-message attacks 6 because it specifies an independent key pool for each index in the ors consequently even if an ors element is repeated the corresponding revealed secret keys will be different r-target subset resilience according to definition 3 we assume an adversary documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentenddocument  but rather provides a better understanding of the security of its underlying signing scheme and offers a mechanism that can be adopted by most hors variants to provide security against adaptive chosen message attacks  histo-blood group glycans in the context of personalized medicine viktoria dotz manfred wuhrer   more than a century after the discovery of the abo blood group bg by karl landsteiner 1 currently over 30 different bg systems and more than 300 recognized bg antigens are defined by the international society for blood transfusion isbt 2 a recent overview is provided on the societys website 3 the different bg antigens evolve from genetic polymorphisms of red blood cell rbc surface molecules most of which are peptides and some are carbohydrates such as abo antigens 3 however bg antigens including abo are not only expressed on rbcs but are also present in many tissues 4 therefore these histo-bg antigens appear to be relevant not only in transfusion medicine but also in transplantation 5 moreover histo-bg antigens may also occur in glandular secretions for example abo and lewis antigens are found on saliva mucins and free oligosaccharides are found in milk and urine 6 7 8 9 structurally these particular histo-bgs are glycans defined as any sugar or assembly of sugars in free form or attached to another molecule 10 glycans in general are known to be directly involved in the pathophysiology of every major disease and it has been concluded that knowledge from glycoscience will be needed to realize the goals of personalized medicine and to take advantage of the substantial investments in human genome and proteome research and its impact on human health as stated by a recent report from the us national academies 11 although the lack of expression of bg antigens is not directly resulting in disease as known so far the presence or absence of certain bg antigens on rbc surfaces or in other tissues or bodily fluids has been found to be associated with susceptibility to various diseases beyond their recognized role in incompatibility reactions during transfusion transplantation or pregnancy largest body of evidence for the carbohydrate-based histo-bgs abo lewis le and secretor se is available particularly in the context of infectious diseases and cancer reviewed in 12 13 14 15 16 nevertheless histo-bg glycans are far from being exploited for diagnostic or therapeutic applications apart from the prominent exception of the cancer antigen ca 19-9 ie sialyl-lea
17 glycan-based bgs ie abo p1pk le h and se ii globoside glob forssman fors and the high-incidence antigen sda altogether represent more than 20 distinct antigenic structures an overview of the glycan-based bg systems and the associated rbc phenotypes with their distributions among populations is given in table 1
 in this review the potential use of these glycan-based histo-bgs in the context of personalized medicine will be discussed as well as the technology suitable for determining them in a research as well as clinical setting ii epitopes are based on repeating units of either linear or 16-branched n-acetyllactosamine chains fig 2d 41 42 43 the name of the blood group emerged from an abbreviation of individuality and thus represents an upper and a lower-case letter i both structures are ubiquitously expressed with the exception of the very rare adult i phenotype lacking branched i structures either on erythrocytes only or even tissue-wide depending on the type of mutation 23 44 similar to other polylactosamines ii structures are substrates to various glycosyltransferases including sialyltransferases and abo and le bg transferases as described in the following for review see refs 32 45 the biosynthesis of the antigens from abo and le histo-bgs is closely related although the responsible glycosyltransferases are expressed from several independent genes abo gene on chromosome 9 h-gene fut1 se-gene fut2 and le-gene fut3 on chromosome 19 34 37 for abbreviated as well as full names including linkage specificities and responsible genes of the fucosyltransferases fut see table 1 starting from type 1 lactosamine residues le-fut and se-fut are competing to generate an lea or type 1h epitope led respectively 46 47 fig 2a type 1h or se antigen is a substrate for the abo gene-encoded a or b transferase producing the a or b antigen if one of the active alleles is present furthermore type 1h can be fucosylated by le-fut generating the leb epitope lea and leb structures cannot be further modified whereas a and b antigens are again substrates to le-fut resulting in aleb and bleb antigens 6 28 48 49 this pathway takes place in secretory tissues and cells other than erythrocytes since type 1 structures are highly expressed in outer epithelial layers with higher degree of differentiation eg in the oral or gut mucosa and are substrates to se-fut 4 se-fut is active in about 80 of caucasians the so-called secretors table 1 if the le gene is inactive only the precursor structures lec type 1 precursor and led type 1h that are classified as part of the bg collection 210 3 are found in plasma or on red blood cells of non-secretors and secretors respectively 28 erythrocytes normally have no se-fut or le-fut expression 50 and bear abo antigens mainly on type 2 chains which are the preferred substrates for h-fut 4 on type 2 structures lex antigens cd15 in alpha13-linkage to the subterminal glcnac are being generated by either the le-dependent alpha134-fut or one of the other alpha13-futs 28 fig 2b in addition to se-fut if expressed in the respective cell type the h gene-regulated h-fut will primarily synthesize type 2h structures which can be further modified by a or b transferases or alpha13-futs incl le-fut3 the action of this type of futs results in ley epitopes ie type 2 isomers of leb in analogy to the above-described pathway for type 1 chains in type 2 aley and bley will be the largest end products if all the respective glycosyltransferases are expressed in their active form 6 28 the terminal lebley a- or b-epitopes can usually not be further modified by elongation or branching the same applies to the subterminal lea or lex
6 51 the antigens of the p1pk fors glob bgs and related collections are all gsls reviewed in 12 24 the classification of these antigens has been changed several times in the past the current state according to the isbt is listed in table 1 structurally gsls are composed of a lipophilic part containing a long chain fatty acid and a sphingosine anchored in the plasma membrane and a hydrophilic glycan head group fig 1 starting from lactosylceramide either pk antigen globotriaosylceramide cd77 is synthesized via the action of the a4galt gene-encoded galactosyltransferase leading to the globo-series gsl pathway or p1 antigen is synthesized via the action of the same enzyme following two other non-bg-related glycosyltransferases generating neolacto-series gsl fig 3 for p antigen production an active b3galnt1-gene is required the structures of the globo- and neolacto-series gsls act as precursors for gsl-attached abo le and hse epitopes as indicated in fig 3 if a null-allele of either a4galt or b3galnt1 is apparent in very rare cases globo-gsls cannot be produced 52 furthermore a rare variant of the a4galt enzyme is linked to the expression of nor antigens 53 the fors1 antigen was found in individuals with an activated gbgt gene which is normally not active in humans but in some non-primate animals 27 except for p1 antigen which is rbc-specific the expression of the other related antigens is common to many tissues and cell types and expression levels can vary during cell cycle and differentiation 12 in addition to the blood group systems and collections as classified by isbt two more glycan histo-bgs should be mentioned here ie the high incidence antigen sda and the ttn system tn antigen as part of an o-linked mucin-type glycan is primarily a substrate for t-synthase a ubiquitously expressed beta3-galactosyltransferase responsible for t antigen o-glycan core 1 formation for review see ref 54 t antigen is furthermore identical with type 3 chains which can be further elongated andor decorated by other bg antigens fig 2c sda antigen is included in the high incidence 901 series according to isbt classification due to its high prevalence in caucasians similar to the discrepancy of erythrocyte vs secretions phenotypes in le bg individuals having an rbc sda  phenotype may still display sda antigens in their secretions and especially urine for review see ref 26 the minimal antigenic structure as shown in fig 2e is shared by both sda and cad antigens which are assumed to be products of the same b4galnt gene-encoded beta4-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase however the latter resulting from a more active enzyme variant consequently sda  individuals have sda structures primarily on n-linked glycans whereas cad-individuals also express these on type 3 o-linked glycans and long-chain sialyl-paraglobosides 55 the genetically determined repertoire of glycosyltransferases is the basis for an individuals histo-bg phenotype however genetic diversity with the  300 alleles found for the abo locus and  50 alleles for the h se and le loci each 25 together with zygosity gives rise to an enormous variation of the levels of antigen expression including weak phenotypes leading to blood grouping discrepancies 56 57 moreover in pregnant women individuals with different hematologic disorders and especially in newborns weak expression of histo-bg antigens on rbcs has been reported 57 58 the age-dependency of abo antigen expression on rbcs is connected to the expression of i antigen which is the major precursor of abo structures on rbcs 12 i antigen expression in rbcs is negligible at birth and reaches the full adult level by the age of 18 months 59 giving an example of the oncodevelopmental nature of histo-bg antigen expression 33 the expression levels of abose and le antigens can also vary tremendously within an adult individual over time 60 regulatory mechanisms of histo-bg-related glycogene expression such as microrna or transcription factor expression are now being studied 38 61 the vast variability of the actual histo-bg phenotypes furthermore derives from the numerous interrelations between the respective biosynthetic pathways this is demonstrated by the close relationships between abose and le bgs as well as p1pk glob and fors in addition to their precursor chains ii and ttn fig 2ad another important modification which is however not directly related to blood groups is alpha23-sialylation of the terminal galactose prior to the action of a fut on type 1 or 2 chains producing sialyl-lea and sialyl-lex antigens respectively fig 4
 these combined histo-bg antigens are recognized for their role in the context of cancer as is discussed below interestingly sialyltransferases also compete with futs for the same substrates and can therefore have an impact on the expression levels of the inter-connected abo and le glycan bg antigens 12 the different levels of substrate specificities have an additional impact on the overall complexity of the biosynthetic network of histo-bg glycosyltransferases some antigens can be synthesized by more than one enzyme see hse and in some instances enzymes are not limited to only one type of acceptors see chain types 14 for se-fut or the various substrates of le-fut or one type of linkage s le-fut acting as alpha13 and alpha14-fut taken together various factors can have an impact on the final phenotype ie the presence of individual histo-bg glycans on a cell surface or in a body fluid obviously the various associations found between bg glycans and different diseases disease stages and health-promoting factors are making histo-bg glycans an intriguing topic in the field of personalized medicine as discussed in the following paragraphs in table 2 the major conclusions from selected epidemiological studies reporting on associations between different diseases and abo le and se histo-bgs are summarized for all the common and most rare bg phenotypes on rbcs no direct causative relationship is known between the bg null-alleles and inherited diseases 5 12 since glycans are known for their predominant role as recognition molecules in particular in infection the association of glycan histo-bg polymorphisms with various infectious diseases is not surprising many vertebrate species have maintained a functional ab gene however in humans roughly half of the population has o genotype resulting in a non-functional ab enzyme abo polymorphism has been linked to evolutionary adaptation as defense against inter- and intra-species infections since individuals produce antibodies against the non-self ab antigens after the exposure to these antigens originating from eg pathogens 62 masking of pathogen adhesion glycotopes by other glycans is another defense mechanism suggested 63 whereas microbial attachment sites on epithelial surfaces can support colonization histo-bg antigens on soluble glycans such as mucins or free oligosaccharides from human milk may serve as decoy receptors in pathogen defense 64 65 66 fig 1 glycan epitopes including histo-bgs have an important role in host-pathogen interactions since glycans act as recognition sites for bacterial adhesins and secondly pathogens express surface epitopes to mimic those of the host to evade immune response as proposed for helicobacter pylori le antigens 14 remarkably h pylori is able to bind to the same antigenic structures on the hosts epithelial surface 91 h pylori is present in half of the world population and chronic infection is linked to gastritis peptic ulcer and gastric cancer with a high degree of heterogeneity in disease phenotypes 92 the bacterium is able to attach only to leb antigen without additional a or b epitopes and has therefore been proposed to be linked to bg o 91 however clinical data on the association of h pylori gastric cancer and abole bgs are contradictory table 2 a higher incidence of h pylori in o and a lower incidence in a-individuals have been reported in multiple studies 63 strikingly gastric cancer risk was higher in a bg incidence rate ratio 120 95 ci 102142 whereas peptic ulcer risk was found to be higher in o-individuals in a large population-based study 68 the link to le and se phenotype seems to be even more unclear for instance se status and h pylori infection have shown to be independent risk factors for gastric disease with a higher risk in non-se 81 although leb se seems to play a crucial role in h pylori adhesion 12 91 on tissue level h pylori infected patients with gastric ulcer were shown to have increased lea and loss of h and leb expression in their inflamed gastric mucosa 7 the authors claimed abo and le antigens to be good indicators for cellular alterations in the gastric epithelium le- and se-positive women were found to have lower risk for urinary tract infections as compared to le-negative or non-se 75 since adhesins from uropathogenic escherichia coli recognize various globo-series gsls including fors1 p and especially the sialylated lke antigens in vitro 93 a masking function of antigens competing with sialylation in secretors ie leb and ab has been proposed 94 b and ab individuals in a pediatric cohort were found to be more susceptible to salmonellosis and various e coli types of infections meningitis sepsis pyelonephritis as compared to a or o individuals 71 in contrast shigella infections were more prevalent in o individuals 71 this relates to the higher susceptibility of o-individuals to infection by another shiga-toxin related bacterial strain ie e coli o157 67 the same study found p-negative individuals to be more likely to develop severe hemolytic uremic syndrome after infection possibly due to higher induction of tnf-alpha 67 pk lke and fors1 histo-bg antigens have been associated with other shiga toxin- and verotoxin-producing e coli strains stec and ehec 24 95 moreover pk-knockout mice showed no reaction to verotoxin administration whereas basal levels of pk expression were already lethal to wild-type mice 52 shiga- and verotoxin-binding pk antigen is further found in human milk and may act as decoy receptor in breastfed infants that are at lower risk for diarrheal diseases as compared to formula-fed ones 96 the level of se-positive free oligosaccharides in human milk has also been positively correlated with eg protection against e coli-induced diarrhea in breastfed infants 97 similarly alpha-12-fucosylated oligosaccharides from human milk were associated with protection against campylobacter jejuni diarrhea 98 possibly due to their function as decoy receptors 99 in premature infants non- or low-se phenotype as well as genotype was furthermore associated with severe outcomes such as necrotizing enterocolitis or gram-negative sepsis 80 expressing ab antigens on epithelia and in secretions as is the case in se-positive individuals might furthermore be protective against pneumonia caused by streptococci
63 78 this pathogen secretes glycosidases acting on type 2 chain a b and ley structures which are known virulence factors 100 secretors predominantly express type 1 chains shielded by a and b epitopes and might therefore be protected against pathogen adhesion non-secretors have also been reported being more susceptible to infections caused by neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae
78 79 se le and ab bgs seem to also play a role in vibrio cholerae infection and disease severity 101 102 pk p abh antigens and 2- and 3-fucosyllactose the latter two being milk oligosaccharides generated by se- and le-fucosyltransferases respectively may play a role in pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion 103 104 pk antigen also binds to adhesin p from streptococcus suis a pig pathogen that can cause meningitis in humans 105 various studies have demonstrated the stimulation of antibody titers against bg antigens under different conditions of bacterial exposure thus supporting the hypothesis of an immunologic defense function of bg antigen non-expression 12 another indication for the implication of abo histo-bgs in immunological processes was given by the findings that the efficacy and the vibriocidal antibody response of cholera vaccines was lower in bg o compared to bg a individuals 106 107 therefore exploring the role of anti-bg antibody response and protection following specific vaccinations is of great interest as has been shown in a systems biology approach using glycan microarray analysis of immunoglobulin g preparations from different healthy populations 108 the pooled antibody preparations bound to various self-antigen ligands including especially glob fors1 ley bg a1 and bg b epitopes but also h2 and sialyl-lea in some cases the authors suggested a protective role for these self-antibodies by blocking bacterial attachment sites if released on epithelial surfaces in the context of viral infections associations of non-b as well as se genotype and phenotype with norovirus or rotavirus infection and gastroenteritis have been reported in numerous studies table 2 84 85 86 87 88 in addition a certain rotavirus genotype p11 that mainly infects neonates was found to attach specifically to saliva from neonates and infants but not adults due to high expression of polylactosamines ie the i antigen 109 different viral proteins from selected rotaviral genotypes were found to bind to either i epitopes or their type 1 isomers with or without internal lex of human milk oligosaccharides in a strain- and viral protein-dependent manner 64 consequently infectivity seems to be highly dependent on the virus genotype in interaction with the host ancestryethnicity and different histo-bgs for norovirus multivalent virus-like particle vaccines have therefore been proposed representing a broad set of viral genotypes and strains 110 interestingly anti-histo-bg but not immunoglobulin g or total antibody titers prior to the challenge with norovirus were positively correlated with protection against infection in placebo-recipients while in vaccinees the frequency of severe disease was lower with higher pre-challenge anti-histo-bg antibody titers 111 for the development of efficient vaccines against norovirus and rotavirus individualized approaches addressing all the relevant factors such as virus genotype the specific particles and adjuvants used in the vaccine and their interaction with the histo-bg antigens and anti-histo-bg antibodies of the recipients will be of particular interest in the future o-bg was associated with resistance towards severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 112 se phenotype has been linked to other respiratory virus diseases including influenza rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus and echovirus 89 non-secretor genotype and phenotype are also associated with protective aspects in hiv such as reduced infection risk p  029 90 and slower disease progression p  001 113 likewise pk expression has been shown protective against hiv-1 infection in vitro as compared to p phenotype 114 the role of the p1pk bg in hiv infection is reviewed in ref 115 in contrast p antigen might be implicated in parvovirus b19 infection shown as its primary receptor 116 bgs have also been associated with parasitic diseases table 2 in particular bg-o is a recognized genetic factor for a lower risk of severe malaria 72 the high percentage of o-individuals in malaria-endemic regions supports the hypothesis for a selective advantage of having bg o 13 furthermore the incidence of schistosome infection and disease severity has been linked to a-bg 69 since histo-bg glycans are recognized for their role as oncodevelopmental antigens 33 and are moreover linked to tissue differentiation stage 4 it is not surprising that changes in their expression in the context of malignancies have been described 30 117  and more recently other glycosylation changes in cancer for extensive reviews see refs 15 118 119 moreover epidemiological studies found a decreased risk of various types of cancers in bg o and an increased risk in bg a as found in a meta-analysis 70 table 2 however in another meta-analysis no significant association was found when comparing o vs non-o bgs except for exocrine pancreatic cancer or  053 and 95 ci 033083 for bg-o vs non-o 73 further associations were found for le and se genotypes with breast cancer susceptibility and axillary lymph nodes metastasis respectively 76 in clinical samples an increase of either incompletetruncated precursor structures t tn pk h ii type 1 chain or de novo expressed cancer antigens ie increased sialyl-leax fig 4 or fors1 p leb se and a antigens in otherwise null-allelic individuals is observed in various cancer types depending on the cancer stage 15 120 121 accordingly sialyl-tn is a recognized tumor marker and has been proposed as a target for the design of anticancer vaccines 122 however with limited success to date 123 sialyl-leax appear to play a role in later tumor stages and especially in metastasis 15 notably fut3 le and alpha23-sialyltransferase transcription and sialyl-leax antigen expression was shown to be upregulated in h pylori infected patients with early onset gastric carcinoma 124 moreover sialyl-lea ca19-9 is elevated in various types of gastrointestinal carcinomas and is an approved prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer therapy however in le-positive patients only since le-negative individuals do not express an active alpha14-fut sialyl-leaca19-9 serum levels are significantly lower or even non-detectable in pancreatic cancer patients with null-allelic le-gene 17 another significant glycomic bg antigen change in cancer is a loss of a and b antigens in premalignant or malignant and metastatic tissue of otherwise a- or b-positive individuals 120 125 126 127 this switch has furthermore been linked to enhanced cellular motility and poor prognosis 117 the ab expression loss goes along with a higher abundance of the precursor structure i antigen in carcinomas from secretors whereas cancerous tissue from non-secretors experiences a lower i antigen expression 121 moreover an increased distribution of h antigen throughout all the layers of malignant tissue as compared to a more restricted pattern in normal mucosa has been found 126 128 analogously alpha12-fut activity from both se- and h-gene encoded enzymes were higher in rectal carcinomas than in normal tissue 129 interestingly seh-antigens were found in cecal tumors from se- as well as non-se patients while being absent in normal tissues of non-secretors a very recent investigation of cyst fluid and tissue from ovarian tumors has shown remarkable differences in abo bg antigen expression between different tumor stages and subtypes 130 by using mass spectrometry average compositions of fucosylation abo and le antigens and sialylation of mucin-type glycans the authors were able to distinguish three groups of samples i low-grade low malignant potential carcinomas and benign mucinous ii all serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas and iii serous benign samples again non-secretor samples were exceptions due to a genetically determined lower expression of bg epitopes on epithelia the described glycomic changes in cancer have a potential as therapeutic vaccine targets including histo-bg antigens 16 131 moreover abo bg was demonstrated as a possible parameter for detecting responders to a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine 132 compared to bg aab participants bg o and b patients experienced enhanced survival after vaccination especially if they developed an antibody response against the fors1 antigen this was explained by the authors by the presence of fors1 in the poxviral vector used for the vaccine showing structural similarity to the a-antigen if verified the conclusions drawn from this and similar studies could open an invaluable opportunity for an effective immunization strategy in a blood-group specific manner by designing vaccines with bg epitopes complementary to the bg of the recipients who would thereby develop an enhanced immune response in summary malignancy-associated changes of histo-bg glycans can be different in individuals with different genetic histo-bg backgrounds and may even be tumor stage- and subtype-specific revealing them as promising biomarkers for early cancer diagnostics as vaccine targets and as relevant factors to include in personalized oncotherapeutic approaches associations between abo and especially the non-se phenotype or genotype with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as crohns disease primary sclerosing cholangitis chronic pancreatitis and type 1 diabetes have been reported 21 22 82 83 in addition childhood asthma was found to have a higher incidence in secretors with bg o andor le-negative phenotype 77 a possible explanation for the higher susceptibility to crohns disease in non-secretors is the link via gut microbiota intestinal microbiome composition differs between healthy se and non-se individuals as well as between different abo phenotypes among secretors 133 134 moreover perturbations in gut microbiota metabolism and other factors of the host-microbial environment in non-secretors and fut2 heterozygous individuals with crohns disease have been reported 135 fucosylation in the gut which is primarily mediated by fut2 and can be induced by certain gut bacteria via yet unknown mechanisms has a central role in the host-microbe symbiosys and can suppress pathogens 136 interestingly host fucose utilization by specific microbes is only down-regulated in non-se mice if fed a glucose-rich polysaccharide-deficient diet demonstrating an intense interaction between host genetics diet and gut microbiome 137 notably gastrointestinal malignancies in particular colorectal cancer have also been linked to gut microbiota composition 138 intriguingly a previously unrecognized regulatory role of histo-bg antigens in inflammatory adhesion processes has been proposed due to a strong correlation of the abo locus with plasma concentrations of the soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 sicam-1 139 moreover the abo locus was associated with diabetes type 2 and e-selectin levels besides sicam-1 levels 140 in addition a lower risk of cardiovascular and associated diseases has been found for bg o individuals and linked to bg antigens on platelet glycoconjugates as recently reviewed 74 interestingly bg o individuals have lower levels of the blood clotting factors von willebrand and fviii due to their shorter plasma half-life 141 in addition to cancer-related changes in ii antigen expression mentioned above a rare disease association has been reported for the adult i phenotype a correlation was found with congenital cataracts in certain kindreds 44 this has been putatively explained by a direct effect of the lack of branched type 2 polylactosamines resulting from a certain null-allelic gene variant of the i-antigen producing enzyme in the human lens epithelial cells 23 38 44 some indications do exist that variants of the t-synthase gene generating t antigen are associated with susceptibility to iga nephropathy 142 a downregulation of the b4galnt2 gene resulting in strong reduction of sda antigen expression in the colon and a concomitant increase of sialyl-lex expression is observed in colon cancer and might offer a promising opportunity in cancer therapy in the future 143 as defined by the us food and drugs administration personalized medicine is the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics needs and preferences of a patient during all stages of care including prevention diagnosis treatment and follow-up 144 as briefly demonstrated by the example of the interaction of an individuals se status and gut microbiota histo-bgs might play a significant role already at the early stage of disease prevention another example is the various histo-bg glycans in human milk which are suggested to provide double protection to the breastfed child via their prebiotic and their antimicrobial activity in the gut 145 the decoy function of milk glycans in particular the highly abundant free oligosaccharides and mucin glycans offers a yet underexamined possibility for a novel preventive and therapeutic antibiotic strategy emerging high-throughput analytical technologies such as glycan microarrays multiplexed capillary electrophoresis or matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization maldi mass spectrometry ms will pave the way for the discovery of such novel bioactive compounds 64 65 146 147 traditionally bg phenotyping is performed via targeted immunological assays using antisera lectins or monoclonal antibodies with or without staining on body fluids or tissues to determine the specific antigenicities 41 121 130 148 149 an immunoassay is also used for the determination of ca19-9 sialyl-lea levels in clinics 17 genotyping glycosyltransferase transcript analysis as well as standard proteomic techniques are currently being increasingly used also in the context of bg-typing 27 130 and do therefore comply with the requirements of modern personalized medicine furthermore they might be useful for patient stratification in settings where the genetic histo-bg background in combination with the natural anti-bg antigen antibodies plays a role such as vaccine efficacy studies the reverse abo-typing method developed by muthana and colleagues by using only 4 l of serum with glycan arrays was proven as particularly useful since it enabled retrospective bg typing without having whole blood samples available 132 our current knowledge on the significance of histo-bgs in the context of disease as summarized in 5 6 is thus far mainly based on observational studies stratifying patients and controls by their blood type and showing associations with disease or disease stages table 2 information on the underlying mechanisms is very limited to date possibly due to the extremely reductionistic approach that emerged from transfusion medicine ie grouping individuals into a few categories deduced from their serological phenotype table 1 table 2 however the knowledge of a patients rbc pheno genotype or glycosyltransferase expression is only indicative for the final complex glycomic profile 62 especially if taking into account the vast tissue- and disease-specific variations of the histo-bg antigens their precursors and conjugates as well as interactions between different bgs as discussed in 2 4 thus simultaneous mapping of glycans from different histo-bgs next to the information on their carriers would provide the increased degree of comprehensiveness that is required to investigate the mechanisms behind the bg-to-disease associations presented above modern glyco-analytical techniques such as ms and liquid chromatography are in principle capable to provide this type of information on multiple levels1semi-quantitative determination of terminal glycosylation including histo-bg glycans as well as sialylation the levels of which appear to be inter-related2mapping of the

 thus instead of just assigning samples to a limited set of categories as based on traditional or genetic bg typing advanced glyco-analytics will enable an unprecedented insight into the vast complexity and variety of structures fig 1 reflecting the underlying complex biological processes therefore glycomic together with glycoproteomic and glycolipidomic technologies should be further refined to allow unambiguous isomer-specific structural characterization and optimally quantitation of histo-bg glycans that have high potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in the context of both infectious and non-communicable diseases currently applied glyco-analytical techniques in the field of biomarker discovery from cancer tissues are presented in ref 150 major progress in glycomic approaches distinguishing linkages andor different monosaccharide species has been made recently in the field of n- and o-glycomics 151 152 however glycomics of histo-bgs has been neglected in the last years except for some few rather targeted approaches 153 154 155 in a very recent study traditional targeted techniques in combination with liquid-chromatography-msms were successfully applied showing great potential of mucin-type histo-bg glycans for ovarian tumor staging and classification not only from tissues but also from cystic fluid 130 glycomic approaches on only minute amounts of preferably non-invasively acquired patient samples such as saliva tears milk urine or feces 66 156 157 158 159 will be of particular use in the context of early diagnosis and population-wide screening the discovery of novel functions of histo-bgs by applying high-end technologies is warranted interestingly the spatial organization of abo antigen patches on rbcs from a b and o individuals was shown to differ in bg-specific manner resulting in higher or lower binding of sialic acid-binding proteins siglecs to sialic acid-rich clusters that are co-expressed nearby the abh regions 160 the authors claimed having found a novel function of abh antigens ie as indirect stabilizers of other glycan-protein interactions further research is warranted to reveal the function relevance of such multi-compound complexes involving the concerted binding of glycans in a multivalent manner finally a combination of the different omics techniques including glycomics will likely enhance the performance of the diagnostic and prognostic approaches 15 and pave the way for a successful translation into clinics as a first example in a pioneering combined genomics-glycomics study potential epigenetic regulatory factors of le-fut fut3 next to other futs were proposed on the basis of plasma protein n-glycome 161 studies combining genomic proteomic metabolomic and glycomic data containing histo-bg antigen information of different body fluids andor tissues could help revealing the mechanisms behind the above described disease associations and may provide improved disease biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets in the future the authors declare no conflict of interest  a mathematical model of the evolution and spread of pathogenic coronaviruses from natural host to human host fatma bozkurt ali yousef dumitru baleanu jehad alzabut   according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv coronaviruses are members of the sub-family coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales coronavirinae consists of four genera groups -coronavirus -coronavirus -coronavirus and -coronavirus 12 recently these groups are divided in terms of phylogenetic clustering while before they were sorted based on serology all viruses of nidovirales order are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses where within this the coronaviridae has the most significant identified rna genomes containing approximately 30 kilobases kb genomes on the other hand all coronaviruses have animal origin 2 3 table 1
below shows that the four genera of coronaviruses originated from animals the hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e are coronaviruses that cause mild infections in humans on the other hand sads-cov which has swine as an intermediate host role does not show any evidence of infections in humans hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 are both coronaviruses and are also mostly harmless to the human body that has a rodent-borne origin hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were isolated nearly 50 years ago while hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were identified in 2003 coronaviruses have not considered as highly pathogenic until the outbreak of sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 the spread of sars-cov in china guangdong indicated that a coronavirus was transmitted from bats to an intermediate host like market civets and from there to the human host while the outbreak of mers-cov in the middle east countries also came from bats to dromedary camels as an intermediate host and then it was transmitted to human 4 5 6 7 8 these viruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections including fever dizziness and cough on the 12th of december 2019 a new virus form of coronaviridae was reported in china wuhan the outbreak was associated again with intermediate hosts like reptilians while the natural host was assumed as bats this novel virus was designated at first as wh-human 1 and was referred after that as covid-19 by the who covid-19 was characterized by two members of -coronavirus human-origin coronavirus sars-cov tor2 and bat-origin coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 while intensive studies show that it was most closely related to the bat-origin coronavirus 9 as a result of the above discussion the primary assumption was set as the natural host of covid-19 is the bat which infects the human population with a domestic intermediate host figure 1
shows the animal origins of the human coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and covid-19 explicitly stating if we analyze the environmental origin of covid-19 then we adopt the hypothesis that says that infected bats may spread the disease these bats of genus rhinolophus are mainly in the area of shatan river valley domestic animals like snakes in that area are hunted for the food market in wuhan which had an intermediate host role in the transmission finally this virus spillover from the intermediate hosts to cause several diseases in human a virus that started with an endemic pathogenic behavior in china wuhan reaches somehow to a pandemic point worldwide in this study we give brief information about coronaviruses and introduce the genera of covid-19 we explain the transmission from the natural host to the intermediate one and from there to the human host the mathematical model in section 2 shows the spread from animal to human and human to human we noticed in our model that the transmission risk from human to human is higher and more dangerous than the effect from animal to human in the end the study reveals that the infected class who do not know they are infected because of late recognized symptoms is the major problem of a pandemic spread worldwide many research areas in biology or medicine are attractive topics for scholars engaging in applied mathematics since mathematical modeling has an essential role in understanding the dynamics of many diseases and biological phenomena over the years biological models have been formulated mathematically 10 11 12 13 mainly studies are restricted to integer-order differential equations however it is seen that many problems in biology as well as in other fields like engineering finance and economics can be formulated successfully by differential equations with piecewise constant arguments 14 15 16 17 in mathematical modeling for an overlapping species population it is convenient to use differential equations on the contrary for a non-overlapping species one it is suitable to use difference equations 14 however there are some dynamics in the environment which combine the tools of both differential-difference equations concerning time t for such biological events it is preferred to construct models of differential equations with both continuous and discrete-time relevant studies that have considered the discrete and continuous-time effects as differential equations with piecewise constant arguments are given in 17 19 20 21 the question of whether the coronavirus is used as a biological weapon or not is out of our primary objective in the paper however this question was under consideration for the plague disease 22 we consider here the pandemic infection that occurs when the virus is transmitted to the human body from the intermediate host and continues to spread from human-to-human the first three equations on the system show an si susceptible-infected model to explain the transmission from human-to-human where s is the susceptible class c
1 is the infected class which does not know that they are infected because of the late occurred symptoms of covid-19 and c2 represents the infected class that knows they are infected the spillover from the intermediate infected class m to the human host s denotes a predator-prey mathematical model while for the transmission from the natural host n which is the bat population to intermediate host m is a host-parasite model of holling type ii thus the mathematical model of this biological phenomena is modeled as follows1dsdtstr1p1st1c1tst2mtst1mtstdc1dtc1tr212c1t111stc1tc1tc1t212mtc1tdc2dtc2t13c2tc1t11st22mtdmdtmtr314mt2mtftntdndtntr415ntgtntwhere2ftmt1hemtandgtmt1hemtrepresent the holling type ii functions all the parameters in 1 belong to  and t is the integer part of t  0   the susceptible s is composed of individuals that have not contacted the infection but can get infected through contact with the humans that do not know they are infected and from the intermediate hosts r1 is the population growth rate of the susceptible population and

25 the allee effect can be divided into two main types i strong allee effect and ii weak allee effect a population with a strong allee effect will have a critical population size which is the threshold of the population and any size that is less than the threshold will go to extinction without any further aid on the other hand a population with a weak allee effect will reduce the per capita growth rate at lower population density or size 26 27 28 let us incorporate an allee function to the c

1203 to compare the difference between figure 2b and figure 3b it is seen that to be aware of the symptoms in the early stages is an essential parameter that affects the speed of the transmission in section iv the rate of screening was discussed intensively and it was shown that  is one of the essential control parameters and c
2 classes where 001 the susceptible s class where 005the susceptible s class where 005 in figure 4
 we considered the human-to-human infection cases the blue graph denotes the susceptible class s the red graph the c
1 class who do not know they are infected and the green graph denotes the c
2 that knows they are infected it is seen that the infected class that do not know they are infected is higher than the class that is determined as c2 which is the infected class who is tested as positive this means that the spread of transmission from human to human occurs mainly from the c
1 which should be controlled with the parameters 
1 
2 and  
figure 5
shows a diagram of the population classes of 5 it is seen that the natural host and the intermediate host has a stable dynamical system in the habitat in contrast they have only a role as hosts in the transmission of the coronavirus the pandemic spread undergoes when the infection is transmitted from human to human the intermediate host animal shows only an endemic spread which should be considered as a minor role in this dynamical structure 
figure 6
a-d show the relation of the susceptible class st and the c
1t class who do not know they are infected we increase the screening rate in each graph to 1 5 10 and 20 respectively it is noticed that the effect of c
1t relative to st decreases finally figure 7
a and 7 b shows the rate of recognition of the dynamical behavior related to the susceptible class st and the c
1t class who do not know they are infected we found that the recognition through health organizations and media are highly operative points to stop the pandemic spread and return it to its endemic form at first we considered the rate of recognition as i04 and after that i06 for i12 which are shown in figure 7 a and b respectively in this paper we first review the reasons for the spread of coronaviruses from the natural host to the human host after that we established a model of the novel coronavirus which is known as covid-19 described by differential equations with piecewise constant arguments the model is constructed in alignment with important biological and medical reasons we divided the model into five sub-classesthe susceptible class sthe infected class c
1 that does not know they are infected since specific symptoms do not appearthe infected class c
2 that knows they are infected because of some symptoms such as respiratory and intestinal infections including fever dizziness and cough appearedthe intermediate domestic host m that has a transmission role from the natural host to the human hostthe natural host n that are bats of genus rhinolophus

 we considered in this study the pandemic infection case animal to human and human to human therefore the first three equations in the model show human to human transmission while the spillover from the intermediate infected class to the human host denotes a predator-prey mathematical model and the transmission from the natural host to intermediate host is a host-parasite model of holling type ii the main results are then stated and proved in section 3 we analyzed the local and global stability of the co-existing equilibrium point via the linearized stability theorem and a lyapunov function respectively theorem 2 and theorem 3 show the stability results when the natural host population is under control but the screening of c
1 is not high we deduced that the necessary reproduction numbers r
01  1 and r
02  1 that shows the transmission potential of the sc1 and the mn classes respectively we concluded that among the human hosts those who do not know they are infected are the control class in the spread in contrast between the animal hosts the intermediate class plays a dominant role since that class has an essential role in transmitting the disease from animal to human we noticed that c
1 can decrease if there might be a periodic screening and awareness of information transmitted through media for the susceptible class it is more important to keep the population rate per year non-infected the transmission of the virus to the offspring would reach an uncontrollable phenomenon worldwide later in section iv we incorporated the allee function at a discrete-time t we analyzed both weak and strong allee effect and obtained that screening for possible inflectional cases in discrete time is an essential control parameter to support both allee functions in stabilizing the effect of the spread we emphasized that the susceptible class and the classes who do not know they are infected are the central populations that affect the allee function in stabilizing the spread of transmission while it is the priority to keep human non-infected the other essential aim is to detect the infected class before the symptoms appear in section v we obtained that the system demonstrates a neimark-sacker bifurcation under specific conditions it is seen that the basic reproduction number r
01 and the natural host has an essential role in the mentioned bifurcation in the end numerical simulations along with graphical illustrations are presented to examine the validity of our theoretical findings we focused on two control parameters which are  the screening rate and ii12 the rate of recognition we obtained that if the screening percentage stays low the spread of infection reaches to a pandemic form since the group who do not know they are infected is the significant risk group in transmission the rate of recognition shows the behavioral act of the civilians considering the daily information from the health organizations it is seen that any discrete-time of health care protections would expand the pandemic spread over time the results of this paper studied a biomedical model that describes the character of coronavirus the analysis of the model as well as specific qualitative properties are discussed throughout the paper our study is based on mathematical interpretations and consistent with biological and medical assumptions we believe that our results are essential and of great significance for further investigations

transmitted infectious diseases infection transmission risk and different test strategies screening and confirmatory testing strategies for transfusion-transmissible viral infections infectivity of hbv and the screening strategy meeting clinical demand for blood and blood products dodd ry seed rg tadokoro  k satake  m caulfield  j wilson  j chesneau  s  testing donated blood for markers of infectious disease plays a major role in establishing and maintaining a safe blood supply minimal expectations worldwide are that blood should be tested for syphilis hiv hcv and hbv the minimal norm for the viral testing is the use of serologic procedures but increasingly nucleic acid testing is being considered or implemented where resources allow the appropriate mix of tests and testing algorithms will also depend upon the local epidemiology of the infections and may also be affected by societal issues in some parts of the world additional testing may be indicated in order to manage localized threats such as chagas disease in south and central america in developing test strategies it is important to understand the actual risk of transfusion-transmission and the impact of the test system on that risk approaches for the selection of test strategies and for estimation of risk will be discussed with particular reference to the developing world background testing donated blood for human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis b hbv hepatitis c hcv and human t-cell lymphotropic virus htlv is important as all are transfusion-transmissible viral infections ttvis a particular challenge in donor screening for ttvis is that donor selection seeks to minimize the prevalence of ttvis which in the context of testing substantially increases the likelihood that reactive test results represent false rather than true reactivity aims to address this donor testing algorithms seek to combine strategies to optimize both sensitivity optimal detection of the target pathogen and specificity minimising false reactivity methods screening algorithms vary dependent on a number of factors including the epidemiology of the ttvi in the donor population and the available resources eg funding automation level technical skill ttvi screening tests include rapid tests rt immunoassays ia and nucleic acid tests nat rt and ia target serological markers of infection anti-hiv hiv p24 antigen anti-hcv hbsag anti-hbc or anti-htlv whereas nat targets viral rna hcv and hiv or dna hbv nat has the advantage of earlier detection because viral rnadna appears in the bloodstream before serological markers however nat is comparatively expensive requiring high levels of automation and skilled staff while optimal screening strategies for hiv hcv and hbv generally include nat for its superior ability to identify donors with early infection there are alternative strategies which can provide almost equivalent safety for example the use of hiv and hcv combo ias which combine antibody with antigen hiv p24ag or hcv ag detection significantly improve sensitivity for early infection in resource poor settings rt for hiv hcv and hbv can still provide a high level of safety particularly where carefully selected repeating samples reactive on a primary screening test on a second screening test termed a sequential algorithm and assigning a final status based on concordant reactivity has been shown to improve performance confirmatory testing seeks to confirm the presence of the pathogen of interest optimising donor counseling and referral the appropriate confirmatory strategy will be dependent primarily on the screening strategy and available resourcing for hiv hcv and htlv antibody based screening strategies immunoblots are often used to confirm the presence of antibody however immunoblots are relatively costly and can have poor specificity making it important to optimise the specificity of the screening algorithm results immunoblotting subsequent to sequential screening assays has been shown to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the strategy for hbsag confirmation neutralization assays based on a reduction in signal after addition of ant-hbs are the gold standard the absence of a true confirmatory test for anti-hbc complicates confirmation of chronic hbv hbsag non-reactiveanti-hbc reactive since nat for hiv hcv and hbv have demonstrated very high specificity they now form an independent method of confirming infection in some countries samples concordantly reactive on serology and nat screening tests are considered confirmed without the need for immunoblotting summaryconclusions even in resource constrained settings optimal screening and confirmatory strategies can significantly reduce the risk of transfusion-transmissible viral infection  tadokoro k and satake m japanese red cross society tokyo japan it is estimated that there are 2 billion hbv-infected people including 350 million hbv-carriers in the world it is highly endemic in south africa amazon and southeast-central asia the genotype of hbv is geographically characteristic eg genotype b and c are the major in east asia hbv transmission remains the most frequent transfusion-transmitted viral infection despite the implementation of various screening tests applied in different settings the residual risk is mainly related to donations either in the pre-sero or pre-dna-conversion window period or occult hbv infection obi where blood test is hbv-dna-positive and hbs-ag-negative infectivity of hbv depends on the transfused blood viral load phase of infection genotype and anti-hbs in the concurrent blood and immune status of the recipients anti-hbs immunocompetence it was shown that infectivity is dependent on viral load allain et al reported that ffps is more infectious than pcs or rbcs the minimal infectious dose of blood in late acute infection phase in chimpanzee and chimeric mice is approximately 10 times higher than that of pre-acute phase satake et al reported that transmission rate of obi-derived components with low titer anti-hbc was 1333 whereas that of anti-hbc-negative components was 112250 which was verified in the lookback programme conducted in japan allain et al showed in the study conducted in europe that adjusted transmission rate of obi blood was 28 and the rate was higher without anti-hbs638 and lower with anti-hbs154 discrepancy of transmission rate of obi-derived blood between above two reports might be related to the different cutoff levels of anti-hbc and presence or absence of anti-hbs dna-positivity rate among obi-derived components is higher in those with the higher levels of anti-hbc and lower in those with the presence of anti-hbs there has been no report of transmission by obi-derived blood with anti-hbs of 200miuml or more screening test for hbv is different between countries low endemic countries screen blood for hbs-ag anti-hbc and mini-pooled nat while highly endemic countries test for hbs-ag without anti-hbc because high prevalence of anti-hbc-positive donation hamper securing necessary blood japan as a moderately endemic country had tested for hbs-ag mini-pool nat and anti-hbcanti-hbs where anti-hbs of more than 200 miuml irrespective of anti-hbc and low anti-hbc with agglutination-inhibition titer of no more than 2 5 is qualified transfusion-transmitted hbv cases related to window period donations declined by increasing the sensitivity of mini pool nat whereas those related to blood with low titer anti-hbc remained stable with around 10 cases annually in order to decrease such transmission japanese red cross implemented a novel strategy to eliminate all anti-hbc-positive donations with anti-hbs 200 miuml considering the frequency of donations with low titer anti-hbc has decreased to 13 loss of those donations was estimated to be covered by promoting donations each country should establish its own hbv screening strategy considering the prevalence of hbv residual risk of transmission balance between safety and securing blood and cost-effectiveness implementation of individual donation nat and universal vaccination could further reduce further the risk of hbv transmission our blood service is to motivate other population groups to diversify the age and gender composition of our donors forty-two percent of the whole blood donors participate in blood donation only once a year so we need develop programs to motivate them to re-join blood donation also we have to solve the annually recurring problem of blood shortages for transfusion during the winter and summer season in the long term our donor base is going to decrease gradually because of the low birth rate in korea and our rapidly aging population therefore we should prepare a sustainable solution for a stable blood supply aims present methods to recruit blood donors based on age gender and occupation groups for a stable blood supply methods to make blood donation more accessible to individual donors fixed donation sites are continuously developed facilities of our fixed and mobile sites are improved to provide safe and comfortable environment to donors since 1999 we have been operating the registered donor system for registered donors who agreed to donate their blood on a regular basis to raise awareness of the importance of blood donation among youth high-school students blood donor groups called red campaigners and groups of university students called blood donation supporters are actively participating in blood donation campaigns to increase participation of the middle-aged group agreements were made not only with enterprises and organizations but also with the government and public institutions we have developed a computerized system for scheduling group donations according to demand and supply and for performance management to recognize the necessity of blood donation every 13th was designated as blood donation day in 2012 to deal with donor complaints and requests a customer relationship management center has been established results by increasing the number of fixed donation sites and making donation more accessible rate of individual donations is getting increased as of the end of june 2013 250 agreements for blood donation had been signed with enterprises and organizations every year more than 100 thousand donors agree to donate on a regular basis and so far about 600 thousand donors have been registered in the registered donor system the campaign every 13th is blood donation day has contributed to spread a positive perception about blood donation conclusions we have been very successful in engaging youth in blood donation diversification of the donor group will take time and constant effort however with more participation of female donors and retention of our first-time donors it will be possible to be self-sufficient in blood supply for transfusion and plasma fractionation the provision of sufficient safe blood products to patients requiring transfusion is the common goal of blood transfusion services and the public expectation of absolute safety continues to be a challenge although the focus of blood safety falls on laboratory testing the role of pre-donation donor selection cannot be underestimated transfusion-transmitted infections ttis are blood-borne microbes that can be spread from blood donor to recipient via transfusion to prevent tti donated blood must go through validated laboratory testing in most countries blood is tested for hiv hbv hcv and syphilis screening for other ttis may also be implemented in some countries after individual assessment of the prevalence of the infection in their general populations for example west nile virus in the united states with the advance in testing technology in particular the nucleic acid test the window periods for the detection of various ttis have been significantly shortened however the risk of window donation still exists furthermore there are known or emerging ttis such as the variant creutzfeldtjakcob disease vcjd where there is still no suitable testing system for routine screening of donated blood therefore blood transfusion services have to continue practicing effective pre-donation donor selection to mitigate the tti risks who recommends selecting voluntary non-remunerated donors from low-risk populations for blood collection as the first step in reducing the risk of ttis donor selection is usually conducted by a health history questionnaire to be completed by potential donors and a confidential interview the questions asked should be effective in assessing whether the respondents health status is suitable to donate and there is no tti risk factor people who are deferred should be counseled and given the reason for and duration of the deferral who has published a document titled blood donor selection -guidelines on assessing donor suitability for blood donation it recommends the following national donor selection guidelines and criteria should be based on epidemiological andor scientific evidence or where evidence is limited or lacking on best practice donor acceptance and deferral policies for the prevention of tti should be based on up-to-date information on the local epidemiology of infections the markers screened for the availability of suitable blood screening and confirmatory assays and the technologies in use national donor selection criteria should define conditions of acceptance and deferral for each criterion adequate resources including a sufficient number of qualified and trained staff should be made available for the consistent and reliable assessment of donor suitability for blood donation quality systems should be in place for donor selection including selection criteria staff training and documentation blood transfusion services should establish mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation to assess the implementation and effectiveness of donor selection criteria in conclusion pre-donation selection is essential to protect the safety and sufficiency of blood supply and safeguard the health of recipients and donors background blood components may be contaminated by a variety of commensal pathogenic or environmental bacteria during collection manufacture or storage the outcome of transfusion is dependent on the ability of the specific strain to multiply to clinically-relevant titers during storage the pathogenicity of the strain and the patients situation platelets in particular are stored in conditions conducive to bacterial growth and septic reactions to these products are the most frequently documented infectious risk of transfusion aim the objective of this update is to review estimates of risk of bacterial sepsis and contamination of platelets and recent findings describing interventions designed to safeguard patients methods this update will use recent reports and unpublished data to describe our current understanding of the role of bacteria in transfusion safety results historical data suggests that11-3000 platelet products are contaminated with bacteria and septic transfusion reactions occurred in 115-100000 transfusions clinical awareness of the danger and a 2004 aabb standard to limit and detect bacteria in platelet products have driven the development of safety systems the last decade has seen substantial progress in the implementation of optimal skin disinfection techniques and sample diversion strategies to reduce contamination and many centers implemented either bacterial culture testing or pathogen inactivation processes to reduce the risk culture testing can reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of exposure to contaminated components and sepsis the majority of contaminated products do not cause adverse reactions however at the time of collection and manufacture the only means to prevent serious and fatal reactions is to ensure that that the component is functionally sterile pathogen inactivation technologies show variable efficacy at killing bacteria suggesting a need for strict adherence to the manufacturers suggested protocols to ensure optimum performance alternatively assays performed on the day of transfusion prevent the transfusion of high concentrations of bacteria that are associated with the most severe adverse reactions conclusions bacterial contamination and sepsis remain the greatest infectious risks of transfusion enhanced testing or pathogen inactivation should be implemented to ensure patient safety the australian red cross blood service sydney australia background pathogen reduction technologies have been developed as a means of reducing the risk of transfusion transmission of blood-borne pathogens published literature indicates that systems currently in use or under development effectively inactivate a range of pathogens in platelets and plasma with the exception of some non-lipid enveloped viruses bacterial spores and prions development of pathogen reduction technology prt is ongoing and many countries have adopted prt as part of their routine blood component processing the aim of this update will be to review technologies currently in use or under development for treatment of labile blood components during processing the impact of prt on blood component quality as well as ongoing challenges will be reviewed platelets there are currently three systems for prt treatment of platelets these are the mirasol tm system terumobct the intercept blood system tm cerus corporation and the theraflex uvc tm system macopharma the intercept and mirasol systems are used widely in blood centres in europe asia and the middle east for the treatment of both platelets and plasma whereas clinical trials of platelets treated using the theraflex uvc system are ongoing in vitro data suggests prt treatment leads to some loss of platelet function however haemovigilance reports from sev-eral countries where intercept treated platelets are transfused indicate no change in component usage and indeed a reduction in transfusion related adverse events similarly there have been no reports to date of serious adverse events relating to clinical use of mirasol-treated platelets plasma the intercept and mirasol systems can be used to treat both plasma and platelets and the theraflex system utilises methylene blue mb with visible light for prt treatment of plasma there are some losses of coagulation factors following treatment with each of these systems theraflex mb plasma has been transfused world-wide since 1999 and haemovigilance data indicates there is not a higher incidence of allergic reactions or other adverse events with mb-treated plasma red cellswhole blood commercial prt systems for red cell or whole blood components are under development cerus corporation has continued development of a second-generation s-303 system for red cells demonstrating in vivo recovery after 35 days storage a mirasol prt system for treatment of whole blood is also being developed by terumobct preliminary in vitro quality and in vivo recovery and survival data indicate that this technology may eventually become available but further development and clinical trials are still required challenges concerns still exist regarding long term effects on patients receiving prt treated blood components particularly the potential toxic effects of residual products following photochemical treatment ongoing post-marketing surveillance and clinical trials are required to address these concerns ideally prt should provide proactive protection against emerging pathogens and reduce the need to introduce additional pathogen testing minimise bacterial contamination and potentially replace processing steps such as gamma irradiation the challenge for blood services is to understand and rationalise the costs risks and benefits of prt compared to removing any of these tests or processes whilst aiming to provide the highest level of blood safety steps in getting a paper publishedabstract accepted 1b-h4-01 no abstract available 1b-h4-02 how to get your abstract accepted and how to present it daniels g many abstracts are submitted to the isbt for presentation at international and regional congresses all abstracts are refereed by a large panel of international experts who decide which abstracts should be accepted and which ones should be rejected they also decide which of the accepted should be presented orally or as a poster most of the submitted abstracts are accepted though there is plenty of room for improvement in the quality of many of those abstracts in this session i will describe why some abstracts are rejected and discuss how you might avoid this pitfall i will also discuss some methods for improving your abstracts so that they represent the quality of the work you are describing and enhance the reputation of yourself and your institution once your abstract has been accepted you will have to present it at the congress if it is accepted for poster presentation you will have to make a poster the easiest way to produce a poster is to design it on a single powerpoint slide and then send the file to a company that will turn it into a poster on paper or even on cloth for easier transportation if your budget does not run to that there are cheaper ways such as printing it on single pages of a4 with the text printed in a very large font the best posters do not have too much written information bullet points are often best contain diagrams andor pictures and are colourful and visually attractive if however your abstract is accepted for oral presentation then you will have to give a talk usually of 10 min and then be prepared to answer questions this may be a daunting prospect especially if you are not experienced in public speaking and particularly if english is not your first language i will discuss techniques for improving your presentation skills both from the points of your spoken presentation and your visual aids which will usually be a powerpoint presentation if you are thoroughly prepared before you stand up in front of an audience you will feel more confident and consequently less nervous devine d publication of research findings and novel concepts in the biomedical literature is the mainstay of knowledge mobilization the communication of scientific work as papers follows a well-established framework a clear understanding of the nature of this framework and how to assess ones own work against it is critical to successful acceptance and subsequent publication of manuscripts in this session we will review the standard framework for scientific communication communicating your findings is a form of scientific story telling one must clearly explain why it was important to write the paper so that the reader will be interested and want to keep reading it generally an author must capture the interest of a potential reader right at the abstract which is sometimes the only way a reader sees the paper if they have discovered the work using a search engine such as medline in the main body of the paper the author must clearly explain how the study was designed and carried out with careful attention paid to any important details and to the statistical analysis if appropriate results must be presented in a manner that is clear and easily interpreted by the reader then the work should be discussed in the context of other work in the area emphasizing the novel findings in this session we will also address the following questions how do i know if i have enough information to write a paper where should i try to publish the paper how should my paper be put together to give it the best chance of being accepted what happens to my paper after i submit it if it is returned to me with comments from the reviewers what should i do what is my next step if my paper is rejected either without review or with review we will also consider how to prepare papers in a language other than ones native language the various sorts of scientific communications original papers review articles reports letters to the editor will be discussed the session is intended to provide general guidance for the publication of papers in the biomedical literature rather than be specifically focused on publication in the societys journal vox sanguinis the membership survey commissioned by the isbt central office in 2012 gave a good insight into what members and non-members expect from the society the main message was that members and potential members would like more educational and training resources to be available many respondents requested that isbt should write international guidelines and develop standards developing international guidelines when so many are already available and when countries and regions have different requirements would be a titanic task the isbt board decided that the society should put together a repository library of guidelines standards and regulatory documents that are already currently available the repository is now ready and launched during the 24th regional congress of the isbt in kuala lumpur for practical purposes the repository contains recent guidelines in the english language that are freely available however following consultation with experts some manuals are included that are either relatively old or are not yet freely available on line approximately 250 documents are in the repository from around 25 countries the repository is a work in progress and further documents will be added in other languages the repository is available via a link on the isbt home page wwwisbtweborg to the isbt academy e-learning portal it can be accessed by country and by subject and a search facility is available the guidelines are organised by six main subjects donor clinical laboratory qualityhaemovigilance processing and regulatory there are sub topics for each main subject isbt anticipates that you will find the repository a useful resource background blood services in africa operate at different levels of development from those comparable to the first world to those operating at a basic level with just hospital based blood banks and no national coordination in recent years countries have made efforts to improve their blood services based on voluntary non-remunerated blood donation major challenges include low knowledge levels inadequate funding weak regulatory framework and poor quality systems many international standards are too stringent for most economies in sub-saharan africa to address these challenges the africa society for blood transfusion afsbt started a program to develop blood transfusion standards relevant to africa the afsbt step-wise accreditation standards these standards were drafted by an afsbt task team for accreditation with guidance from the aabb and input from a team of experts they were initially based on the who aide memoire for blood safety an evidence-based decision-making process where possible was used to modify existing requirements or create new specific requirements the goal of the standards is to provide a benchmark for accreditation of facilities and to maintain and enhance the quality and safety of blood transfusion in africa the development process started in 2009 there is one standard with 3 progressively more rigorous steps of achievement as follows level 1 minimum quality and operational requirements level 2 intermediate quality and operational requirements level 3 full accreditation at international standard a facility chooses the level to be assessed at however accreditation at any grade is attained if facilities meet standards of the grade but also comply with specific requirements in section 11 which deals with legal and regulatory requirements blood supply equipment and supplies and clinical use of blood and blood products application of the standards they apply to facilities that perform any or all of the following functions mobilization recruitment and selection of blood donors blood collection components preparation blood group and serological testing compatibility testing storage handling transportation and distribution of blood products requirements do not apply in cases where the blood transfusion service is not responsible for an activity eg compatibility testing guidance document there is a guidance document which clarifies and enhances understanding of the requirements of some of the standards other standards are straight forward and do not need guidance the guidance document is being updated as queries are received from the field training to facilitate meeting the requirements of the standards there is a training committee tasked with supporting training for blood services a full training program is currently being developed piloting the standards were piloted in namibia and malawi the namibia piloting was completed in 2012 while the malawi piloting will be completed in 2013 comments from these pilot sites have provided valuable input into the standards development process conclusion stepwise accreditation program is relevant in encouraging improvements for developing blood transfusion services accreditation standards need to be commensurate with local needs training is very important in helping developing blood transfusion services attain accreditation status blood transfusion has become an integral part of modern healthcare when it is required it is an essential element of therapy helps safe lives and improves quality of life however it is not without risk being of human tissue origin this risk is related to its source as well as the process involved in its provision to ensure that blood transfusion is safe and does not cause harm to patients these risks have to be monitored evaluated and managed appropriately therefore it is essential to develop system of ensuring safe blood supply and safe transfusion quality systems should be developed covering the whole transfusion chain policies standards and guidelines are important tools to ensure that the system is effective there are various mechanisms to monitor evaluate and analyse in order to bring about improvement these include developing indicators quality and clinical or transfusion audits quality assessment programmes and haemovigilance programme indicators can be used to monitor transfusion practice such as prevalence of transfusion transmitted disease among blood donors crossmatch transfusion ratio expiry fate of blood components and transfusion error these indicators not only measure safety but also efficiency of the blood service in countries where the blood supply is not consistent the rate of blood requirement not met is an important indicator to monitor performance of laboratories providing blood can be measured using quality assessment programmes this is an important element that links the source of blood to the patient audits covering all processes and procedures ensure that the quality and safety of blood is maintained while these processes and procedures are controlled in ensuring safety and quality of the blood supply the process involved in the transfusion process is sometimes not controlled by documented procedures and poorly supervised auditing blood usage which is more complex and laborious provides an important mechanism for ensuring that this precious national resource is utilised efficiently guidelines whether national or international are required against which these audits are performed transfusion audits looks at the quality of care of patients besides the use of blood it analyses the process of diagnosis the decision making in treatment and the use of available resources over the last two decades haemovigilance has evolved and expanded worldwide it focuses on adverse events that occurred throughout the transfusion chain analysis of the facts and provide an avenue for corrective actions to be taken to prevent further recurrence initially its focus was more on adverse events that occurred to patients it is now used to monitor adverse events relating to blood donors and blood donating process in resource limited economies these tools can be used effectively when a stepwise approach is adopted the aim is to create a culture of professionalism in delivering quality of care to patient with efficient use of available resources however its benefit can be extended to influence change and improvement in healthcare in general only when deficiencies are demonstrated that request for resources can be shown to be justified serological methods have the advantage of being fast simple and determining the expression of antigens directly however genotyping and molecular diagnostic methods have their advantages in determining subtypes and variants as well as in detecting other rare blood groups commercial blood group genotyping kits have been widely used not only in clinical blood banks but also in transfusion services these commercial kits mainly aim to analyze coding genes of abo and rh blood group systems common alleles found in local populations are included in these kits at present many kinds of molecular diagnostic methods are employed in detecting blood group alleles by transfusion laboratories in china these methods include multiplex pcr multiplex pcr combined with pool system sequencing and gene chip technology considering the genetic background of several rare phenotypes with clinical importance in chinese persons one multiplex pcr system was developed to detect fy a  s and ok a antigens and the other system was developed to detect di b  k and js b antigens using the existing multiplex pcr-ssp assays only one sample can be detected in a single pcr tube because the primers used in these assays are specifically devised for corresponding high-frequency alleles and aim to screen for the negative results therefore the positive results would mask the negative results by adding more samples in one pcr tube to improve the efficiency of screening recently we established a novel method combining the multiplex pcr-ssp assays with the dna pooling strategy the primers were designed to amplify the corresponding low-frequency snp sites in each multiplex pcr-ssp assay every dna pool is tested for the presence of the low-frequency snp sites a pool is released for further processing when the positive results were found in any site after then each individual dna sample of the positive pool was detected respectively to determine the positive sample finally pcr-ssp methods were used to determine whether the positive result was caused by homozygous or heterozygous alleles normally the homozygous low-frequency alleles would lead to rare phenotypes at the same time the control system based on site-directed mutagenesis solves the problem of the lack of experiment controls due to unavailable negative or positive dna control samples with large scale screening of population samples and diagnosis of various clinical special samples the relationship between blood group coding genes and the expression of proteins is being clear the frequency of multiple blood group alleles has also been investigated the specific molecular events found in asians and chinese populations are revealing the difference among races and regions as well as the expression diversity of blood group alleles 1c-h6-02 diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia autoimmune haemolytic anaemia aiha occurs as a result of antibodies directed against self-red blood cell rbc antigens leading to the premature destruction of rbc rbc destruction may occur within the vasculature often mediated by the membrane-lysing complex which is generated upon complement activation or occur extravascularly within the reticulo-endothelial system that expresses fcr and c3 receptors that bind antibody and complement coated rbc the laboratory hallmark of aiha is a positive direct antiglobulin test dat although it has to be recognized that occasional cases of dat-negative aiha may occur secondary causes for aiha such as an underlying autoimmune disorder infections or malignancies should be considered as part of the investigation process for aiha immunohaematology investigations for aiha should always include a dat using monospecific anti-igg and anti-c3d on occasions further testing with anti-iga or -igg subtypes may be necessary while the dat provides information on bound rbc antibodies the indirect antiglobulin test iat using screening and antibody identification cells will provide information on the specificity of circulating antibodies often this will give a pan-reactive pattern although it is not unusual to identify coincident autoantibodies with defined red cell specificity negative iat with screening and identification cells in the presence of a positive dat should raise suspicion of drug-induced aiha in patients who may have been potentially alloimmunized further procedures should be performed to exclude the coincident presence of alloantibodies as failure to recognize alloantibodies may result in an immediate or delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction if red cell transfusions are initiated elution and auto-or alloadsorbtion techniques are useful to separate allo-and autoantibodies complete red cell phenotyping should be concurrently performed to aid in identifying antibody specificities heavily antibody-coated red cells may be difficult to phenotype with some anti-sera in which case molecular based red cell genotyping should be initiated molecular based red cell typing is also particularly useful where the patient has recently been transfused and the initial red cell phenotype of the patient is not known the primary management of the patient with aiha is amelioration of the underlying condition and suppression of immune mediated haemolysis this is usually achieved with administration of steroids or immunosuppressive agents splenectomy may be an effective second line treatment rituximab is increasingly becoming a promising treatment option in patients who are steroid-refractory and not suitable for splenectomy other treatment modalities for the refractory patient include intravenous immunoglobulin and danazol red cell transfusions in patients with aiha should be undertaken carefully although they should never be denied blood transfusions because of inability to find compatible units as far as possible phenotype matched red cells cross-match compatible with the patients autoadsorbed serum should be transfused if coincident alloantibodies are identified antigen-negative red cells will need to be selected clinical immunology and transfusion medicine university  regional laboratories lund sweden what is the value of discussing case studies they provide us with a forum for sharing our combined experience and permit the development of ideas and techniques as well as the possibility to see a given situation from another perspective cases that illustrate the following will be discussed 1 the presence of polyagglutination in a patient with a bacterial infection in europe and the usa polyagglutination is rarely seen since monoclonal blood grouping reagents are the norm however across asia a broad spectrum of blood typing reagents are used and polyagglutination maybe encountered 2 investigation of an antibody to a low-prevalence antigen in a case of haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn antibodies to low-prevalence antigens occur not infrequently how can they be investigated and what should be considered 3 antibodies to a high-prevalence antigen the discussion will consider how to resolve such a case in laboratories with different levels of resources what should be considered in different clinical situations the goal is provide useful tips for investigation of difficult serological cases and information on how to proceed when the investigation is beyond the resources of the laboratory haemovigilance is an important element of blood safety it aims to identify monitor and prevent adverse reactions incidents and adverse events related to transfusion for both donors and patients from vein to vein various local regional and national haemovigilance models exist which reflect the range of health systems and blood systems in different countries for example some haemovigilance systems are coordinated by professional bodies some by blood suppliers and some by health authorities health departments or regulators participation may be voluntary or mandatory and may differ depending on whether all events or only serious ones are reportable some systems capture events with all levels of imputability whereas others record only those which are confirmed or highly probable near miss events are captured by some systems and many valuable lessons can be learned from these cases from an early stage of haemovigilance reporting it has been identified that processrelated problems are a major cause of serious transfusion complications these include incorrect blood component transfused events where the blood component was intended for another recipient frequently due to errors in patient identification at the time of collection of the pre-transfusion sample or at the time of bedside administration or did not meet the patients special needs such as a patient with a red cell antibody who did not receive the required antigen-negative unit human and system factors such as lack of awareness or training working environment interruptions and inadequate communications between clinical teams or between the clinical teams and the transfusion laboratory are very important contributors to these events investigation of transfusion reactions incidents and events at the hospital level is essential to identify clinical consequences contributing factors and to develop and implement plans to prevent recurrence reportable incidents should be notified to the haemovigilance programme transfusion safety officers transfusion nurses and similar roles have been introduced in many countries and they play important roles in haemovigilance especially at the hospital level adequate medical and transfusion laboratory support for hospital haemovigilance activities is also essential for success hospital transfusion committees should oversee haemovigilance activities and reporting and should ensure that hospital senior management is aware of and responds to serious reactions and events especially where systems issues are identified to be contributory at an international level isbts working party on haemovigilance brings together isbt members with an interest in haemovigilance isbt works closely with ihn an international collaboration of regional or national haemovigilance programmes and other partners ihn operates the istare database for international data sharing and benchmarking haemovigilance reporting can identify priority areas for action either where the events have serious clinical consequences andor occur frequently and can help identify and monitor the implementation of solutions an important feature of haemovigilance programs is the sharing of experiences and results haemovigilance reports can both provide valuable feedback to clinical teams and hospitals locally as well as share experiences nationally and internationally to improve patient outcomes wiersum-osselton jc trip national hemo-and biovigilance office the hague the netherlands background haemovigilance systems capture data on adverse reactions and infections in recipients of blood transfusions as well as on errors and incidents in the transfusion chain the objective is to analyse them and make recommendations for improving transfusion safety many haemovigilance systems also collect data on complications in blood donors with a view to monitoring and improving blood donor safety standardised definitions are necessary for classifying and comparing data in all these domains and at all levels method since 2004 at international meetings of blood transfusion professionals members the international haemovigilance network ihn and the haemovigilance working party of the international society for blood transfusion isbt have collaborated in developing and validating definitions for non-infectious transfusion complications errors and incidents in the transfusion chain as well as adverse reactions in blood donors from 2012 contacts with other groups including the who have been put in place to ensure wide consultation as well as awareness and use of the definitions results standardised definitions have been published for recipient adverse reactions for complications of blood donation and for a limited number of types of incident in the transfusion chain the isbt haemovigilance working party and ihn are committed to ensuring that the definitions remain up-to-date and that revisions and improvements are conducted with wide consultation of professionals in relevant organisations worldwide the haemovigilance working party and working party on transfusion-transmitted infections are collaborating on the development of definitions and criteria for assessing suspected transfusion-transmitted infections conclusion internationally agreed definitions are available for registration and surveillance of complications of blood donation and most types of adverse reaction in patients receiving blood transfusions for errors and incidents in the transfusion chain further work is necessary to improve comparability of data between hemovigilance systems 1d-h7-03 distler pb and ashford p critical to patient safety is the capability of rapidly tracing a medical product of human origin mpho from donor to recipient and vice versa traceability requires that each product be uniquely identified in order to provide a clear unambiguous path historically uniqueness was defined only in the context of a single organization for example a blood product identifier was unique only to the blood bank that assigned it because some medical products of human origin mpho especially cells and tissues are frequently distributed across international borders it is becoming increasingly important that identifiers of mpho need to be unique not only within an organization but globally as well in 2010 the world health assembly urged member states to encourage the implementation of globally consistent coding systems for human cells tissues and organs as such in order to facilitate national and international traceability of materials of human origin for transplantation more recently who has recognized the need for common strategies for global governance of all mhpo including the global use of isbt 128 to ensure unique identification optimal traceability and interoperability between countries and across all mpho for both routine and emergency use this requires a globally consistent coding system that can provide a mechanism to allow distinct items to be uniquely identified and consistently characterized to all participants within the system the means to allocate identifiers in a manner that avoids duplication and the information infrastructure on which effective traceability can be built isbt 128 is an international terminology coding and labelling system that supports the assignment of unique identifiers to support global traceability of mpho it is currently in use by many blood banks tissue banks and cellular therapy facilities around the world and the who global forum on blood safety has recognized promotion of the use of isbt 128 as a priority for action in improving quality management and haemovigilance 1d-h8-01 the university of tokyo tokyo japan antibodies directed to human platelet antigens hpa play important roles in the pathogenesis of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia nait platelet transfusion refractoriness ptr and post-transfusion purpura ptp presently six hpa biallelic systems namely hpa-1 to -5 and -15 which are involved in immune mediated thrombocytopenia are characterized there are important ethnic differences in the frequency distribution of these hpa systems the incompatibility of the hpa-1 system being the mostly involved in thrombocytopenic conditions in caucasian whereas in japanese the hpa-4 system is the mostly involved the frequency distribution of hpa systems reported in other parts of asia seems to be different from caucasian as well as japanese especially related to hpa-1 and -4 respectively in addition to hpa antibodies to human leukocyte antigen hla blood group abo and human neutrophil antigens hna have also been shown to be involved in immune mediated thrombocytopenia in fact the majority of the cases of ptr are dependent on anti-hla antibodies and anti-hpa antibodies comprise only a small proportion the identification of the causative antibody is very important for the implementation of preventivetherapeutic measures for ptr such as the selection of hla-andor hpa-compatible platelets on the other hand the involvement of anti-hla antibodies in the pathogenesis of nait is questioned but cases in which the causative antibody cannot be determined still remain relatively high thus for the implementation of preventive and therapeutic measures for the immune mediated thrombocytopenia the detection and identification of the causative antibody is essential the standard methods applied varies among the regions the monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of platelet antigens maipa and the platelet immunofluorescence test pfit being the preferred methods in the us and europe whereas in japan the mixed-passive hemagglutination is the most applied one neither of the methods alone however is able to detect all the clinically significant antibodies thus improvement of the available methods as well as the development of new technologies is required considering the ethnical differences of the hpa frequency distribution we considered important to develop the research of this field also in asia and for this purpose the isbt platelet immunobiology working party asia regional isbt piwp-ar was launched in 2010 during the xxxist international congress of the isbt in berlin which aims the sharing of knowledge and improvement of technology in asia a training course on platelet immunology methods and genotyping was provided in tokyo in 2010 and the first workshop of the piwp-ar was organized in taipei in 2011 in may 2013 the second training course on platelet immunology methods and genotyping was organized in guangzhou china and the 2nd workshop of the piwp-ar is going to be held in kuala lumpur malaysia during the 24th regional congress of the isbt the presently available methods for the antigenantibody testing the problems related with antibody detection and the activities of the platelet working party will be presented nanning institute of transfusion medicine nanning china background immunization against human platelet antigens hpa is associated with a number of clinical syndromes including neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia nait platelet transfusion refractoriness ptr post-transfusion purpura ptp and other platelet immune disorders the detection and identification of the clinical relevant platelet antibodies are important for the diagnosis and management of the affected patients with immune thrombocytopenia aims the aims of this study is to investigate the characteristic of the detection of clinical relevant platelet antibodies in the asian population and to evaluate the ability for the detection and identification of platelet antibodies in the platelet immunology laboratories in asian countries methods total of 378 cases that were diagnosed and studied as naitp 70 ptr 305 and ptp 3 in asian platelet immunology laboratories were reviewed of the 378 cases 167 were japanese in japan 142 were chinese in china 30 were in india 24 were chinese in taiwan china 5 were in south korea 4 were in thailand 3 were in kuwait and 1 case each for oman lebanese and palestinian the specificities of platelet antibodies in these cases were investigated and compared with the data from western countrys laboratories the methodology of detection and identification of antiplatelet antibodies in asian labs were also reviewed results among 378 cases the immune thrombocytopenia associated antiplatelet antibodies were two cases of anti-hpa-1in kuwait 2 of anti-hpa-2 1 in china and 1 in japan 5 of anti-hpa-3 three in japan one in china and one in taiwan china 5 of anti-hpa-4 all in japan 4 of anti-hpa-5 1 in china and 3 in japan 1 of anti-hpa-7newantihit a in japan 1 of anti-hpa-15 in japan 2 of anti-hpa-21bw in japan 309 of anti-hla101 in china 147 in japan 5 in korea3 in thailand 23 in taiwan china and 30 in india 1 of anti-a in japan as well as 15 cases of anti-cd36nak a  isoantibody eight in china three in japan and one case each in thailand oman lebanese and palestinian thirty one cases of antibodies could not find the specificities 30 in china and 1 in kuwait the methods of detection and identification of antiplatelet antibody such as monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens maipa mixed passive hemagglutination mpha assay platelet immunofluorescence test pift modified antigen capture elisa mace and solid phase red cell adherence spaa have been used in asian laboratories summaryconclusions platelet alloantibodies are found with variable frequencies in different ethnic groups in asian population anti-hpa-4 is mainly found in japanese individuals while anti-cd36 nak a  isoantibody that occurred in cd36 type i deficient individuals is most frequent found in asian population especially in chinese population only two cases of anti-hpa-1 antibodies were found in asian population all in kuwait while anti-hpa-1 is the most frequent antibody associated with severe complications in caucasian populations however anti-cd36 isoantibody is of a risk factor of immune thrombocytopenia in asian population as the incidence of cd36 deficiency is 3-11 the human platelet antigens hpa are a group of polymorphic antigens expressed relatively specific on platelets capable of eliciting an immunological response with development of alloantibodies hpa directed alloantibodies have been implicated in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia nait post-transfusion purpura and refractoriness to platelet transfusions twenty-seven hpa are recognized of which antibodies to both the given alloantigen and the antithetical alloantigen has been reported for hpa-1 to 5 and hpa-15 the remaining hpa are designated with a w as an alloantibody to the antithetical antigen has yet to be reported most hpa polymorphisms are a result of a mis-sense single nucleotide alteration and are readily detectable using standard molecular typing methods dna based population wide genotyping have revealed considerable variation in hpa allele frequencies among different ethnic groups the b forms of hpa-1 -2 -3 and -5 are common among caucasians while hpa-4b is extremely rare in the chinese however hpa-1b is extremely rare while uncommon in malays hpa-4b and hpa-21bw meanwhile are more commonly seen among asians compared to caucasians consequent to this alloanti-hpa-4b is the most common cause for nait in the asian population as compared to alloanti-hpa-1a among caucasians several cases of nait due to anti-hpa-21bw have also been reported in asia in contrast nait due to anti-hpa-6b is rare despite the alloantigen being more common among asians although platelet transfusion refractoriness is more commonly associated with hla antibodies anti-hpa antibodies have been implicated in some cases management of nait and platelet transfusion refractoriness include the supply of antigen negative platelet units a platelet donor registry with a critical mass of hla and hpa typed blood donors is therefore necessary for effective management of these conditions ready availability of low-cost high-throughput snp genotyping platforms allow for establishment of large hpa genotyped donor pools knowledge of hpa genotype prevalence in the local population as well as its implications on nait and platelet refractoriness is however crucial before deciding on donor screening strategies careful considerations would also need to be made with regards to the cost-effectiveness of such ventures in light of alternative management strategies and local incidence rates of nait clinical -improving patient outcomes 2a-s01-01 setting up a patient blood management programme wood e 1  engelbrecht s 12 and robinson k 2 1 transfusion research unit monash university melbourne australia 2 australian red cross blood service adelaide australia patient blood management pbm aims to minimise unnecessary transfusions and also to ensure that if transfusion is required it is managed appropriatelyby individualising care so that patients receive what they need when they need it pbm is comprehensive and patient-centred with active participation by patients and a multidisciplinary approach from the hospital team to achieving these aims three pillars of pbm have been suggested to optimise a patients red cell mass reduce bleeding and improve tolerance of anaemia in the perioperative setting important elements of pbm include attention to medical surgical and anaesthetic interventions and techniques to improve haemostasis and reduce blood loss where significant intraoperative blood loss is anticipated use of cell salvage techniques can be very valuable pbm concepts also apply outside the perioperative setting and the broad principles can be applied to a wide range of clinical settings including obstetrics trauma critical care and haematologyoncology and other medical settings eg gastroenterology an effective hospital pbm programme requires planning and communication with a stepby-step approach to implementation identifying priority areas for action engagement education and training of staff and on-going monitoring against plans to demonstrate progress and identify areas for improvement feedback to staff on progress provides a sense of achievement and helps engagement adequate resources are required including from medical nursing and laboratory staff from a range of disciplines who have important contributions to make in clinical practice education and training and audit and review minimisation of unnecessary transfusions saves money for hospitals and the community and other resources such as staff time and therefore offsets the costs of establishing and maintaining a pbm programme effective implementation requires change at individual and organizational levels and therefore support of hospital executive management local health authorities and the blood supplier are also very valuable oversight of the program can be by the hospital transfusion committee or a pbm programme committee but the particular structure and governance arrangements should be developed to suit local needs general practitioners can play key roles in preparing patients for surgery by identification and management of anaemia as well as other pbm activities ultimately an effective pbm programme can optimise care and outcomes for patients make better use of limited and precious blood supplies and reduce risks and costs trauma is a leading cause of death around the world with haemorrhage accounting for more than a third of the preventable mortality with the majority of these deaths occurring within the initial 24 h massive blood transfusion is generally defined as the replacement bytransfusion of more than 10 units of red cells over 24 h massive transfusionprotocols mtps have evolved over the past decade and are especially importantin facilitating the early delivery of copious amounts of blood products topatients who have major injuries and severe haemorrhage various studies havealso demonstrated that with mtps there is a more efficient use and lesswastage of blood products however for trauma patients stopping thehaemorrhage and resuscitating the patient does not only involve the expedientdelivery of red cells to the injured patient mtps have also emphasized theneed for a more balanced ratio of delivery of blood products includingplatelets and plasma to patients who sustain massive blood loss and havedeveloped acute traumatic coagulopathy atc often times mtps also stress theimportance of the consideration of use of haemostatic adjuncts such astranexamic acid activated factor vii level one transfusion units and the useof blood warmers to reverse the potential effects of hypothermia with sustainedtransfusions of large amounts of blood products ultimately in tandem withdamage control resuscitation which allows permissive hypotension whilstsecuring haemostasis mtps have been shown to also improve survival of theseseverely injured patients a more recent paper describes the development of amassive haemorrhage protocol to aid in the identification of patients who wouldbenefit from the mtp and this may be the next step in the evolution of a workprocess by which resuscitation for severely injured patients may be optimized background rh blood group antigens are highly immunogenic and transfusion of rh d positive blood in rh d negative recipients is avoided platelets do not express rh antigens however they may contain significant amount of contaminating red cells to illicit an immune response in the patient due to limited shelf life of platelets and inventory issues rh d positive platelets which are not visibly contaminated with red blood cells maybe transfused to rh d negative patients including children and females of child bearing age there has been increased focus on whether rh immunoglobulin should be routinely administered after such transfusions in saudi arabia no clear guidelines exist on the administration of rh immunoglobulin after d positive transfusions in d negative patients aim the purpose of this study was to determine whether the transfusion of rh d positive platelets to patients who are rh d negative results in d alloimmunization and whether rh immunoglobulin should be routinely administered in such patients methods eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study included the following transfusion of rh d positive platelets no anti d detectable before transfusion no previous exposure to rh d positive blood components and results of follow-up testing of anti-d in patients serum available the patients blood group and antibody screening was done using liss-iat gel technology diamed results one hundred rh d negative patients who received rh d positive blood components were identified out of this 63 63 patients received rh d positive platelet transfusions in 47 74 patients out of this the results for post transfusion antibody screening were available the mean age of the patients was 465 years and included 30 males and 17 females average number of rh d positive platelets transfused per patient was 113 units and total number of platelet units transfused was 523 anti d was detectable in 4 85 patients post transfusion and included one male and three female patients of the female patients one was a 3 year old child who received 50 units of random donor platelets and second a 21 year old women who presented in the emergency department as a case of trauma the third female was 54 year old post-menopausal woman conclusion we conclude that the chances of developing d alloimmunization after receiving rh d positive platelets is generally low however keeping in view the antenatal complications which can arise in the future in females due to this alloimmunization it is highly recommended that rh immunoglobulin be administered to all rh d negative women in the reproductive age group and female children who receive rh d positive platelets background hemovigilance is a quality process which takes into account all the activities of a blood transfusion chain with the aim to improve quality and enhance safety of blood transfusion we have implemented a transfusion feedback reporting mechanism in our hospital as a part of hemovigilance the current study aims to collect and analyze this data to improve our transfusion system aim to systematically analyze the transfusion process from issue of blood components to completion of the transfusion material and methods the transfusion feedback forms received back at the transfusion medicine department during a 3 months period were systematically analyzed for documentation related to patient identification product identification documentation completeness etc results were analyzed statistically for specific co-relation with patients location time of transfusion and type of component transfused results of 3474 blood components were issued during the study period

blood bank during the same period were 2 of 553 2765 transfusions were carried out during non routine work hours the mean time between the issue of the components and start of transfusion was 28 min for rbc components 21 min for platelets and 16 min for ffp patient identification and monitoring and product identification related non-compliances significantly correlated with out of routine transfusions p  0002 conclusion though overall compliance with established procedure for transfusion was evident activities related to unit identification patient monitoring and identification and reporting of adverse reactions were not well documented this emphasizes the need for ongoing training of nursing staff and medical doctors in safe blood administration practices introduction and

better and to costs comparable to serology consequently genotyping kell kidd and duffy instead of routinely performing a second round of serotyping as mandatory for donors in switzerland is recommended ahead of comparable suggestions with regard to rh and mnss a more detailed statistical analysis of existing raw data is needed however genetically identified donors with rare blood phenotypes eg such as ytab are already selected for respective transfusions and are a strong indicator for the value of the presented project the serological data suggest that retention of the 208-210 tcc 51s in glycophorin bs codon from the gypb pseudoexon prior to the gene conversion insertion of gypa sequence and coding for serine in the hybrid glycophorin is the basis of anek-like activity for both hybrid glycophorins it should be considered that these antisera react with a new kipp-related mns system antigen genetic studies revealed the same crossover for gpkipp and gpyak that have been independently reported in conference abstracts suggesting that these are in fact the same hybrid glycophorin background with the increasing knowledge of the genetics of blood group antigens molecular immunohaematology is gaining popularity molecular immunohaematology refers to the use of genotyping to encode red blood cell antigens representing an indirect method used to predict ones phenotype there are certain advantages of genotyping namely typing of red blood cells with autoantibodies prenatal testing and patients with multiple transfusions molecular methods are also useful in phenotyping donors as it enables the prediction of numerous phenotypes in one single test however there are several misgivings about the cost of molecular methods used to genotype antigens aim to evaluate and compare the cost of conventional serological phenotyping and molecular genotyping methods a batch of 30 donor samples was typed using both serological and molecular methods the test kit used for molecular methods from gen-probe included the typing for the following antigens -kell k k kpa kpb kpc jsa and jsb kidd -jka jkb jk duffy fya fyb fyx fygatasil  mns m n s s s-s-uvar rh c c e e and dombrock doa dob negatives that are obtained using this method were confirmed using serology serological typing was performed with available antisera according to the various manufacturers instructions this includes kell k k kidd jka jkb duffy fya fyb mns m n s s and rh c c e e the cost for the different tests were tabulated and compared the cost includes labour consumables and equipments results the results show that molecular method of typing red blood cells is more expensive than the traditional serological method the cost of consumables is comparable for both methods the consumables make up about 80 of the total cost for serological methods and about 82 for molecular methods the cost of labour is about 9 for serological methods and 1 for molecular equipment cost contributes to 1 of the cost using serological methods and about 14 using molecular methods conclusion molecular methods may seem more expensive about two times the cost of serology but results are obtained faster and are less labour intensive which could prove to be an advantage when phenotyping samples in large quantities especially for donor phenotyping molecular immunohaematology is a relatively new process thus kits for these methods are expensive at the moment as development and adoption of genotyping progresses consumables and equipment costs are expected to become more affordable serological methods do have their limitations even for patient testing especially for patients with autoantibodies and patients who have had multiple transfusions molecular methods may serve useful in overcoming these limitations background transfusion dependant patients often develop multiple antibodies to red cell antigens on exposure to red cells and require antigen-negative red blood cells for further transfusions finding suitable red cell units for such patients is often difficult and time consuming requiring phenotyping of large numbers of red cell units in inventory the increasing cost and scarcity of anti-sera also makes this an expensive exercise aim in order to improve provision of phenotype-matched blood for such patients we studied the feasibility of large-scale snp-based genotyping of common blood groups for establishment of an antigen-negative red blood cell inventory methods genomic dna was extracted from donor blood samples using an automated platform samples were subjected to snp-typing for common local polymorphisms of rhce ccee fy fy a fy b  jk jk a jk b  mns ss and co co a co b  using taqman  snp genotyping assays in 384-well plates at 5 ll final reaction volume on a lightcy-clerii 480 real-time instrument identification of the cc polymorphism was by probes targeted to the 48cg and 307tc of the rhce allele while probes targeted to 676cg was utilised for ee detection for the remaining alleles probes were designed only to detect the most common mutation for the polymorphism within an east-asian population results were analysed and integrated into the blood donor software system results the 48cg probe designed for identification of c was unsuccessful with poor discrimination between genotype calls the remaining probes showed satisfactory discrimination between genotypes with 462 of the 505 91 samples analysed fully genotyped for the five alleles studied relatively rare genotypes were successfully identified using this strategy ccee 15505 30 fya-fyb 19505 38 ss 5505 10 the co2 allele responsible for co b was identified in the heterozygous state in four of 494 evaluable samples giving an allele frequency of 04 in our population the estimated reagent and consumables cost for sample dna preparation and snp testing was usd1200 compared to usd2715 for phenotyping using commercial anti-sera we did not factor in the cost of capital acquisition of instruments for genotyping as we used facilities which were common for other molecular tests in the hospital conclusions results of this study indicate that snp genotyping would be a costeffective strategy for screening and establishment of an antigen-negative red cell inventory and genotyped whole blood donor pool the cost of genotype screening was effectively reduced by use of small final reaction volume and extensive use of automation in addition genotyping allowed us to identify local prevalence of blood groups which were previously unidentifiable due to lack of commercially available anti-sera background over the past 20 years the molecular biochemical and serological basis of almost all blood groups have been determined highlighting the different frequencies of antigen related to different ethnic groups since october 2012 in our transfusion center asl caserta in order to have a blood bank that ensures the different transfusion needs extended erythrocyte typing is practiced on periodic donors with specific features such as age group and rh phenotype aims the aim of our study was to test the validity of the molecular method of erthrocyte phenotype typing with the serological technique by comparing the results obtained by each procedure we also compared each method in regards to reliability ease of use and reproducibility of results methods we selected 250 donors aged 45 years old group o and a rh homozygous phenotype samples from each patient were tested by serological typing in solid phase capture r immucor and then dna was extracted and each sample was tested by molecular typing in microarray bioarray solutions immucor results see table 1  table 1  summaryconclusions the results show that the frequencies of more immunogenic antigens k fya jka reflect the specific and ethnic frequencies of the donors we emphasise the absence of donors having an antigenic structure that is defined as rare that is present with a frequency of 11000 according to american rare donor program ardp council of europe international donor panel idp international society of blood transfusion isbt council of europe japanese red cross we only found one case of a donor expressing weak fyb which is due to mutation in fy 265c t the results were confirmed in 996 of cases by serological technique however for the phenotype fyb weak the result was discordant in serology where the result was fyb- in conclusion we can confirm the validity and the need to use both techniques in order to obtain a reliable and reproducible result the molecular technique is able to identify mutations in particular genes especially in specificity whilst the serological technique excels in sensitivity and speed but fails to confirm the data obtained background pathogen inactivation of blood components promises a new layer of transfusion safety enhancing existing strategies and providing proactive protection against emerging infectious risks processes for plasma and platelets are well established in many blood centers and those for red cells and whole blood are in development clinical acceptance of new technologies depends on the demonstration of product safety a minimal effect on product efficacy both in vitro and in vivo and the range and degree of pathogens inactivated aims to review the major processes of pathogen inactivation of plasma and cellular blood components with a focus on the range and degree of inactivation of relevant pathogens especially with regards to platelet pathogen inactivation methods this review will use recent reports and unpublished data to describe our current understanding of the potential efficacy of pathogen inactivation in improving transfusion safety results the major indication for platelet pathogen inactivation is bacterial contamination a persistent problem despite multiple innovations to minimize and detect contamination pathogen inactivation processes need to cover a wide range of possible bacterial concentrations and species there have been few published reports using the current commercially available systems optimized in vitro testing documents the ability of the terumo bct mirasol tm  cerus intercept tm and macopharma theraflex tm uv systems to effect a 10 2 -10 6 log reduction of various bacterial species most systems are less effective at inactivating bacterial spores a particular problem as bacillus spp is common platelet contaminant testing the level of pathogen inactivation under clinical conditions at very low and high concentrations of bacteria reveals further weaknesses in pathogen inactivation strategies conclusions clinical trials of pathogen inactivated platelets have focused on the safety and clinical efficacy of pathogen inactivated treated platelets but little has been reported on the efficacy of pathogen inactivation to reduce the risk of infection transmission blood centers should focus on this aspect of efficacy as they decide whether to implement and to favor those commercially available systems that best meets the clinical need for pathogen protection for pathogen inactivation pi using amotosalen and uva light induces the formation of covalent adducts and interstrand crosslinks between amotosalen and nucleic acids thus preventing dna replication and rna translation pi technology has been adopted into routine use in some european countries and is under fda review for licensure in the us current documentation of pi efficacy relies on illuminator sensors that measure the uva light dose delivered an indirect methodology is utilized for the validation and qc of the process in some centers that measures the amount of amotosalen consumed during illumination in platelets and before removal with the compound removal device the amotosalen remaining is a direct measurement of the uva light delivered and photochemical conversion of amotosalen however a functional qc method that measures a direct target within the treated blood product has not been introduced into clinical use residual leukocytes platelets and potentially plasma contain mitochondrial dna mtdna which is a collateral target of the pi process aims the goal of this study was to quantify the impact of intercept treatment on platelet-derived mtdna by real-time pcr methods to evaluate the feasibility of detecting pi-induced mtdna modifications by real-time pcr we spiked purified human leukocyte dna into human plasma 35 plasma65 intersol or pbs each sample 36 ml was treated with 150 lm amotosalen and 3 jcm 2 uva n  2 control samples were either untreated or treated in the absence of amotosalen or uva dna was extracted from each sample 02 ml in duplicate and assessed by measuring the inhibition of real-time pcr amplification in duplicate wells using mtdna-specific primers and sybr greenbased detection amplification of sequences ranging in size from 73 to 1065 bp was evaluated over 45 cycles of amplification subsequent to the initial feasibility tests a pilot validation was performed by treatment of platelets in 35 plasma65 inter-sol 30 ml six different platelet units were tested as outlined above for inhibition of amplification of endogenous mtdna sequences results treatment of purified dna with amotosalen plus uva resulted in 13 log to 60 log inhibition of pcr amplification results shown in table  the extent of pcr reduction roughly correlated with the size of the amplicon as well as with the type of diluent in the following order pbs  35 plasma  100 plasma exposure of platelets to amotosalen and uva showed an average of 25 log to 36 log reduction in pcr signal with increasing inhibition observed for larger amplicons in all cases no pcr inhibition was observed in the absence of amotosalen andor uva conclusions a quantitative real-time pcr assay specific for mtdna is capable of documenting pi-induced collateral nucleic acid modification in platelets based on this work this assay can be developed further for use as a quality control method for pi efficacy background and aims pathogen reduction technology prt provides a proactive approach to improving transfusion safety for platelet concentrates pcs however prt treatment is known to exacerbate the effects of the platelet storage lesion leading to increased platelet activation and secretion of immunomodulatory factors little is known regarding how prt-treated platelets may affect the cells of the recipients immune system once transfused therefore the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine responses of a recipients inflammatory cells after exposure to prt-treated platelets using an in vitro whole blood model of transfusion methods two aborhd matched buffy coat derived pcs were pooled and split to form matched pairs on day-1 post-collection n  11 one unit was treated with the mirasol prt tm system terumo bct while the other unit remained as an untreated control all units were stored at 22c with agitation and samples were taken on day 2 and 7 post-collection for in vitro transfusion experiments to represent a transfusion in vitro 10 vv platelets were incubated with aborhd-matched fresh whole blood with or without lipopolysaccharide lps 1 mgml for 6 h at 37c5 co 2  protein secretion was inhibited using brefeldin 2 lgml to allow detection of intra-cellular cytokine production in monocytes cd45  cd14   and neutrophils cd45   cd16   using multi-colour flow cytometry the fold change of cytokine production was calculated by comparison to a no-transfusion control whole blood without addition of platelets data was analysed using a one way anova with post-hoc tests for pair-wise comparisons results in the absence of lps both prt-treated and untreated platelets stored for 7 days significantly increased monocyte mip-1b expression 15-fold p  0047 whereas exposure to day 2 platelets did not result in any significant differences in mip-1b expression as expected lps stimulation significantly increased monocyte production of both il-12 50-to 74-fold and mip-1b 18-to 24-fold however lps-induced monocyte il-12 production was significantly reduced by exposure to prt-treated or untreated platelets stored for 2 days prt-treated 30-fold untreated 25-fold p  00001 and 7 days prt-treated 4-fold untreated 21-fold p  00001 furthermore il-12 production was significantly lower following exposure to day 7 prt-treated platelets compared to untreated platelets p  0006 however there was no significant difference following exposure to day 2 platelets lps-induced mip-1b production was not significantly differentfollowing exposure to either day 2 or day 7prt-treated or untreated platelets exposure to platelets untreated or prt-treated did not significantly modulate monocyte production of ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a il-1a il-1b il-6 il-8 il-10 or tnf-a co-culture of platelets and whole blood did not result in any significant changes to cytokine expression in neutrophils conclusion using an in vitro whole blood transfusion model we have demonstrated that exposure to prt-treated platelets stored for 7 days results in significant changes in the il-12 production by monocytes these changes may reflect the way prt-treated platelets interact with immune cells upon transfusion therefore the effect of stored prt-treated platelets especially in recipients with underlying inflammation should be further examined backgrounds hepatitis c virus hcv infection is one of the major causes of chronic hepatitic disease hcv has six genotypes and more than 80 subtypes the epidemiology of hcv subtypes vary with different geographic distribution understand the subtypes prevalent in certain area will help to understand the transmission modes and the spreading trend of hcv and thus help to make effective precautionary measures hcv subtypes are also closely related with clinical therapeutic effect it is important for guiding clinical therapy and prognosis and predicting the possible burden of hcv infection and treatment in the future aims to investigate and compare the prevalence of hcv subtypes in clinical patients and blood donors in guangdong china methods of 191 samples ofclinical patients and 222 samples of blood donors whose hcv rna were positive were collected from guangdong province hcv ns5b gene was amplified by rt-nested pcr and then sequenced hcv subtypes were assigned by constructing phylogenetic trees with mega5 software moreover spss160 software was applied to compare the difference between these two groups results of 191 clinical patients hcv genotype 1a 1b 2a 3a3b 6a and 6n was 2 105 127 6649 17 890 5 262 5 262 34 1780 and 1 052 respectively of 222 blood donors hcv genotype 1a 1b 2a 3a3b 6a and 6n was 1 045 92 4144 1 676 19 856 11 495 83 3739 and 1 045 respectively the proportion of hcv 1b was higher in clinical patients than in blood donorsv 2  25866 p  366e-07 while the proportion of 3a and 6a subtypes were higher in blood donors than in clinical patientsv 2  6602 p  0010 v 2  19398 p  106e-05 one possible cause was the transmission modes varied with different hcv subtypes hcv 1b is more related with blood transfusion while 3a and 6a are more relevant to intravenous drug abuse and sexual behavior with the anti-hcv screen implemented from 1993 the risk of hcv infection by transfusion is diminishing the other reason was the average time from hcv infection to serious pathological lesions is about 20 years and hcv 6a was transmitted into guangdong later than 1b conclusions in guangdong province hcv 1b and 6a were the predominant subtypes in clinical patients and blood donors the proportion of hcv 1b 3a and 6a subtypes were significantly different between clinical patients and blood donors the reason may relate with the time of hcv transmission into guangdong area and the hcv propagation modes blood safety and increased public health initiatives to reduce hcv infection from those in these high risk groups to the general population remain a priority background in japan we routinely evaluate the presence of transmission of hbv hcv and hiv in all transfused patients at three months after the last transfusion although the sensitivity of detection of hepatitis b virus hbv in blood donation improved during recent years transfusion transmitted hbv infection is left as a serious problem the japanese society of transfusion medicine and cellular therapy jstmct conducts the nationwide questionnaire survey about the clinical blood transfusion activities supported by ministry of health labour and welfare every year in this survey we can collect detailed characteristics of patients who showed a positive result of post-transfusion hbv-marker-test aims the aim of this study is to elucidate the cause of hbv positive in transfused patients materials and methods data concerning to transfused patients with positive hbvmarker were collected using results of the nationwide questionnaire survey in 2007-2011 in this questionnaire if there is a patient showing a positive result of hbsag andor hbvdna evaluated by post-transfusion-test it is requested that detailed patients characteristics including a total amount of transfusion disease hematologic or non-hematologic therapeutic methods surgery use of anticancer drugs use of immunosuppressive drugs use of molecular target drugs blood stem cell transplantation and results of hbv-marker-test prior to the first transfusion should report to the jstmct office a number of hbsag andor hbvdna positive patients were 234 cases in 2007-2011 among them 19 patients were not eligible because of the absence of results of hbv-related markers finally a total number of 215 patients 36 37 41 43 45 patients in 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 respectively were enrolled for the present study results all the eligible patients showed positive results of hbsag andor hbvdna in samples obtained from three months after the last transfusion we classified the cause of these results into five categories according to results of hbv-markers tests prior to the first transfusion i if a result of hbsag andor hbvdna performed prior to transfusion is positive a patient is categorized as the hbv carrier group ii a patient showing both a negative result of hbsag and positive results of anti-hbs andor anti-hbc are categorized as the hbv past-infection group iii if a patient shows no hbv-related marker prior to the first transfusion and patients hbvdna is identical to donors hbvdna we categorized as the transfusion transmitted infections tti group iv if a patient does not show any hbv-related marker prior to the first transfusion and hbvdna is not detected in donors blood by single nat we categorized as the unknown cause group results were summarized in table 1  conclusion although the positive result of hbsag andor hbvdna of transfused patients has been considered the sequel of blood transfusion we showed that hbv reactivation was also an important cause of it to distinguish hbv reactivation from transfusion transmitted infection we have to perform hbv-marker-test prior to the first transfusion or we should freeze pre-transfusion patients serum plenary session its all about red cells 2b-pl1 the english dictionary provides several definitions for the word myth one definition is a widely held but false belief this seems suitable for the purposes of this presentation but who decides what is false as we shall see in the course of this presentation some myths of blood groups may not be myths at all and some established facts may indeed be myths perhaps a more scientific definition would be a widely held but unproven belief abo the original and most important blood group in transfusion and transplantation medicine has engendered many myths these have mostly arisen through associations between abo groups and other characteristics such as personality dis-ease psychological traits and ideal diet although many may indeed be myths or even fabrications advanced for political reasons or financial gain some are not for example the statistical associations between abo type and thrombosis where a biochemical basis involving clearance of von willebrand factor from the blood by enzymatic cleavage appears to be affected by abh glycosylation in rh the first myth was that the human antibody now called anti-d was the same as the antibodies made by immunising rabbits with rhesus monkey red cells hence the name rhesus now rh for the blood group system in the 1940s early serological work with rh antibodies led to two genetic theories involving either one or three rh genes both theories have now been rejected because molecular genetics revealed two rh genes but was the three-gene theory really wrong when the boundaries of genes were not understood at the time since the 1960s it has been commonly understood that there are two types of variant d antigens weak d and partial d policies for transfusing patients with these variants have often been based on this dichotomy but is this a myth the difficulty we have in defining the terms weak d and partial d suggests that it might be it is always tempting to dismiss anything that we dont agree with as a myth as wiener one of the discoverers of the rhesus antigen wrote several papers on blood group mythology doing just that scientists should beware of falling into this trap perhaps myth is a term best avoided in science five new blood groups -what next the past 2 years has seen the discovery of five new blood groups at the isbt meeting in 2012 fors jr and lan were ratified as blood group systems and since then the molecular basis of the vel blood group antigen has been elucidated and the complement regulator protein cd59 has been shown itself to be a blood group antigen these last two discoveries will no doubt lead to their elevation to blood group systems how has this happened it turns out to be a mixture of old and new techniques rapid advances in molecular biology and in our understanding of the human genome have opened new fields of discovery within human blood groups the development of comprehensive snp arrays exome sequencing and rapid sequencing techniques eg next-generation sequencing has provide us with tools for rapid discovery combining these with sophisticated algorithms for database mining has resulted in the identification of the molecular bases behind the hitherto unresolved clinically relevant blood group antigens jr a and vel however classic biochemistry and subsequent peptide and dnasequencing still play an important role and lie behind the simultaneous discoveries of jr a and vel but also of lan and fors a rare cd59-deficient patient produced an alloantibody to a high-prevalence antigen that was shown to be targeted at the cd59 protein which was confirmed by routine dna-sequencing the jr a and lan antigens were assigned to already well-investigated abc-transporter proteins abcg2 and abcb6 respectively whose presence on the red blood cell rbc had not been established previously and for which the function on rbcs is still not known fors antigen was shown to result from the reactivation of the human pseudogene gbgt1 this enzyme builds the carbohydrate forssman antigen on sheep and dog rbcs but is normally inactive in humans a mutation that reactivated the enzyme explained the unusual a pae phenotype in two families vel was shown to be carried on a hitherto unknown protein on the rbc smim1 the function of the protein remains unknown although the protein is highly conserved across all species which is both intriguing and hints at a fundamental function absence of cd59 whose function in complement regulation is well-understood resulted in production of an alloanti-cd59 demonstrating immunogenicity of this protein for the first time these simultaneous discoveries have shown that regardless of the route of identification assignation of orphan antigens to their blood group home continues at a rate unparalleled since the 1990s as the -omics fields identify new erythroid genes and proteins and next generation sequencing permits rapid genome sequencing of individuals we can anticipate that many more currently unassigned antigens will find their genetic and molecular home 2c-s04-01 teo d blood services group health sciences authority singapore singapore an emerging infectious disease eid is defined as one that has appeared in a population for the first time or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range in 1992 an institute of medicine report predicted continued emergence and re-emergence of microbial pathogens facilitated by changes in human populations environment and infectious agents east and southeast asia with 30 of global population has a reputation as a hot spot for eid within the region the forces of rapid social economic and environmental change have resulted in factors such as urbanization deforestation agricultural intensification rapid population growth and mobility which contribute to the increased exposure and efficient transmission of new pathogens the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars exactly 10 years ago has dramatically transformed individual and national awareness and capabilities for identifying and responding to regional eid threats the re-emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza ah5n1 virus in 2004 isolation of novel bat-associated reoviruses in 2006 emergence of artemisinin-resistant malaria and discovery of a tick-borne bunyavirus associated with fever and thrombocytopenia in 2009 are some examples of eid emerging within the region since sars at the time of writing the situation involving human cases infected with avian influenza ah7n9 virus is evolving and there has been a recent report of human infection with avian influenza ah6n1 virus as well additionally there are imported eids such as influenza ah1n1 virus west nile virus and the present cause for concern in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus climate changes in recent years have also accelerated the increase in incidence and range of existing diseases such as dengue and chikungunya 40 of the worlds population is now at risk of dengue with the majority living in the asia-pacific region the scourge of dengue is sufficiently high in the region for the association of southeast asian nations asean in 2011 to designate 15 june as asean dengue day hepatitis e is another infection that is widespread in some parts of the region and reports of silent infection in blood donors are cause for further study the impact of eids on the blood supply may be direct through the potential for transmission through transfusion the effect on blood donor attendance and eligibility and the effect on blood demand blood products such as hyper-immune plasma preparations may be useful treatment options in some eids there is a need for constant surveillance and the capacity to identify assess and manage eid risks to the blood supply in recent years the strengthening of regional and international partnerships and the availability of new diagnostic tools has improved our ability to respond to infectious threats nonetheless the volatile and ever-changing nature of eids will remain a constant challenge to the vigilance and response capabilities of the transfusion medicine community summary the residual transmission risk is relatively high in hbv followed by hcv and hiv-1 this finding is not new as malaysia is a country of medium seroprevalence for hbv which ranges from 15 to 98 in the general population but is relatively low in blood donor population 004 the obi nat yield was higher than acute phase wp in hbv-nat yield these obi positivity have shown inconsistent nat results on repeat testing and also low viral loads ranging from 12 to 317 iuml in contrast for hiv and hcv nat yields their viral loads were consistently high 34220-424310 cpml and 42780-5980 350 iuml respectively implementation of id-nat is probably the best option to improve blood safety especially for the detection of low viral load such as in obi and sero-negative wp donation in malaysia scenario blood centers reported to kcdc repository samples of these donors were tested for anti-hav igmigg and hav-rna if any of these test result was positive the recipients of the blood components generated from these donations were traced transfusion records of hospital were reviewed to identify recipients of blood suspected to be contaminated with hav recipients were contacted by telephone if the recipients agreed participating in the investigation laboratory test was performed results from may 2007 to december 2011 15 donors notified the blood center of having been diagnosed with hepatitis a the median interval from donation to diagnosis in donors was 182 days table  eleven 73 of these 15 were male donors and the median age was 28 years range 19-42 years the pcr for hav rna was positive in all of 15 depository samples of these donors none of the repository samples showed positive result of anti-hav igm a total of 44 blood components rbc 15 units pc 14 units and ffp 15 units were delivered to hospitals twenty six products were transfused to 26 patients and the rest 18 blood components 4 rbcs 1 pc and 13 ffps were recalled immediately and discarded twelve recipients 46 were already expired fourteen recipients agreed to participate in the lookback procedure through testing twelve recipients did not showed viremic for hav however two recipients showed positive either on the test for anti-hav igm or hav-rna these two recipients who were 35 and 37 years old developed symptoms on 46 and 48 days after blood transfusion respectively they were treated for hepatitis a successfully summaryconclusions recipients who had anti-hav igg were not infected with hav even though they were transfused with blood suspected to be contaminated with hav however ttha cases were those who did not have anti-hav igg and all of them were 30s in korea most people under 40 years old are susceptible to hav because of low immunity there is a risk of transfusion transmitted infection if recipients received blood contaminated with hav 2c-s04-04 cable rt 1  pistorius c 1  andersson m 2  maponga t 2  lopez t 2  preiser w 2 and tedder r 3 1 hav seroprevalence was highest in the black donors 86 lower in coloured donors 62 and lowest white donors 36 all were hav igm negative there was an age-related increase from 448 52116 in those 16-25 years old to 81 4758 in those 46 years although no active hev infection was identified by pcr on pooled samples 25 of donors were hev igg positive rates were highest in whites at 33 followed by coloured at 23 and lowest in black at 19 again prevalence increased with age from 121 in those 16-25 years to 483 in those 46 years discussion the results show a lower hav seroprevalence in the white population compared to the black and coloured population groups likely to be due to socioeconomic living conditions such a contrast is striking given the introduction of democracy in south africa almost 20 years ago the reduction in anti-hbc as a marker of past hbv infection with age is reassuring suggesting that hbv vaccination is impacting hbv population prevalence the pattern of hev exposure appears to implicate a zoonotic transmission route rather than being related to socio-economic circumstances given the subclinical nature of hev infection in healthy donors larger studies are urgently needed to establish the prevalence of active infection in blood donors background hbv demonstrates remarkable genetic variability with eight genotypes and more subgenotypes in addition mutations in the polymerase region may lead to drug resistance and changes in the pres region including deletions and mutations such as t31c and t53c and precbcp region mutations including a1762tg1764a g1896a t1896a c1766t t1768a are associated with higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma hcc aims to study the hbv subgenotype distribution and analyze the changes in pres region precbcp and the polymerase region of hbv in chinese blood donors methods of 245 blood samples were selected randomly from hbsag positive blood donors from five blood centers in china the pres plus s region or the whole genome of hbv was amplified and sequenced and hbv subgenotype was determined the amino acid sequences of the polymerase region were aligned and the mutations related to drug resistance were determined the nucleotide sequences of pres region and precbcp region were aligned and the mutations related to hcc were determined distribution of genotype subgenotype and mutations by different regions were examined using chi-square statistics results of 200 samples 816were subgenotyped successfully the predominant subgenotypes were b2 c2 d1 and a1 which accounted for 505 192 53 and 34 respectively deletions and mutations t31c and t53c in pres region were found in 28 28200 140 samples five of these 28 samples 25 of all samples have deletions and no deletions specific to genotype d was detected the prevalence of mutations in pres region was significantly higher in genotype c than in genotype b p  0001 mutations in polymerase region were found in 14 samples 7 14 200 most of which were related to resistance to adefovir and lamivudine mutations in precbcp region were found in 68 samples 298 68228 the prevalence of hbeag was significantly lower in samples with mutations in precbcp region than that in the samples with no mutation p  002 more a1762tg1764a mutations were found in c than b genotype while the opposite was observed for g1896a mutation ps  001 conclusions subgenotype b2 was the most frequent strain circulating in hbv infected chinese blood donors followed by c2 hcc related mutations were found less in pres region but more in precbcp region in blood donors the prevalence of mutations in pres region and a1762tg1764a mutations was higher in genotype c than in genotype b while the opposite is the case for g1896a mutations this is consistent with the distribution of hcc related mutations in general hbv carriers in china since all donors in this study reported not having received hbv treatment it is not clear whether drug resistance mutations occurred spontaneously in the hbv-infected blood donors or were acquired by the donors from hbv infected patients who underwent antiviral therapy 2c-s05-01 a fresh look at measuring quality in blood components devine d confidence in the quality of blood components produced for transfusion particularly with respect to their safety and efficacy is a necessity for clinicians and patients alike the assurance of blood product quality is dependent upon the collection of data that can demonstrate products are within specification however the linkage between confidence that an individual blood component unit will perform as expected and the conduct of quality testing is imperfect this begins with the manner in which we conduct these tests although we describe our practice as quality control it is in fact a type of process control testing in which we test a small proportion of our production inventory to ensure that the process was conducted properly this testing is often conducted at product outdate long after problem products have been issued and used in hospitals in addition the standards used to assess blood components often have wiggle room for example the north american standards for the number of platelets in a whole blood-derived platelet concentrate require that at least 75 of tested products meet or exceed the required platelet count in practice this means that up to 25 of individual platelet components issued to hospitals may have fewer platelets than the user specification requires there are other examples in component quality standards of this same phenomenon in an utopian blood production laboratory there would be real time quality control measures that would be made prior to release of a unit to the hospital blood bank or transfusion service and these measures would be highly predictive of product efficacy as a community we have considerable work to do to get to this utopian ideal first we must identify better product characteristics to use as standards for blood component production modern science especially in the field of cell biology has made huge strides since quality standards were first introduced some 50 years ago yet we have not applied these advances to quality assessment for blood products those studying blood component quality have begun to collect data sets that will help to inform this change over to new standards production methods are only one way to impact component quality another is the actual features of the donors themselves this biological variation includes not only well known phenomena such as the range of platelet counts in normal healthy humans or the distribution of plasma factor viii or fibrinogen levels but also appears to extend to storage characteristics of components made from individual donations this presentation will review the state of the science of product quality and the regulation of blood products including new information arising from clinical trials and the application of modern scientific methods such as proteomics and metabolomics to the broad question of blood component quality background blood transfusion has been shown to be associated with poorer surgical outcomes such as higher incidence of infection higher mortality and increased number of serious adverse events microparticles mp released in packed red cells pc in storage have been suggested to be mediators for transfusion-related complications however the underlying mechanism for mp release during storage is mostly unresolved aims to examine mp released in pc in storage for procoagulant and proinflammatory activity and define the role of residual platelets in pc in generation of mp during storage methods i leukoreduced lr and non-lr nlr packed cells pc were stored according to blood bank standards and sampled at day 0 10 20 30 and 40 assay of mp was by flow cytometry using mab to label cd235a cd45 cd41 and cd62e thrombin generation tg and cd11b expression were used as measures of procoagulance and proinflammation respectively ii the impact of platelets was further evaluated by reconstituting lr pc with increasing concentrations of platelets at day 0 results i multiple species of mp were released in a time-dependent manner using nlr pc we found that relative to day 0 red cell mp rmp were increased by 259 at day 20 and by 859 by day 40 small amounts of mp from leukocytes lmp platelets pmp and endothelia emp were detected generally 20 as many as rmp levels of pmp rose rapidly from day 0 and peaked at day 20 lmp began rising at 20 days increasing to 159 at day 30 and 249 at day 40 emp changed little over 40 days ii comparing mp in nlr vs lr pc as expected pmp and lmp were higher in nlr pc unexpectedly however the rate of rmp production was 50 as fast in lr vs nlr pc the levels of rmp were found to be significantly associated with residual platelet counts therefore we investigated the possible role of platelets in rmp production iii effects of residual platelets on rmp release when lr pc were incubated with increasing numbers of platelets 0-200000 per ll rmp as well as pmp generation increased rate of increase of rmp was closely associated with platelet count and storage time this shows that residual platelets catalyze rmp generation iv procoagulant and proinflammatory activities mp-mediated thrombin generation and cd11b expression increased from day 0 to day 40 in both lr and nlr pc but in lr pc it was only 30-50 magnitude of nlr pc the time course curves did not match any specific mp species conclusions procoagulant and pro-inflammatory mp were generated in a timedependent manner the new finding is that residual platelets markedly augment release of rmp which is a known indicator for storage lesion the benefits of leukoreduction may be due to reduction of platelets and mp production in addition to reduction of wbc reducing platelet count in pc may be beneficial in reducing storage lesion and transfusion related complications background it has been reported the soluble cd40 ligand scd40l scd154 that was accumulated during platelet storage induce polymorphonuclear leukocyte pmn mediated damage of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cellshmvecs was a potential cofactor in developing the transfusion-related acute lung injury trali however the amount of scd40l was only slightly elevated in the recipient by transfused blood components as it was fully diluted in the recipients blood circulation the mechanism by which cd40l exert its effect is still needs to be elucidated aim to determine the effect of platelet derived microparticles pmp on pmn mediated hmvecs damage and its correlation with pmp bounded cd40l method the pmps were isolated by centrifugation of the platelet-free plasma from 10 apheresis platelet concentrates a-plts at 20000 g for 1 h the pmps were counted by flow cytometric analysis followed by western blotting that was performed on isolated pmps the scd40l was assayed with elisa the priming of the formyl-met-leu-phe fmlp activated pmn respiratory burst was measured with the hydrogen-peroxide production a two-insult in vitro model of pmn-mediated hmvecs damage was used to investigate the effect of pmp result the pmp priming activity to pmn are correlative with pmp accumulations and their level of scd40l during 5 days storage correlation was significant at the 005 level pmn respiratory burst are declined by removing pmp with 01 lm pvdf membrane filtration or depletion pmp with cd154 monoclonal antibody combining magnetic dynabeads pan mouse igg the lipopolysaccharideslps activated hmvecs were damaged more significantly by pmp isolated from 5-day stored a-plts compared with 1-day stored a-plts p  005 conclusion platelet-derived microparticles carry concentrated cd40l signal promote pmn mediated hmvecs damage may be relative to developing of trali background continuous efforts has spared on improving the quality of platelets harvested from plateletpheresis little is known about the contribution of donors on the variation of platelet quality particular the effect of frequent platelet donation on donors platelet function aims aim of this study is to investigate the effect of frequent platelet donation on the state of in vivo platelet activation in platelet donors material and methods of 107 whole blood donors and 335 platelet donors with vary donation history from 1 to 74 times mean at 115 ae 127 were recruited they were stratified into three subgroups according to their previous plateletpheresis history g1 0-1 time g2 2-10 times and g3 10 times blood sample were collected from each participant for the determination of plasma levels of soluble p-selectin sp-selectin marker of platelet activation and total platelet p-selectin tp-selectin as well as platelet count and platelet indices results following the increase of donation times sp-selectin levels were steady

including variables of abo blood groups as well as donation history sex age indicated that increased plateletpheresis donations are positively associated with the elevated sp-selectin levels in blood donors t  416 p  00001 conclusion our data suggested that frequent plateletpheresis result in the increased level of sp-selectin in platelet donors implicating a higher state of platelet activation in vivo in frequent platelet donors the potential effects of frequent plateletpheresis on the quality of platelet harvested and the donor complication are worthy of attention backgroundaims structural and functional changes in erythrocytes occur during ex vivo storage including the accumulation of bioactive substances in the supernatant of red cell concentrates rccs many of the constituents of the supernatant fraction which are potential mediators of transfusion-related complications may be reduced by washing of rccs with emerging paediatric clinical data supporting a beneficial effect of rcc washing prior to transfusion the aim of the current study was to characterise the effects of rcc age and post-washing storage on erythrocyte structure function and the accumulation of bioactive substances in paediatric-sized washed rccs methods two units of aborhd-and age-matched rccs either 1-or 4-days old n  11 each were pooled and equally split to obtain matched pairs day 0 one unit was washed with 09 saline by repeated centrifugation then resuspended in 100 ml sag-m while the other remained unwashed subsequently both rcc units were divided equally to produce 4 units of paediatric-sized washed or unwashed rccs all units were stored at 2-8c and samples were taken on days 0 1 2 7 and 14 of storage to measure metabolic activity and quality of rccs as well as the concentration and activity of bioactive substances in the rcc supernatant the overall effects of washing and storage were compared using repeated measures anova with posthoc paired t-tests as required with p  005 considered significant results the washing process resulted in reductions in red cell count 93 haemoglobin 92 and haematocrit 59 compared to unwashed rccs overall washing and subsequent storage of 1-and 4-day old rccs significantly reduced the ph p  00001 lactate production rate p  00001 and 23-diphosphoglycerate concentration p  0046 although the atp content of the rcc decreased during storage it was not changed by washing p  0570 haemolysis in the rccs was increased by the washing process but remained 015 on day 14 for all products extracellular potassium was significantly reduced by washing p  00001 but increased during storage in both washed and unwashed red cells p  00001 for both washing significantly reduced the number of microparticles in the supernatant of both 1-and 4-day-old rcc compared to unwashed rccs p  001 and 0012 respectively however the microparticle number in the supernatant of all rccs increased during storage washing of both 1-and 4-day old rcc also markedly reduced the supernatant concentration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 scd62p rantes anaphylatoxins c3a c4a and c5a and iga to levels below or near the limit of detection incubation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs with supernatant from unwashed rcc led to endothelial cell activation with increased cell-surface expression of e-selectin and vcam p  00001 for both however little or no activation was observed when huvecs were incubated with supernatant from washed rcc conclusion although washing affected some aspects of the in vitro quality of rccs it effectively reduced the concentration and activity of bioactive substances in the supernatant of rccs leading to reduced endothelial cell activation such a reduction may be clinically beneficial in selected patient groups blood services group health sciences authority singapore singapore many of the critical issues associated withbiobanking have been effectively addressed in blood banking blood transfusion therapy with its emphasison traceability has developed robust systems for inventory and product release the ethos of proper quality management hasalso been an integral part of blood banking the lessons learnt have been applied into the biobanking of cord blood stem cells tissue and organs biobanking includes both banking of tissuefor research only as well as public cord blood banks that play a vital rolesupporting clinical stem cell transplantation the growth of regenerative medicine will only increase the scope variety and numbers in biobanking similarly the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells ips and itspotential myriad applications has highlighted the central role of biobanking inboth diagnostics research and therapeutics principles and key considerations in biobanking including biospecimenprocurement consent processing preservation and traceability will beaddressed introduction cell therapy generally includes the extraction processing manipulation and implantation of characterized cells effectuating specific functions in a patient however adjacent fields like tissue banking or tissue engineering should be incorporated all together have donor selection and validated core procedures in common production cycles are carried out in gmp clean rooms furthermore quality control includes assays which are common in transfusion medicine it might be tempting to speculate that cell therapy is closely related with transfusion medicine and requires minor adaptions the big moat surrounding cell therapy but there are huge differences cell therapy is a domain of specialists rooted in patient care with profound knowledge about specific pathologies and how to target them cell therapy derives from individual clinical needs and rarely is a prefabricated procedure this is in stark contrast to transfusion medicine which focuses on standardized products for any patient in need today complex regulations for cell therapy surpass those in transfusion medicine this distracts clinicians in a cell therapy program this may aspire transfusion medicine specialists to engage in cell therapies however only a small niche is left for blood centers as two major trends arise one is the more or less academic gmp setting utilizing the hospital exemption status the other is the commercial arena where companies produce standardized cell therapies to achieve maximized market shares academic gmp entities promote individualizedmainly autologoustherapies which require a constant flow of financial assets to keep underused clean rooms running therefore it is serious to ask why and where blood centers should engage in cell therapies strategy first transfusion medicine has been heavily influenced by external factors such as viral safety blood usage cost pressures and low resources the term transfusion medicine misleads outsiders to suppose that it deals with transfusions nothing else a wise strategy must include a change in the mind-set of all this is the most crucial issue as many clinicians are needed to collaborate and co-develop cell therapies without deeply rooted partnerships it is impossible to establish sustainable cell therapy programs in a blood center furthermore a thorough evaluation includes possible products quantities as well reimbursement schemes cell therapy is one of the most expensive treatments and financial assets must be secured first second establishing a cell therapy facility a mock-up facility without clean room status is highly recommended processes will be developed staff is enabled to learn and define procedures before a cell therapy unit is planned planning and establishing a cell therapy unit is very complex and specific expertise is scarce a basic prerequisite is a project manager carrying out final decisions with a profound knowledge about processes interacting with different technologies hvac controls microbiology cell therapy units fail if project management has flaws and deep involvement of engineering with medical expertise is ignored a cell therapy unit is an endless stressful path riddled with expensive failures but rewards in the long run a blood center with exciting future prospects integrating grateful clinicians and patients any kind of accreditation either by regulatory authorities or any professional entity like jaciefact is an important milestone in the time line of a new cell therapy and a possible showstopper of a long expensive and enduring project honest and thorough preparations before accreditation should start before an application may be sent three phases are distinguishable keeping the basics on track running a cell therapy unit is a high wire task fundamental knowledge about the medical background processes quality control specifications is interwoven with engineering and controlling tasks it is inevitable for anyone working in this environment to know about air quality hygiene staff education and additional technical features especially controls and the design of engineering and its qualification should be documented continuously maintenance re-qualifications adjustments in the control-system of a clean room facility offer chances to learn the interplay of systems build a sufficient knowledge base and freeze the process protocols for cell therapy are often introduced on primary events and work well in first shot experiments as further patients are included it is very probable that the whole process and specifications will be modified and sometimes fundamentals and documentation are out of focus altering and scaling methods processes and assays may or may not change the product or its intended use slippage is often not detected and therefore first steps aim at the build-up of as much information as possible firstly current literature has to be collected reanalyzed and mirrored onto the own processes then the regulatory framework has to be analyzed the main question is how the product fits into the regulatory system is it an atmp or non-manipulated cell product is it a blood product or a pharmaceutical pros and cons about alterations should be meticulously discussed and alternative procedures highlighted in this phaseespecially those which are already accredited it will be very probable that the same inspectors who have inspected similar cell therapy units know about alternative procedures and will raise comparative questions after building up the knowledge base it is advisable to finish a risk assessment focused on the intended use in patients and to revamp the process after adjusting all methods processes and assays the whole production has to be frozen further changes are prohibited and the documentation has to be refreshed the last test trial in the last phase before accreditation all aspects of quality management have to be finished risk assessments should focus on the safety and effectivity of the cell therapy donorpatient eligibility criteria quality control of incoming cells and tissues production processes and their internal quality control criteria as well storage conditions have to be well documented and validated under certain circumstances a file of clinical studies has to be prepared all documents and clinical studies should be reviewed regulatory aspects should be clear a preparation project gives better chances to pass the last milestone before patients can be treated on a regular cell therapy 2d-s07-01 burnouf t plasma fractionation is a complex biotechnological process exhibiting unique features compared to downstream technologies used for recombinant proteins vaccines and animal-derived antisera in human plasma fractionation by contrast to other biological products multiple end-products typically 5-10 or more are obtained from the same manufacturing pool some of the targeted proteins are present in plasma in large amounts as is the case for albumin and immunoglobulin whereas by contrast others such as coagulation factors and anticoagulant proteins are in trace amounts with the emergence of selective hemotherapy plasma fractionation has over the years turned into a highly integrated protein separation process carefully designed to isolate various proteins under optimized conditions of yield and purity current plasma fractionation methodologies combine diverse protein purification tools based on crude precipitation techniques and refined chromatographic procedures some proteins are stable and not prone to degradation while others with specialized functional activity are fragile and prone to enzymatic degradation activation or aggregation contamination of plasma products with harmful residual plasma protein impurities such as activated coagulation factors or proteases can lead to serious adverse events in some patients in addition while a few plasma products like albumin and immunoglobulin can be formulated as liquid preparations all others products are freeze-dried to ensure long-term stability which increases cost and technical difficulties the diversity of protein products made from plasma explains why plasma fractionation facilities have complex design the manufacturing lines of the various fractions should be strictly segregated from one another in addition the risk of viral contamination of plasma pools requires that each product be subjected to several typically two or more dedicated viral reduction treatments the goal being to gradually increase the degree of viral safety along the downstream process production zones should therefore be physically segregated to limit risks of cross-or downstream contaminations adding to the complexity of the plant design flows of product personnel and wastes and working procedures the plasma fractionation industry has a long history from the years 1940s when cohn and co-workers developed a sequential cold ethanol precipitation process this method which evolved over the years remains the core fractionation process albeit integrated with cryoprecipitation and multiple chromatographic steps combined with modern viral removal treatments the current fractionation process ensures therapeutic protein products of established quality and safety at more or less acceptable yields the current safety record of plasma products which contrasts with that of earlier product generations somehow represent an impediment to the emergence of new fractionation technologies novel plasma fractionation processes based on integrated chromatographic steps membrane electrophoresis aqueous two-phase system mini-pool fractionation in disposable equipment are being developed at pilot-scale and represent interesting alternatives to reach the market such technologies should be integrated with robust viral reduction steps and proven to achieve at least equal if not superior products yield quality safety and productivity to justify the regulatory load clinical trials and licensing of what would be regarded by most regulatory agencies as new plasma products requiring full validation effective specific antiviral agent is generally not available for emerging infectious disease agents such as sars-coronavirus and middle-east-respiratory-syndromecoronavirus passive immunotherapy with plasma or plasma derived hyperimmune globulins have been used for treatment or prophylaxis against many exotoxin mediated

antigenically drifted viruses are associated with seasonal outbreaks poultry to human transmission of avian influenza a h7n9 and h5n1 virus can cause acute community acquired pneumonia with 25 to 50 mortality risk factors including extremes of age pregnancy underlying medical illness and low serum igg2 are associated with severe pneumonia with delayed clearance of viral load and excessive proinflammatory response though treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors within 48 hours after onset of symptoms should be effective those with severe disease and respiratory failure usually present later than 5 days after symptom onset during the 2009 pandemic of h1n1 influenza we harvested convalescent plasma from a small percentage of recovered adults sufficient for a case control study for treating severe cases during the pandemic in hong kong plasma supply is constrained by plasmapheresis capacity during most stages of the epidemic between august 26 to october 31 2009 a total of 9101 persons were successfully contacted a total of 1309 screening and 619 whole blood donation appointments were made in the former 786 600 attended screening but only 301 could donate plasma by apheresis because of failure to meet blood donation eligibility criteria failed laboratory tests insufficient neutralization antibody titers and inability to make the apheresis appointment for those who opted for whole blood donation 379 612 had attended and donated 105 l 21 units and 276 l of convalescent plasma with sufficient neutralization antibodies titers was collected for passive immunotherapy as convalescent plasma or h-ivig production respectively we recruited 93 patients with severe h1n1 2009 infection already put on neuraminidase inhibitors and requiring intensive care twenty patients 215 received convalescent plasma mortality in the treatment group was significantly lower than the demographically matched control nontreatment group 200 vs 548 p  001 convalescent plasma treatment was associated with significantly lower day 3 5 and 7 viral load compared with the control group p  005 and corresponding lower serum levels of il6 il10 and tnf p  005 between 2010 and 2011 35 patients were randomized to receive h-ivig 17 patients or ivig 18 patients no adverse event related to treatment was reported serial respiratory viral load demonstrated that h-ivig treatment was associated with significantly lower day 5 and 7 posttreatment viral load when compared to the control p  004 and p  002 respectively the initial serum cytokine level was significantly higher in the h-ivig group but fell to similar level 3 days after treatment subgroup multivariate analysis of the 22 patients who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset demonstrated that h-ivig treatment was the only factor which independently reduced mortality or014 95 ci 002-092 p  004 background in recent years with the global spread of the west nile virus wnv dengue virus denv and chikungunya virus chikv that are transmissible by mosquitoes concern has arisen regarding their entry to japan furthermore chikv as well as wnv and denv are potentially transfusion-transmissible posing a serious risk for transfusion medicine of these wnv and denv belong to the flavivirus genus as does the japanese encephalitis virus jev and they have similar antigenicity since most japanese people are periodically vaccinated against jev there is a possibility that anti-jev antibodies cross-react with wnv and denv and induce a protective immune response however because wnv and denv have similar antigenicity to jev there is concern that the anti-jev antibodies are present in japanese plasma against wnv and denv owing to antibody-dependent enhancement ade in fccr-expressing cells furthermore if the anti-jev antibodies present in japanese plasma have high ade activity these antibodies may act in an infection-enhancing manner rather than an infection-neutralizing manner against wnv and denv in vivo aims using intravenous immunoglobulin ivig prepared from pooled plasma from japanese donors we evaluated its neutralizing activity and ade activity against these viruses for the purpose of estimating the potency of the japanese individuals to protect themselves against these viruses methods neutralizing activity tcid 50  and ade activity were compared among three types of ivig nisseki polyglobin n made in japan gammagard made in germany and sanglopor made in the usa tcid 50 was calculated from the results of cytopathic effect cpe assay using vero cells as target cells ade activity was measured by plaque assay using bhk cells and fccr-expressing bhk cells as target cells results nisseki polyglobin n showed a significantly higher neutralizing activity against jev than gammagard and sanglopor the neutralizing activity of nisseki polyglobin n against wnv was approximately a log reduction factor of 23 higher than that of sanglopor furthermore the neutralizing activity of nisseki polyglobin n showed approximately the same neutralizing activity as gammagard against wnv none of the ivig preparations showed significant neutralizing activity against denv or chikv nisseki polyglobin n showed only marginal ade activity against any of the viruses conclusion although the neutralizing activity of plasma from japanese individuals is not known it is suggested that the japanese population as a whole has a potency to protect themselves from infection by wnv to some extent probably due to the cross-reaction of anti-jev antibodies to wnv as a result of jev vaccination and natural infection therefore if wnv invades japan a pandemic may not occur and the risk of wnv infection by blood transfusion may be low it was suggested that plasma from the japanese individuals has almost no neutralizing activity against denv and chikv nisseki polyglobin n showed only marginal ade activity against wnv and denv suggesting the low possibility of the anti-jev antibodies present in japanese plasma acting as infection-enhancing agents against wnv and denv as a function of ade background platelet-rich-plasma prp platelet gel pg and platelet lysate pl are used in regenerative medicine to stimulate the healing of soft and hard tissues in addition to their tissue regenerative properties platelet materials are claimed mostly through anecdotal observations to limit post-surgical inflammation and decrease pain the anti-inflammatory properties are thought to be due to the release of platelet components including transforming growth factor-b1 tgf-b1 and hepatocyte growth factor hgf which are known to inhibit some inflammatory pathways in vitro however there is a large diversity in the type of platelet fractions used in clinics they differ significantly in protein composition and content of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules and may therefore not be equally effective in controlling inflammation one needs to elucidate the factors responsible for the possible anti-inflammatory properties of platelet materials to standardize the preparation and clinical use of these products when an anti-inflammation effect is clinically beneficial aims to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of various plasma platelet fractions using an established in vitro model of raw 2647 mice macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide lps and studying the production of nitric oxide no inducible nitric oxide synthase inos and cyclooxygenase-2 cox-2 methods apheresis platelet concentrates pc were obtained from three donors and separated within 3 days into pc platelet poor plasma ppp platelet gel releasate pg frozen-thawed platelet lysate pl and solvent-treated platelet lysate sd-pl proteins were determined sds-page patterns obtained and growth factors quantified by elisa raw 2647 cells were grown in medium supplemented with 10 of fetal bovine serum fbs or plasmaplatelet fractions with or without lps 500 ng ml added after 24 h of culture cell growth and cytotoxicity were checked by cell count determination and mtt assay no was determined in cell culture supernatants by colorimetric assay and inos and cox-2 in cell extracts by western blot prp from mice and quercetin a known anti-inflammatory compound were used as controls results pc and sd-pl had the highest mean tgf-b1 content ranging from approximately 100-200 ngml and ppp the lowest 5-10 ngml cell count analysis and mtt assays showed consistent cell growth and viability in all conditions evaluated but were slightly lower in the presence of lps and quercetin as expected there was no no inos cox-2 detected in absence of lps stimulation the plasma and platelet fractions were all found to reduce no production and inos expression when compared to fbs after lps stimulation interestingly inhibition of no production and inos was generally more pronounced with sd-pl cox-2 synthesis was lower in the presence of sd-pl compared to other plasmaplatelet fractions and higher with pg the mice prp did not exert any stronger anti-inflammatory action in this mice cellular model suggesting absence of species specificity conclusions the plasma and platelet fractions evaluated exert to various degrees an anti-inflammatory effect mostly revealed by inhibition of no production and inos impact on cox-2 synthesis is less obvious the fact that sd-pl exhibits stronger global anti-inflammatory activity requires further studies 2d-s08-01 tani y japanese red cross kinki block blood center ibaraki japan rare blood is generally defined as one that occurs at a frequency of 11001000 individuals or less and it is sometimes difficult to provide such blood types to patients because of their rarities the japanese red cross jrc society lists 46 rare blood phenotypes that are divided in two categories as shown in table 1  the rare blood types listed in category i occur much less frequently than those listed in category ii we screen for rare blood cells using monoclonal antibodies moabs since 1987 our blood center has established 93 moabs 32 human and 61murine and has provided them to the other blood centers many of igg moabs are available on the machine such as beckman coulter pk-7300 blood grouping analyzer by saline or bromelin method by cross-linking with anti-human or anti-mouse igg in addition we routinely screen for antigen negative-cells rhc c e e jk a  jk b  fy b  di a  m le a  s to which antibodies are believed to be clinically significant thus more than 10000 donors with rare blood phenotypes category i 748 category ii 9314 are registered in japan but the number of donors with some category i blood types are insufficient we freeze rare blood particularly category i types and domestically and sometimes internationally supply these units of blood since 1977 a total of 576 units of rare blood with phenotypes dib- d- jra- ko jka-b- para-bombay p ena- m k m k  lan-and rhnull have been supplied to 23 international countries thus the jrc contributes to the international panel of donors of rare blood type idp which is maintained by the international blood group reference laboratory ibgrl in bristol uk the idp provides information on the location of rare blood donors when they cannot be found in their respective countries the jrc has encountered difficulties in finding rare donors with rhnull p k  m k m k  ena- u-and ge-phenotypes we also joined the isbt working party on rare donors which handles all matters related to rare blood our rare blood donor program is successful because of international cooperation 2d-s08-02 the china national rare blood group screening program started in 2008 the program has screened more than 1500000 donors in thirteen regional blood centers by using large-scale serological tests gene diagnosis and other different specific screening technique now more than 1300 donors with rare blood phenotypes have been found including rh null d -- wrb- lua-b- jka-b- vel- lan- coa- k 0  dib- s-as well as yta- the primary target for the project is to screen the negative blood antigens whose conjugational antigens have high frequency and the blood groups which is easy to produce antibodies and the negative antigen in the system is very rare in chinese population for example fya- whose frequency was 1400 in chinese han population a professional website for rare blood groups httpwwwchinararebloodcnwas set up and serviced in jan 2010 the information of blood donors with rare blood types is registered into the national registering system for blood donors with rare blood types by professional technician from organizations join the program the information includes the specificity of the rare blood types other common blood groups personal data of donors and the information of contacts except the network administrator other visitors could only see the specificity of the rare blood type and the number of the rare blood in rare blood bank storage application for the rare blood products should communicate with contacts through administrator according to the standard of the pretransfusion test in china all the donors and recipients must be identified the abo and rh systems and done the cross-match test in addition all the donors must pass the test for contagious marks nowadays more and more chinese blood centers use nucleic acid technique to detect hiv and hcv the results of infection test must be added to the information of the blood products at every time for collecting the rare blood in recent 2 years 21 units 1 unit  200 ml blood products with different rare blood types have been used in clinical treatment background anti-emm is a rare specificity detecting the high-prevalence red blood cell rbc antigen emm isbt 901008 five cases were reported by daniels et al transfusion 1987 27319 and two by reid et al transfusion 1998 38 suppl 101s six of these were in untransfused males and anti-emm had not been implicated in a transfusion reaction most likely because the patients were not transfused case study a 58-year-old untransfused japanese man with group a d datnegative rbcs urgently needed transfusion due to an abdominal stab wound pretransfusion testing using gel column agglutination and peg-iat demonstrated an antibody reactive with all panel cells but non-reactive with autologous rbcs anti-le a was detected by papain methods using gel column unavoidably one bag of crossmatch-incompatible lea- rbcs had to be transfused thirty minutes after transfusion he experienced a drop in blood pressure and hematuria however as his hb level was 55 gdl another two rbc bags were transfused and his vital signs became stable on day 3 he was transfused one rbc bag without a hemolytic transfusion reaction on day 6 after receiving 30ml of rbcs the patient vomited and had cola-colored urine t-bil 61 mgdl ldh 912 ul and the transfusion was stopped following transfusion his rbcs reacted in the dat 1 on day 1 2 on day 3 and negative on day 7 thereafter his anemia improved gradually by iron medication and he was discharged on day 24 aims to identify the antibody in the patients plasma that caused the transfusion reaction methods serological testing was performed by standard methods result the patients plasma reacted in saline at 4c 2 by albumin iat 2 peg-iat 2 and papain-iat 3 with all panel cells and by peg-iat with 30 samples lacking high-prevalence antigens the autologous rbcs were non-reactive testing his plasma against phenotypically-similar enzyme or chemically treated rbcs showed that the antigen detected was resistant to bromelin papain ficin trypsin a-chymotrypsin pronase dtt aet and acid two examples of emm-rbcs were non-reactive and the antibody was identified as anti-emm the reactivity of enzyme and chemically treated rbcs is consistent with anti-emm his rbcs reacted with antibodies to 17 high-prevalence antigens but could not be confirmed as emmbecause anti-emm was not available the anti-emm was igg1 and igg3 with a titer of 16 by peg-iat before transfusion rising to 128 on day 10 his serum demonstrated hemolysis after day 6 no other underlying antibodies were detected in the patients plasma alloadsorbed to remove the anti-emm conclusions we report the first japanese case of anti-emm and the first to cause an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction ahtr in previous reports six people with anti-emm were untransfused men and one was in a woman whose transfusion history was unknown suggesting that the antibodies may be naturally-occurring the anti-emm reported here also in an untransfused man also may be considered a naturally-occurring antibody similar to the first reported example of anti-emm the antibody reacted albeit weakly at 4c our case suggests that anti-emm is clinically-significant as the patient experienced an ahtr 2d-s09-01 background to recruit blood donation volunteers and provide stable blood supply according to demand it is more important to change the overall social perception than to carry out one-time event or short-term campaign the social understanding of blood donation is formed as valuable and honorable service over certain level in korean society nevertheless there still are many people who dont even try to participate in blood donation because of fear health concern and expectation for reward to change this culture and social awareness it is important for the present and future blood donors to have a perception that the blood donation is the sharing ones life and a genuine service which helps other people for nothing aim the main purpose of this article is to introduce korean red cross recent efforts operation of the red campaigner and blood donation supporters the construction of virtual blood donation experience center the blood donation promotion program to change the blood donation culture and widen the donor base in korea and to present their effect and improvement direction 1 this article is comprised of the case study and analysis on the operation of red campaigner and blood donation supporters the construction of virtual blood donation experience center and blood donation promotion program 2 this article outlines the red campaigner and the blood donation supporters and the related programs and addresses their significance in addition describes the effect and direction for improvement presenting research related data 3 this article outlines virtual blood donation experience center construction and presents the exhibition in it and it suggests the effect and possibility on the authority of the research case that the education with fun has more considerable impact than learning by rote result to change current culture and increase positive understanding about blood donation korean red cross is making various efforts the red campaigner consisting of high school students and the blood donation supporters consisting of college students aim to influence the youth the potential blood donors to have a positive understanding of blood donation and to carry out continuous and organized publicity of its importance and safety in addition korean red cross is making a progress in the construction of the virtual blood donation experience center which is going to be completed by the end of 2013 we expect that we can achieve the educational purpose that sends a message that the blood donation is a volunteer work to save life and make future donors to recognize the blood donation as an object of not fear but interest finally the blood donation promotion program which began in 2009 is designed to encourage for general groups or organizations to participate in the blood donation campaign and to create the voluntary blood donation culture conclusion various projects operated by korean red cross contribute to widen blood donor based by changing blood donation culture in korea and are expected to make continuous contribution but these projects have a limitation that the partici-pant is restricted and continuous participation isnt progressing in terms of national participation continuous and positive endeavor to foster these projects as a national campaign should be encouraged although it is possible to increase the blood donor temporarily through one-time event when blood shortage recurs widening the donor base by changing blood donation culture should be the fundamental solution the changing blood donation culture and donor understanding may not be optimistic for a short-term blood shortage problem but will be useful to make conditions that expand the donor base and increase voluntary donors in the medium to longer term understanding our future donors is of critical importance to blood collection agencies worldwide not only do we need to know who they are but also why they do or do not engage in the required behaviour of blood product donation the surge in psychological research into blood donation in the last decade has provided significant insight into understanding the psychological factors underpinning the commencement and continuation of blood donation this review will summarise the state of our current understanding of knowing how to effectively recruit the non-donor and the complexities that lie ahead for all involved at the descriptive level and stemming from the systematic application of various psychological theories and models within blood donation contexts we now know more than ever about the key factors that non-donors report impact on their blood donation intentions and behaviour from this certain psychological elements such as perceived control or self-efficacythe individuals self perception that they can cope with donationhave emerged as key determinants of donor recruitment drawing on these results research psychologists have worked collaboratively with blood collection agencies to develop and evaluate recruitment materials designed to target these central constructs both laboratory and in field trials have been undertaken which have consistently shown positive effects for example participants receiving these materials are more likely to volunteer to donate blood than those receiving standard recruitment materials the collaboration of researchers and blood collection agencies has furthered understanding and recruitment efficacy generating measurable operational deliverables however this collaborative research has also served to highlight the challenges that lie ahead both in terms of the diversity of our non-donor population as well as the limitations of our current theoretical models further there is an increasing need for large scale randomized controlled field trials to systematically evaluate interventions designed on the basis of psychological research while these needs may provide substantial challenges for researchers and blood collection agencies alike the promise of psychology in providing the who and how to effectively recruit remains background developed countries rely solely on voluntary non-remunerated donors to ensure adequate blood supply but ageing has brought in significant pressure on the health care system including blood supply in hong kong blood demand has recorded a 17 increase in blood demand from year 2008 to 2012 with almost 60 blood being transfused to patients aged 60 therefore sourcing for more blood to meet demand is one of the most urgent issues in blood service in this report we report how we successfully modeled donation preference into the development of a new collection site to leverage the blood demand material and methods demographic information of all donors with successful donations was retrieved from blood bank computer system for the years 2004-2007 statistical analyses were performed to determine how frequent they came back to donate whether residential location affected their donation frequencies and lastly identify potential district in hong kong to build a new donor center against the donor and general population distribution results of 775690 donations made by 191302 male and 201446 female donors were analyzed on average 758 of donors donated only once during the calendar year but donors were more likely to make repeated donations at donor centers than mobile venues significantly more donors would come back for second or more donations at donor center 361 vs 201 p  005 male were more likely to come back for repeated donations than female 433 vs 309 p  005 a total of 466121 donations made at donor centers were further studied upon matching with their residential address distance from donor centers was shown to be a determining factor on their choice of donation through linear regression analysis reduced donation frequencies were observed with increasing distance from donor centers regression analysis then identified several districts where many donors had to travel a long distance to the nearest donor center the district with the highest expected increase in donations adjusted by the expected growth rate was then chosen as the site for building the new donor center a fixed donor center was so selected at yuen long district and open to donors by 29 july 2011 by the end of year 2011 6160 donations consisting of 3047 males and 3113 females were made with more than 881 collection given by donors residing at yuen long and the nearby district tuen mun when the whole year figure was reviewed in 2012 16990 donations were collected which already exceeded the planned collection target of 15000 by year 3 interestingly same 881 donations were given by donors residing at these two districts conclusion despite being a small city the retrospective analysis of donation behavior has provided valuable information in the service planning in hong kong the new donor center was able to reach the planned third-year collection target by 15 months earlier further work is being done by using the more recent data to identify the next optimal collection sites for future expansion under most best cost effective way singapore red cross singapore singapore background singapore is moving towards providing more fixed blood donation sites with the aim of enhancing donation experience and encouraging repeat donations it was recognized that the choice of location and an understanding of the human traffic in the vicinity are elements of success a 2-prong approach was undertaken to collect information on the footfalls the social profile and demographics in the designated location collect information from potential donors on their preferences and sentiments in relation to operating hours and outreach channels for marketing communications method a month-long study was conducted in the vicinity by observing and counting the human traffic the crowd density at various exitentry points at various timings the flow and direction of the general foot traffic overall make up of the surrounding district such as types of corporate civic  religious organizations operating in the vicinity and number of educational institutions in addition an on-site survey to determine potential donor preferences and sentiments in relation to operating hours tactical outreach and design mechanism of the blood centre was also conducted to help develop a tactical marketing communications strategy the results indicated that during week days about 85 of people visiting that vicinity were youths aged 16 to 25 505 and young adults aged 26 to 39 334 the main purposes of the visit were for work related activities 22 attending school 191 and shopping 381 on weekends 76 of these age groups visited the vicinity for leisure activities or to church another 24 who visited there were adults age 40-60 years old most of the respondents had a specific destinations and most of them indicated lunch time and after office hours as their preferred donation periods a tactical marketing communications strategy targeting youth and young adults was developed to meet the behavior and preferences of the target group social media platforms such as online mobile app advertising and locational media buys were employed in addition partnerships were developed with nearby educational institutions and churches to host road shows and blood donation awareness activities to engage youths and to foster fun and excitement in the social media atmosphere for the blood collection center the strategies undertaken proofed favorable as the daily attendance at the new blood collection center has surpassed its baseline target collection of 50 units of blood a day within the 3 months of its operation jan 2013 and now has a daily average collection of 60 units of blood 3a-s10-01 setting up haemovigilance programme from the very first step background national haemovigilance programmes wherever established have yielded significant data to implement blood safety initiatives settting up a national haemovigilance programme requires meticulous planning and the following issues need to be addressed whether reporting will be voluntary or mandatory what is to be reported and by whom reporting formats and data submission resources to sustain the programme staff training and responsibilities india is a country of 118 billion people 2700 blood centres one-third each in public charitable and private healthcare sectors and annual blood collection of 9 million given the diversity of blood centre management setting up such a national programme is a complex task aim to set up a national haemovigilance programme in india method the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw govt of india had launched the pharmacovigilance programme of india pvpi in july 2010 with oversight by the indian pharmacopoeia commission ipc adverse drug reaction adr monitoring centres were setup in 90 medical institutions in the country and trained staff was recruited for data collection and submission after the successful launch of pvpi the mohfw initiated the haemovigilance programme distinct from pvpi with the co-ordinating centre at national institute of biologicals nib but in close collaboration with ipc the broad organizational structure of the programme is as follows reports will be generated in the medical institution based blood centressubmitted online to the haemovigilance national co-ordinating centre at nibreports will be reviewed by the national advisory committee which will make recommendations to the national co-ordinating centre ipc for onward transmission to the regulatory authoritythe central drugs standards control organisation to formulate safety related regulatory changes and communicate to blood centres the programme was formally launched in december 2012 terms of reference of the national advisory committee are to finalize transfusion reaction reporting form trrf for the country to give expert opinion for collection collation and analysis of data and development of software for the same to monitor the quality of data collected to develop training modules and guidelines for implementation of haemovigilance programme results based on recommendations of the committee the initial focus is on reporting serious adverse reactions as defined by the working party of the international society of blood transfusion reporting is voluntary and a guidance document and trrf have been made available to the medical institution blood centres which are the designated reporting centres the reporting is online through a software -haemo-vigil accessible on the nib website each centre has been given a unique username and password for login the security of data submitted through the software has been validated reporting commenced from february 2013 and till date 434 reports of adverse reactions have been submitted the data is yet to be analysed a series of awareness workshops are planned countrywide five have already been organized specific funds have been allocated by the mohfw for this programme conclusion a well structured programme of haemovigilance has been initiated in india and is now in a phase of development 3a-s10-02 background congenital haptoglobin hp deficiency being homozygous for a deleted allele of the hp gene hpdel was identified in a japanese pregnant woman who had experienced severe anaphylactic transfusion reactions trs after infusion of red blood cells rbcs and human serum albumin in 1998 in addition the allelic frequency of hpdel was calculated to be 0015 by a genetic study of a limited number of the japanese individuals suggesting that hp deficiency might distribute among the japanese population as a phenotype of serum hp aims in this report we present the results obtained from a hemovigilance survey carried out between 1998 and 2012 in which hp deficiency was identified among japanese patients who had experienced nonhemolytic trs nhtrs and those obtained from a screening of hp-deficient japanese healthy blood donors materials and methods patients with nhtrs a total of 19675 patients who had experienced nhtrs reported by hospitals to the japanese red cross society between january 1998 and december 2012 were examined healthy blood donors a total of 272068 blood donors who visited the japanese red cross blood centers in the tokyo area between june and august 2010 were examined testing for identification of hp deficiency i serum hp concentration was determined using peak-rate nephelometry with the detection limit of 6 mgdl followed by simplified sandwich elisa with the detection limit of 3 lgdl individuals who showed a negative result of elisa were assessed as hp-deficient ii the presence of the hpdel allele was analyzed using an allele-specific pcr method testing for anti-hp antibody the anti-hp antibody produced in all the hp-deficient individuals was measured by elisa and western blot analysis it was further analyzed using ouchterlony or surface plasmon resonance technology in some cases results thirty-one individuals were identified as hp-deficient among the 19675 patients who had experienced nhtrs 016 all the patients except three who could not be tested were homozygous for the hpdel allele they were transfused blood products pc 17 ffp 1 rbcs 9 mixed 4  nineteen of them 61 experienced anaphylactic trs accompanied by severe hypotension and the other patients 39 experienced milder nhtrs all the patients except one had a history of transfusion the anti-hp igg antibody was detected in 28 patients 90 in addition to the igg antibody the anti-hp ige antibody was detected in 20 patients 64 hpdeficient individuals were identified among japanese blood donors with a prevalence of 105272068 0039 all the donors were homozygous for hpdel except one who was heterozygous for hpdel hpdelhp2 the anti-hp antibody was not detected in 104105 99 of the hp-deficient donors conclusions the higher prevalence of hp deficiency caused by hpdel -homozygosity producing the anti-hp antibody among the patients with nhtrs than in the normal donors p  0001 suggests a higher risk of such trs in hp-deficient patients hp-deficient individuals are present among normal healthy donors with a prevalence that is expected from its allele frequency they might be expected as suitable donors for hp-deficient patients to prevent hp-related anaphylaxis hlaing aa background and objective collection of the correct blood sample from the correct patient is a vital step in the process of safe blood transfusion transfusion labora- methods a study on all reports of mislabeled and miscollected specimens from january 2010 to december 2012 was undertaken and the results were analyzed mislabeled samples were defined as samples that were incorrectly labeled at the time of collection and miscollected samples were wrong blood in tube samples due to patient misidentification errors resulting in discrepancies in blood group between the current blood sample and historical records were identified by program flagging during validation of blood group results these discrepancies were resolved by requesting a second sample from the patient collected by another person some errors detected at the ward level were reported by the staff member who had sent the blood sample workload data for group and screen samples received during 2010-2012 was collected from the annual transfusion laboratory records using these data ratio of errors from mislabeled and miscollected samples to number of group and screen samples received was calculated results between january 2010 and december 2012 a total of 162999 samples were received for abo grouping of 77 incidents were recorded relating to errors in either sampling or labeling the overall sample error rate was 0047 or 1 in 2116 samples of 52 cases resulted from wrong labeling during collection 17 cases were due to patient misidentification five were errors that had occurred during the initial request in two incidents the cause could not be identified and one labeling error occurred in the laboratory all errors in labeling resulted from failure to check the pre printed name label with the label on the patients identity band in 14 incidents labeling was performed away from the bedside in 11 cases name labels of a different patient were found in the correct patients medical file in 25 cases labels were taken from wrong patients file and two errors were due to using prelabeled tubes of 17 patients had been misidentified and blood taken from the wrong person root cause for these errors was not following hospital polices in patient identification and sample collection sixty-four percent of the errors occurred out of normal working hours mainly during the night while the rest 36 had occurred during normal hours conclusion we conclude that mislabeling and miscollected sample errors represent a potential for mistransfusion in our institution the rates of mislabeled and miscollected samples can be used as key performance indicators in this important step in the clinical transfusion process this baseline data will be used in formulating standards of performance for sample collection and patient identification and for implementing risk -reducing strategies background haemovigilance is a surveillance programme dedicated for the practice of blood transfusion it is an important part of the quality system of the blood programme haemovigilance programme in malaysia was initiated as a national programme in 2003 under the ministry of health moh since its inception in 2003 the programme has evolved and has become an integral part of our transfusion service all adverse events and near misses were reported to the national coordinating haemovigilance unit at the national blood centre nbc using a standardised form and predefined criteria these were compiled and analysed into an annual report for the national background the process of blood transfusion from blood collection and processing to issue and bedside transfusion of blood components involves several areas of human participation human error is therefore inevitable in this chain of events transfusion laboratories have long focused their attention on quality control methods and quality assessment programmes dealing with analytical aspects of blood testing however there is enough evidence to suggest that the steps most prone to error are in fact in the pre and post analytical phases various international accreditation bodies now require clear and effective incident reporting protocols to enhance measures for error trapping and error avoidance aims this study aims to quantify and characterize transfusion errors in a joint commission international jci accredited tertiary care centre in india methods all reports of transfusion related errors registered in the blood bank or outside between january 2008 till december 2012 were reviewed and categorised into pre-analytical analytical and post-analytical events the process adopted at our centre for assessing transfusion related events at the patients side uses widely tested criteria of 1 incident reporting 2 root cause analysis 3 identification of corrective actions results during the study period 89156 requests for blood and blood components were received and total of 198505 blood components were issued within the hospital a total of 16834 reported errors were analysed pre-analytical errors comprised a large majority 13676 8124 most of them being errors of inadequate patient information on request forms 10976 652 followed by sampling errors 1756 104 analytical errors comprised 563 33 and post analytical errors accounted for 2595 154 of the total errors reported there was no incidence of acute haemolytic transfusion reaction or direct patient harm during the study period but on several occasions near miss events were reported which if missed could have background in australia we rely on non-remunerated voluntary donors to provide sufficient blood to meet patients needs for fresh components the australian red cross blood service blood service is unable to import components for routine use so is 100 self-sufficient hospitals and pathology laboratories are under increasing pressure from governments to improve value for money for blood and blood products which is resulting in extra demands being placed on the blood service especially in relation to lower age at issue and a continuing trend to hold more group o stock and less of the other groups especially ab with a typically seasonal inventory pattern for red cells the blood service has focussed on closer management of blood inventory aim the aim of the inventory program was to improve reliability of blood coming into the supply chain and therefore improved reliability in delivery to customers this is measured by average and variance in the number of whole blood collection packs being receipted at the processing centre the aim was to reduce the variability in this metric which would naturally lead to decreased inventory holding requirements greater control and efficiency and increased reliability and service to the customers order fulfilment is another measure used to demonstrate improvement methods in order to manage blood inventory effectively the first step was to introduce a minimum and maximum inventory level by blood type by state this provided a transparent target to aim for the bands were calculated by firstly setting a minimum inventory level using traditional supply chain safety stock calculations the next step was to develop a 12 week inventory forecast using a number of planning assumptions one of the core assumptions is the number of appointments booked in the lead up to a donation in order to improve reliability minimum tar-gets were agreed at 3 months out re-booking time through to one week out a traffic light style appointments portal was developed to provide improved visibility of appointment levels for each collection mode and by state results results show that the quarterly standard deviation of blood coming in to inventory has improved from 1711 to 1285 in the last four financial yearsa 25 reduction in addition order fulfilment has improved from 82 to 95 demonstrating that with improved planning systems and processes it is possible to manage inventory effectively the results are demonstrated in the two graphs attached summaryconclusion the blood service in australia set a goal to improve reliability of fresh components in particular red cells entering finished goods inventory to improve order fulfilment and provide service excellence to customers by implementing robust and disciplined planning and reporting systems reliability has improved which shows that there are methods available to improve the effectiveness of inventory management for blood components 3a-s11-02 wooi-seong k one of the fundamentals of a blood collection center that procures processes stores and supplies blood and blood components to hospitals or other blood banks is an effective and sound management of blood inventory as blood supply is dynamic blood supply management requires continuous monitoring and interfacing between blood procurement and inventory management and with hospitals in an effort to provide adequate safe and equitable blood supply from voluntary non-remunerated blood donors in the face of increasing demand and decreasing donor population blood collection centers are also challenged with blood shortages which unless managed could impact the healthcare delivery and negatively affect patient care in order to provide a consistent and reliable blood supply blood centres will have to resort to creative and innovative measure malaysia a unique multicultural and multiethnic country celebrates significant religious and historic events as well as commemorations as such malaysia observes numerous national and state holidays in fact malaysia is ranked as the seventh country in the world in the number of observed holidays by virtue of its geographical location malaysia is not exempt from natural and man-made disasters the most severe being seasonal monsoon floods and flash floods these and the poor response to blood donation campaigns as a result of balik kampung phenomenon during major holidays due to mass exodus of malaysians to their hometowns contribute to acute seasonal blood shortages in blood collection centers around the country as well as within the region adopting a proactive approach to blood shortages includes embracing new measures to recruit and retain blood donors establishing a blood forecast system developing a strong network among blood collection centers being transparent with the blood inventory levels which will lead to greater trust and increased confidence in bts and having a contingency plan at national blood centre nbc the blood action team was formed in 2010 it is a multidisciplinary team comprising of members from the donor education and publicity donor recruitment blood procurement component and processing and inventory divisions as well as medical officers transfusion medicine specialists and consultant meetings are held regularly and this has greatly improved the communication interdepartmentally and has fostered a team whose members are committed to improving blood supply management and preventing blood shortages through discussion and brainstorming sessions also blood forecasting is carried out as far ahead as months in advance the blood stock forecasts are also communicated to blood banks from public and private hospitals which are supplied by nbc a measure to increase transparency since the implementation of these measures nbc has successfully and effectively overcome the annual seasonal blood shortages for the last 3 years evidently blood shortages are largely preventable by adopting a proactive approach 3a-s11-03  the ct ratios were calculated and analyzed for each major department nbc and hkl had continuously introduced several interventions to reduce ct ratios during the period of this study results the overall ct ratio for hkl had been reduced from 22 in year 2005 to 19 in year 2012 the four major departments in hkl that showed high reductions in ct ratio for the same period were obstetrics and gynecology 64 reduced to 25 surgical 26 reduced to 21 orthopedic 26 reduced to 21 and neurology 38 reduced to 22 in this study interventions that had contributed to the drastic reduction in ct ratio were compliance to the maximum surgical blood order schedule msbos which was periodically updated within each department effective communication between clinician and blood bank staff and continuous medical education cme for house officers and clinicians the active hospital transfusion committee htc and hospital transfusion team htt also played an important role in reducing the ct ratio by creating awareness among the paramedics and medical officers regarding the judicious use of blood and blood products and regular monitoring and audits of the whole transfusion process starting from blood sampling to monitoring of patients during and after transfusion summaryconclusions this study showed that several interventions that have been introduced by hkl and nbc such as continuous medical education compliance with updated msbos active role of htc and htt and effective communication between clinician and blood bank staff have successfully reduced ct ratio in four major departments in hkl this successful achievement needs continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure consistency this can also be a role model that is shared with other hospitals to ensure that the ct ratio is within the set target 3a-s11-04 fusion were collected during second step a modeling and simulation were used to define the optimal rcl inventory for the metropolitan area average rc cell shelflife of regional inventory as well as the number of transfused rcs were calculated in addition it was hypothesized that an efficient turnover of rc inventory will result in inventory reduction and relatively fresh blood for the transfusion reducing the blood utilization and frequency of transfusion among non-surgical patients especially those with chronic transfusion results dynamic inventory management and application of inventory index at regional level four referral hospitals providing direct health care services to 14 and specialized services to 20 million population reduced the regional rc inventory by 32 1100 rcs to 750 rcs optimal hospital inventory index of 75 this change in inventory was accompanied by a reduction in shelf-life of transfused red cells at 36 average shelf-life of transfused rcs reduced from 345 to 221 weeks the total annual rc utilization and specific categorical data of patients prior to and after the implementation of bump 2010 and 2012 included in table 1  conclusion optimization of rc inventory by application of inventory index improved the pattern of regional blood utilization red cell utilization among chronically transfused patients was decreased by 20 average chronically transfused hematology and renal patients showed the highest reduction on rcu 21-26 p value  00001 that was no change in amount of surgical transfusions non-surgical medical category showed a mild reduction 4 but statistically was not significant the results indicate that implementation of bump could significantly improve red cell utilization among chronically transfused patients this change may also result in reduction of transfusion associated adverse reactions and long term complications like as iron overload 3a-s12-01 no abstract available 3a-s12-02 burnouf t 1  tzeng ys 2  deng sc 2  wang ch 2  tsai jc 3 and chen tm 2 1 taipei medical university taipei taiwan 2 tri-service general hospital taipei taiwan 3 tatung university taipei taiwan background approximately 15 of diabetic patients develop chronic ulcers and 25 of those may undergo foot amputation activated platelet gel which contains growth factors has been proposed as an adjunct to promote healing of small diabetic foot ulcers for large un-healing diabetic ulcers skin graft is usually needed we have demonstrated that single-donor allogeneic platelet gel and fibrin glue improve skin grafting to achieve successful persistent healing of large ulcers 1 however it is not known whether autologous platelet gel can be beneficial in this application aims to evaluate in a prospective study the safety and efficacy of using autologous platelet gel to enhance skin graft take in non-healing diabetic lower extremity ulcers methods approval was obtained from the institutional review board of our hospital eight consecutive diabetic patients aged 25-82 with nine non-healing lower extremity ulcers median size of 50 cm 2  range 15-150 cm 2  were enrolled their median duration of diabetes and ulcer was 106 years range 5-25 years and 65 months range 3-24 months none of the patients had received conventional skin grafting in the past prp was prepared from 100 ml of venous blood using sep-ax-vgr protocol biosafe sa switzerland autologous thrombin was prepared by activating 10 ml of plasma tgd-001 merries international inc taiwan skin ulcer was debrided to remove the infected and necrotic tissues and covered with moist saline dressing daily dressing change without additional treatment was performed the wound was sprayed after 7 to 10 days with equal volumes 5 to 7 ml of autologous prp and autologous thrombin to form the platelet gel within 5-10 s thin-splitthickness skin graft with multiple slits was then applied on the wound bed and fixed with staples or cat-gut sutures each patient was placed on antibiotics during the course according to wound cultural results bolster dressing with sofa-tulle were used to avoid post-graft hematoma formation negative pressure wound therapy vac was not used in this study results there was no adverse reaction during the study eight out of nine skin grafts took well 88 healing rate the interval between skin graft and complete wound healing ranged from 2 to 3 weeks in the eight successful cases no ulcer recurrence was noted during the 2-19 months follow-up period the non-successful case was an attempt to treat an ulcer that was deep to the periosteum of calcaneus bone free tissue transfer would have been required but the patient refused the microsurgery due to age and medical condition which led to skin graft loss conclusion this study shows for the first time to our knowledge the possibility to use platelet materials in combination with skin graft procedures to treat large nonhealing diabetic ulcers of lower extremity recently human platelet lysates pl rich in growth factors were shown to replace fbs for ex vivo expansion of various cells but whether they can be used for cec expansion is unknown aims to evaluate the possibility to isolate and propagate cecs ex vivo using a xenogeneic-free recombinant growth factor-free medium supplemented exclusively with human pl methods pl was prepared by cacl 2 activation of apheresis platelet concentrates from three volunteer donors and centrifuged to obtain a fibrin-free supernatant that was heat-treated 56c30 min hpl or not pl was characterized for proteins platelet growth factors pdgf-ab bdnf egf and vegf and chemical composition cecs were obtained from over 10 bovine corneas bcecs using standard procedures and grown in a dmem-f12 medium containing sodium bicarbonate selenium and antibiotics supplemented either with i 5 fbs 05 dmso 2 ngml rhu-egf 5 lgml insulin 5 lgml transferrin and 1 nm cholera toxin termed 5 fbs medium or with ii 25 5 75 or 10 pl or hpl as the only source of protein nutrients and growth factors cells were grown in duplicates in 6 24 or 96-well plates at 37c in a controlled atmosphere containing 5 co 2  with medium changes every two days viable cells were counted for 7 days and cell viability was determined by mtt assay bcec phenotype was determined by immunostaining using anti-phospho-connexin 43 anti-nak atpase alpha-1 subunit anti-zo-1 and purified anti-n-cadherin anti-mouse and anti-rabbit igg fitc were used as the second fluorescent antibodies results pl or hpl contained 55-60 mgml total proteins and a range of approximately 30-405 231-32 044-182 and 024-039 ngml of pdgf-ab bdnf egf and vegf platelet growth factors respectively cecs could be expanded in a med-ium supplemented with 25-10 pl or hpl interestingly better cell bcec morphology and adherence was found when using hpl compared to pl cell growth and mtt equivalent to that of the 5 fbs medium could be achieved only using 10 hpl in addition bcecs could be isolated from bovine corneas and subsequently expanded using the dmemf12 medium supplemented with 10 hpl bcecs expanded in the hpl-medium maintained their typical morphology adherence transparency and phenotype conclusion bcecs can be isolated and expanded ex vivo in a growth medium supplemented solely with human platelet lysate material although further studies using cec from human origin are mandatory to confirm these conclusions such findings open a possible new paradigm for gmp-compliant clinical-grade ex vivo propagation of cec and regenerative therapy protocols of human corneal endothelium platelets are the smallest and second most abundant circulating cells in the blood and their primary role is to maintain the integrity of the vasculature when blood vessel injury occurs platelet adhesion and activation receptors recognize subendothelial matrix proteins such as collagen and this can initiate a coordinated series of reactions leading to the formation of a fibrin clot to arrest bleeding it appears however that in addition to hemostasis platelets also have important inflammatory and immunological functions as early as the 1960s reports began to demonstrate that platelets may play an active role in the stimulation and regulation of immune responses for example platelets can store and secrete several pro-and anti-inflammatory chemokines eg platelet factor 4 and rantes and cytokines eg interleukin-1b and transforming growth factor-b that can affect local immune responses such as chemoattracting neutrophils to sites of tissue damage on the other hand platelets may be able to directly regulate adaptive immune responses via their ability to express and secrete cd40 cd40l co-stimulatory molecules more recent reports have also suggested that depending on their activation state platelets may be able to either suppress cd8 t cell responses or under certain circumstances present mhc class i associated peptides to activate cd8 t cells these studies have suggested that platelets represent a critical link between innate and adaptive immunity platelet mhc class i expression may also have a detrimental role by conferring tumor cell resistance against immune attack of perhaps greater interest platelets have been shown to express the entire family of tolllike receptors tlr and this may allow them to act as circulating sentinel cells that first encounter bacterial products for presentation to the innate immune system in particular surface expression of platelet tlr4 enables platelets to present lipopolysaccharide to mononuclear cells and neutrophils which modulates their phagocytic capabilities and this has implications for the development of immune platelet disorders furthermore tlr9 appears to be contained within a unique platelet granule underneath the cell surface that can be expressed by platelet activation thus elucidating the role of platelets in sepsis and a better understanding of the apparent central role that they play as immune cells may be important for the potential development of efficient therapeutic modalities against infections this lecture will highlight the many characteristics of platelets as immune-like cells will discuss how platelets may be the major controllers of immune responses macquarie university sydney australia malaria remains a major health problem in most of the tropics and is especially burdensome in economically underprivileged areas our ability to reduce the high rates of morbidity and mortality due to malaria are hampered by wanning efficacy of current antimalarial drugs and the spread of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes we desperately need a greater understanding of how the plasmodium parasite succeeds in invading and growing within red cells how the host responds to an infection and importantly the protective mechanisms employed by the host to combat the infection platelets regulate blood haemostasis but are now also regarded as an important component of the bodys early innate defense against invading microbial pathogens recently my laboratory discovered that platelets are able to protect against a malaria infection in mouse models of malaria survival to a chronic infection is reduced when platelet levels are artificially depleted purified human platelets directly bind to p falciparum-infected red cells in culture and kill parasite within our current work is exploring how platelets can kill intrerythrocytic malaria parasites i will present our current understanding of the platelet and red cell molecules involved in the killing mechanism these include the platelet cytocidal molecule platelet factor 4 pf4 and the erythrocyte duffy-antigen molecule which binds pf4 and mediates the platelet killing effect the critical requirement of duffy has lead us to propose that platelet-mediated protection against p falciparum infection is compromised in individuals homozygous for the common duffy-antigen negative allele 3c-s13-01 graduate school of medicine the university of tokyo tokyo japan although bleeding is a major side effect of heparin which is used for treatment of thrombosis heparin also causes a prothrombotic adverse drug reaction called heparininduced thrombocytopenia hit hit is caused by the development of platelet-activating antibodies hit antibody which is directed against the heparin and platelet factor 4 pf4 complex these reactions accelerate platelet activation and coagulation leading to thrombosis thus if hit is strongly suspected clinically in cases of thrombocytopenia and thromboembolism that occur during or after heparin therapy it is vital to stop all heparins and start administering an alternative antithrombotic drug immediately in japan a test to screen for hit antibody the automated immunoassays based on two types of chemiluminescent immunoassay and a latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay was approved as a clinical laboratory test in the medical insurance system in september 2012 only the latex agglutination test is now widely used clinically because of its simplicity convenience and cost-effectiveness however these immunological methods including enzyme immunoassays eias which detect binding of antibodies to immobilized pf4heparin complexes may not be employed suitably the immunological hit tests are useful in diagnosing hit because of their high sensitivity however they also often cause overdiagnosis of hit the value of the selected cut-offs is the key element in ruling out hit consequently hit should be confirmed through laboratory detection of platelet-activating antibodies by using functional assays for the hit antibody it must also be diagnosed based on careful consideration of the clinical picture in order to diagnose hit properly our laboratory asks clinicians to assess the pretest probability of hit by using the scoring system the 4t scoring thrombocytopenia timing thrombosis and other explanations furthermore our expert staff ensures that the diagnosis is correctly performed since hit has not been fully recognized in clinical practice in japan as compared to in western countries the functional assay for hit antibody has been regarded as the gold standard for diagnosing hit in patients in spite of its disadvantages the platelet activation test procedure is cumbersome the tests are technically challenging and limited to specialized laboratories additionally the most important requirement for the test is the selection of platelet donors with high reactivity to the platelet activation antibodies accordingly in japan there are very few places where the functional assay is conducted whereas many institutions still assess patients with only the immunological assay in our laboratory the heparin-induced platelet aggregation method is performed as isotopes such as radiolabeled serotonin release assay should not be commonly used in routine laboratories in an attempt to improve the sensitivity of the functional assay we developed two methods for increasing hit antibody reactivity in donor platelets one is the cooling donor platelet method used for improving reactivity and the other a way of donor selection by using monoclonal hit antibody further studies are necessary to introduce a simple assay method in ordinary laboratory testing to detect platelet-activating antibodies 3c-s13-02 autoimmune or immune thrombocytopenia itp is an acquired bleeding disorder with a low platelet count mediated by immune-mediated mechanisms this condition is seen in patients with various associated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and can also occur without an underlying disease production of igg autoantibodies to platelet surface glycoproteins such as gpiibiiia and gpib is the hallmark of the disease it has been thought that anti-platelet autoantibodies promote platelet clearance in the reticuloendothelial system but recent findings indicate that anti-platelet antibodies also suppress megakaryogenesis resulting in impaired platelet production the diagnosis of itp continues to be one of exclusion several antigen-specific assays for detection of anti-gpiibiiia and anti-gpib antibodies are reported to be useful in identifying itp patients but these assays require complicated procedures such as platelet solubilization and use of commercially unavailable monoclonal antibodies to solve these problems we have developed an enzyme-linked immunospot elispot assay for detection of circulating b cells secreting igg anti-gpiibiiia and gpib antibodies which is a sensitive specific and convenient method for evaluating the anti-platelet autoantibody response in addition reticulated platelets and circulating thrombopoietin tpo are useful in evaluating platelet production status these findings led us to propose preliminary diagnostic criteria for itp based on a combination of itp-associated laboratory findings including erythrocyte and leukocyte counts anti-gpiibiiia antibody-producing b cells platelet-associated anti-gpiibiiia antibodies percentage of reticulated platelets and plasma tpo although the etiology of itp remains unknown complex dysregulation of the immune system is observed in itp patients based on a series of experiments using cd4 t cells reactive with gpiibiiia derived from itp patients we have proposed a continuous pathogenic loop model as a mechanism that explains ongoing antiplatelet antibody response in itp patients this model includes b cells that produce anti-platelet antibodies reticuloendothelial macrophages that phagocytose opsonized platelets via fcc receptors and present platelet-derived antigenic peptides and platelet-reactive cd4 t cells that exert their helper activity upon recognition of the antigenic peptides once this pathogenic loop is established anti-platelet antibody production would go on endlessly recently regulatory systems that control this pathogenic loop are attracting a great deal of attention a series of studies in itp patients have found that foxp3 regulatory t cells are reduced in circulation bone marrow and spleen and are deficient in their suppressive function in addition a critical role of regulatory t cells in preventing the anti-platelet autoimmune response has been demonstrated in mice deficient in regulatory t cells which spontaneously develop anti-platelet autoantibody-mediated thrombocytopenia in addition our recent analysis indicates that the eradication of helicobacter pylori leads to up-regulated expression of inhibitory fccgriib on macrophages resulting in the attenuation of the pathogenic loop therefore therapeutic strategies aimed at interrupting this pathogenic loop would inhibit anti-platelet autoantibody production and subsequent increase in platelet count in fact current treatment regimens for itp including corticosteroids splenectomy and rituximab are able to suppress the pathogenic loop interestingly tpo mimietics have a potential to induce peripherally induced regulatory t cells resulting in suppression of the pathogenic loop 3c-s13-03 seguchi s 1  maeda t 1  kanaumi y 1  kawamura s 1  kodama m 1  kawai t 1  okazaki h 2 and miyata s 1 1 national cerebral and cardiovascular center osaka japan 2 the university of tokyo hospital tokyo japan background heparin-induced thrombocytopenia hit is a devastating immunemediated thromboembolic complication of heparin therapy heparin administration can cause conformational changes in platelet factor 4 pf4 resulting in the production of anti-pf4heparin antibodies a subset of these antibodies can activate platelets and monocytes hit antibodies leading to thrombocytopenia and a thrombininduced hypercoagulable state up to half of hit patients suffer from arterial or venous thrombosis if platelet concentrates are transfused into hit patients it is conceivable that the transfused platelets can be activated by the same mechanisms that affect the patients own platelets and trigger the onset of new thromboembolism or exacerbate hit-associated thromboembolism thus platelet transfusion is thought to be contraindicated in acute hit patients however it remains uncertain whether platelet transfusion is a risk factor for thrombosis in hit patients since only a few studies have investigated this issue systematically aim the goal is to clarify whether platelet transfusion increases the risk of thrombosis in hit patients methods we constructed a nationwide registry for hit with the approval of the ethical review committee between august 2008 and may 2013 329 patients from 185 hospitals clinically suspected of having hit were retrospectively included in the registry with clinical information such as changes in platelet count timing of heparin administration episodes of transfusion thromboembolic events and the results of serological assays for hit antibodies hit was definitely diagnosed by the detection of anti-pf4heparin igg with platelet-activating properties at a therapeutic heparin concentration but not at a high heparin concentration or with anti-fccriia antibodies the assay was performed using washed platelets prepared from hit antibody-sensitive healthy volunteers at a reference laboratory we examined patients who received transfusions of platelet concentrates after hit was suspected results of the 329 patients 85 patients were ultimately diagnosed with hit 258 optical density values of anti-pf4heparin antibodies detected by elisa were significantly higher in hit patients than in non-hit patients 23 ae 095 vs 036 ae 053 for iggam p  0001 168 ae 080 vs 025 ae 037 for igg p  0001 the incidence of thromboembolic events was significantly higher in hit patients 518 than that in non-hit patients 283 p  0001 among the 85 hit patients 20 patients received platelet transfusions after the onset of hit only two of them experienced a thromboembolic event after platelet transfusion one within 24 h and the other after 9 days notably neither patient was being treated with a thrombin inhibitor at the time the incidence of thromboembolic events in hit patients who received platelet transfusions was not significantly higher compared to hit patients who did not receive platelet transfusion or non-hit patients who received platelet transfusions after the suspicion of hit arose respectively conclusions to our best knowledge this is the first systematic report that clarifies the clinical impact of platelet transfusion on the occurrence of thromboembolic events in acute hit patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by a washed plateletactivating assay even in acute hit patients who possess platelet-activating antibodies the transfusion of platelet concentrates does not appear to increase the risk of thromboembolism especially while on thrombin inhibitor therapy 3c-s13-04 lu p ling b and li rs background transfusion platelet matches with antigenic similarity would evoke less allorecognition and immune activation strategies have been based on the theory that

background immunization against cd36 leads to the production of anti-nak a antibodies associated with fetalneonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia fnait platelet transfusion refractoriness ptr and post-transfusion purpura ptp however no data regarding the clinical relevance of cd36 immunization is currently available for chinese population study design and methods platelets and monocytes derived from 998 healthy blood donors were typed for cd36 deficiency using flow cytometry in addition four patients with suspected fnait one case and ptr three cases were investigated nucleotide sequencing was performed to identify the mutations underlying the cd36 deficiency transfection in mammalian cells hek-293t with cd36 mutated constructs was conducted to confirm these results anti-nak a antibodies were screened by the use of platelet solid-phase kit pak-plus gti diagnostics results of 18998 blood donors failed to express cd36 on their platelets surface in 512 individuals no cd36 expression was detected both on platelets and monocytes suggesting that the frequencies of type i cd36 deficiency platelets and monocytes and type ii cd36 deficiency platelets only were approximately 05 and 13 respectively nucleotide sequencing analysis of type i cd36 deficient individuals revealed eight different mutations four of them were not described so far however 1228-1239del attgtgcctatt and 329-330delac appeared to be the most common mutations related to type i cd36 deficiency in south chinese population further analysis showed that the presence of anti-nak a antibodies in one healthy donor donor 1 as well as in three cases of ptr patients 2-4 and one case of fnait patient 1 these results could be confirmed by immunoprecipitation using biotinylated platelets and by antigen capture assay with stable transfected cd36 cell lines in all ptr patients transfusion with platelets derived from cd36 negative donors resulted in good increment 24 h ppr 20 table 1 shows the mutations found in these five gpiv defective individuals conclusions more than 05 of cd36 type i deficient individuals are at risk to be immunized through blood transfusion or pregnancy in china in this study we could demonstrate that this immunization is of clinical relevance for the development of ptr and fnait therefore testing of anti-nak a antibodies should be considered in suspected immune mediated thrombocytopenia a national registry of cd36 deficient blood donors should be established to maintain bleeding disorders associated with anti-nak a antibodies since immunization against cd36 is conceivable for other asian populations an international network within laboratories in south asian region should be established in the future 3c-s14-01 do we really need ffp the evolving role of pf24 and pre-thawed plasma devine d fresh frozen plasma ffp is defined as plasma frozen within 8 hours of collection while this product maintains a high functional activity of both coagulation factors and anticoagulant proteins there has been recent movement in some jurisdictions away from reliance on ffp in many blood systems an increasing role for plasma frozen within 24 h of collection fp24 is seen such plasma shows little difference in functional protein levels when compared to ffp with the exception of fviii levels which a show time related decay of activity even factor viii loss can be consistently minimized if whole blood is held on controlled rate cooling plates prior to preparation of fp24 in addition the activity profiles of coagulation proteins in fp24 prepared in routine production closely resemble those of commercial pooled plasma products taken together these observations have led many blood systems to move from the exclusive use of ffp to a mix of inventory of ffp and fp24 if not to the complete removal of ffp from their menu of offerings the preparation of cryoprecipitate has also been a driver for the retention of plasma frozen within 8 h of collection since the most common labeling of cryoprecipitate has focused on the content of both fibrinogen and factor viii in part owing to original role of the latter in the treatment of hemophilia a collection of ffp has persisted as the starting material for cryoprecipitate production in jurisdictions where hemophilia or other factor viii deficiencies are treated with factor concentrates the labeling of cryoprecipitate to emphasize its antihemophilic factor activity is no longer warranted as data began to accumulate on fp24 similar studies began to appear that investigated the effect of prolonged cold storage of plasma that had been thawed this led to the introduction in some jurisdictions of the extension of the allowable period of use for thawed plasma from 24 h to up to 5 days if stored at 4c such practice is increasingly widespread and there is no evidence that patients receiving such products are compromised from the perspective of health resources management the use of both fp24 and pre-thawed plasma reduces discard of products or prevents the use of these products in non-group specific recipients with the advent of massive transfusion protocols which may require pre-thawed plasma at the ready it also allows better use of relatively scarce but high demand products such as ab plasma this presentation will focus on a review of the relevant studies of plasma quality for ffp fp24 and pre-thawed plasma we will review the appropriate uses of these different components as well as groups of patients for whom specific products should be restricted or supplemented 3c-s14-02 background in 2008 the australian red cross blood service blood service began a programme of process improvement aimed at maximising the manufacture of clinical plasma components from male donors which is a key mitigation to the risk of trali transfusion related acute lung injury the challenge of sourcing all clinical plasma from male donors is exacerbated in australia due to its adherence to the council of europe guidelines that stipulate a maximum allowable time between collection and freeze of apheresis-derived clinical plasma of six hours which is considerably more stringent than for most other blood services despite the greater tyranny of distance that exists in australia aim the aim of the programme was to achieve a result of 100 of clinical plasma sourced from male only donors methods work began in early 2008 to gather detailed quantitative data that linked information on donor panel to collection centre to production facility and that could be broken down by blood group and by day of the week this was then formulated into a suite of reports highlighting opportunities and variance in performance based on those reports a cross-functional team designed a range of improvement initiatives across disciplines such as transport systems enhancements donor acquisition and processing such as incoming blood donation shippers were marked with colour coded labels that notified the receiving production facility of clinical suitability this assisted with prioritisation and workflow management additional deliveries of blood from collection centres to processing centres a range of targeted campaigns and marketing collateral were produced to attract male donors to apheresis plasma donation donor centre collection staff were trained to convert male ab donors over to plasmapheresis donation activity changes to progesa to prevent manufacture of female plasma were made after a time results the first report in july 2008 showed that the blood service were issuing 8771 male clinical plasma the group ab rate was 5786 the results improved dramatically by november 2010 in groups o a and b 9964 9972 and 9962 respectively allowing for progesa to be configured to prevent the routine manufacture of female plasma from those groups whilst still allowing supervisor over-ride by march 2012 the results in group ab had improved to 9777 chart below and the directive was given to manufacture male clinical plasma only as routine january 2013 was the first month ever where 100 of all clinical plasma was sourced from male donors only in 201213 9998 of clinical plasma was male onlythe 002 constituted short lead time requests for iga deficient plasma subsequent to a system change that allowed for a donor identification marker for iga deficient donors inventory levels of this sub-product have increased by 34 negating the need to turn female production on to accommodate sporadic demand summaryconclusion the multi-disciplinary efforts over an extended period of time have resulted in the practical removal of the risk of trali in australia this is an achievement that many thought impossible and one that many other blood services have been unable to attain results quality control qc parameters were measured in the prepared blood components and were listed in table 1  by standardising bc volume and haematocrit in the primary separation recovery of red cells and plasma was optimised in both the red cells in sagm and plasma units while wbc and rbc contamination levels in pc and plasma were maintained low all parameters were well within the blood component specifications set out in the council of europe guide 16th edition the standard adopted by hkrcbts qc parameters of the pathogen reduction-treated platelet concentrates in pas so produced were also within the hkrcbts blood component specifications low contamination with red cells and white cells were demonstrated and the ph range was acceptable after 5 days of storage at 20-24c the new tb production method for the separation of 450-ml quadruple wb and the preparation of intercept platelet concentrates in ssp pas was successfully developed and can be applied to the production of high quality blood components in preparation for clinical evaluation of the pathogen reduction-treated platelet concentrates 3c-s15-01 blood donors are healthy volunteers who give whole blood or blood components by apheresis for altruistic motives they should be managed in a way that ensures high standards of care nevertheless there are recognized adverse reactions that can occur during blood donation the overall incidence of complications directly related to blood donation is 1 they are generally more common in women in younger and in first-time donors although the incidence seems to be small it is of great importance considering the large number of people giving blood each day worldwide adverse blood donation reactions can generally be minimized or avoided by appropriate donor selection and care and appropriately trained staff vasovagal episodes and soft tissue injuries bruiseshaematomas at the venepuncture site are the most common donor reactions the majority of these are minor and donors usually recover quickly however these reactions can be of concern to donors and reassurance should be provided other reactions include nerve injury and arterial puncture which although less frequent may require medical care outside the blood service and may lead to prolonged symptoms or incapacity staff should be trained to recognize and manage such adverse reactions including the provision of first aid the incidence of bruising should be monitored so that further venepuncture training may be provided to staff as necessary iron deficiency in regular blood donors has been a top donor health and safety concern in many countries as each donation causes a loss of 213-236 mg of iron repeat donation can lead to a continuous depletion of body iron stores studies have shown that donation frequency had the greatest impact on iron deficiency and further risk factors were lower weight and female gender to address this issue many blood services encourage donors to take iron-rich food andor give them iron supplements adverse reactions such as delayed faint may occur after the donor leaves the donation venue donors should be advised to inform the donor centre staff of any ill-effects they suffer after donating a system for the reporting and investigation of adverse donor events and reactions should be in place as part of the donor haemovigilance system all adverse events and reactions in donors should be identified documented and reported these data should be regularly analysed for possible corrective and preventive actions the goal of donor haemovigilance is to reduce the occurrence of adverse events and reactions and improve the outcomes both for donors and patients for various reasons even today donors often do not receive detailed information on the blood donation procedure and possible complications not only do blood services have the ethical duty to inform donors of possible adverse events to enable them to give informed consent and take action for preventing adverse effects protecting the safety of donors is also important for donor retention because a safe and good donation experience ensures donors will return regularly 3c-s15-02 wiersum-osselton jc trip national hemo-and biovigilance office the hague the netherlands background without blood donations and the availability of blood transfusion many important therapeutic advances could not have been achieved donor hemovigilance is the systematic monitoring of adverse reactions and incidents in the whole chain of blood donor care with a view to improving quality and safety for blood donors method this global update draws on work by the international haemovigilance network and international society for blood transfusion haemovigilance working party experience in the netherlands as well as a pubmed search using terms blood donor and adverse reaction results are discussed for vasovagal reactions needlerelated complications long-term morbidity donor iron status and frequent apheresis results and discussion the occurrence of vasovagal reactions is associated with young female donors lower body weight and estimated blood volume first-time donor status a reduction of vasovagal reactions has been documented with use of a water drink before donation muscle tensing social distraction and lower collection volume for donors with small estimated blood volume needle injury is relatively frequent as a cause in cases of long-term morbidity needle injury is associated with traumatic phlebotomy and in some cases nerve damage is documented repeated whole blood donations lead to reduction of body iron stores and in some cases anaemia some blood services adjust donation intervals to avoid or reduce this while others have or are considering a policy of iron replacement therapy fewer studies on acute complications in plasma and other types of apheresis have been published preliminary studies of bone density and protein levels in non-commercial frequent plasma donors have not substantiated any specific hazard despite theoretical concerns of calcium or protein depletion international collaboration in strengthening donor vigilance definitions and data analysis may in future increase potential for study of risk factors and measures to improve donor care worldwide conclusion donor vigilance is gaining international interest and has increased knowledge of risk factors for vasovagal reactions associated with blood donation there remains a need of research and of developing preventive measures including prevention and treatment of needle injury as well as possible long-term effects of frequent donation assuming that these donors were newly infected it is crucial for bts to monitor the prevalence of this category of donors in order to strategize specific measures to these targeted groups to improve blood safety aims this study aimed to profile blood donors who donated during the hiv serological window period and to identify the risk factors of these blood donors methods past donor records of blood donors who had donated blood during the hiv serological window period nat ultrio and discriminatory detected and negative for both anti-hiv and p24 antigen at nbc or at blood mobiles organized by nbc from november 2007 until july 2013 were retrieved and analyzed using spss 150 results a total of 18 donors were nat detected and negative for anti-hiv and p24 antigen none in 2007 2 in 2008 2 in 2009 1 in 2010 6 in 2011 4 in 2012 and 3 in 2013 introduction in pakistan the predominant reliance for blood supply is on the replacement donors as sufficient numbers of voluntary blood donors are not available an increase in the proportion of voluntary donors following the promotion of the concept of voluntary non-remunerated blood donation vnrbd will enhance safety and will also help to shift the responsibility for arranging blood availability from the patients to the health care system objective the objective of the current study was to promote vnrbd through a public awareness campaign pac based on a thorough analysis of the knowledge attitudes and practices kap of a key segment of the society ie 18-25 years old college and university students material and methods a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted over a period of three months jan-mar 2012 multi-stage random cluster sampling approach was followed and college and university students were targeted through 20 university based blood donor organisations bdos out of a total 56 bdos identified all the participants voluntarily participated in the study and informed consent was obtained orally a pre-tested questionnaire comprising of 28 questions related to knowledge attitudes and practices was applied the questionnaire was kept anonymous and each question included multiple options or statements statistical analysis was conducted by the assistance of statistical package for social sciences spss software version 17 results a majority 65 of the students had heard about blood donation through familyfriends and a minority 9 through the internet although 45 preferred internet as spare time activity majority 85 of the students had access to the internet and mobile phone more than 50 of the respondents had donated blood 22 donated for family relatives or friends 4 donated voluntarily as an act of altruism and 25 donated voluntarily once and then stopped donating but 55 of these respondents still considered themselves as volunteer blood donors 35 indicated that important people in their environment had an influence on crucial decisions that they made motivation for blood donation was a desire to help other people 73 28 followed friends invitations in 21 cases respondents family or friends had received blood transfusions 16 followed the example of fellow students restriction for blood donation 40 generally feared donation 25 had a specific fear of the needle 20 had no confidence in the public health sector 25 condemned blood selling practice 14 had no confidence in the donation procedure hygiene 13 experienced parental discouragement conclusion to overcome the apprehensions and fears of the donors it is important to provide adequate information about donation to potential donors this strategy will help convince family replacement donors to become vnrbd and also recruit healthy individuals to become a vnrbd the approaches and strategies for this transition can be based on the findings of the study the reported preference for internet as leisure time activity suggests that internet can be utilized as an important tool for information dissemination in a pac for which detailed study is required 3d-s16-01 murphy mf platelet refractoriness is the repeated failure to obtain satisfactory responses to platelet transfusions there are immune and non-immune causes of platelet refractoriness the main immune cause is hla alloimmunisation which occurs predominantly in females with a history of pregnancy other immune causes include hpa alloimmunisation abo incompatibility platelet autoantibodies and drug-related platelet antibodies the incidence of alloimmune platelet refractoriness due to hla antibodies has declined due to leucocyte-reduction of blood components and more aggressive treatment for patients with haematological malignancies and other cancers in current practice platelet refractoriness is mainly due to shortened platelet survival associated with non-immune clinical factors such as infection and its treatment with antibiotics and antifungal drugs dic and splenomegaly if there are poor responses to hla-matched platelet transfusions the reasons should be sought including hla incompatibility which is most likely to occur in patients with unusual hla types with few well-matched donors non-immune platelet consumption and hpa and abo incompatibility further serological investigations including testing for hpa antibodies may be used to differentiate between these possibilities depending on the results the appropriate management could be the use of abo-identical or hpa-matched platelet concentrates if the specificity of the hpa antibodies can be identified platelet crossmatching may be helpful in some patients with non-specific hpa antibodies the management of patients with hla andor hpa alloimmunisation and no compatible donors may be very difficult there is no evidence that alloimmunised patients benefit from incompatible platelet transfusions which do not produce an increase in the platelet count and prophylactic platelet support should be discontinued if bleeding occurs platelet transfusions from random donors or the bestmatched donors despite being incompatible may reduce the severity of haemorrhage although increased doses of platelets may be required other management approaches such as the use of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin splenectomy and plasma exchange have not been shown to be effective the management of patients with non-immune platelet consumption is similarly problematic the usual practice is to continue with daily platelet transfusions as prophylactic platelet support but it is not known whether this approach is effective or whether platelet transfusions should be discontinued or the dose of platelets increased 3d-s16-02 managing bleeding in cardiac surgery despite major advances in the management of perioperative blood conservation transfusion rates in cardiac surgery remain very high with large variations among individual centres among all major surgical procedures cardiac surgery with cpb still consumes a large part of the available blood supply in england indicated that 10-15 of the blood units supplied by the national blood service is used in cardiac surgery units in the usa nearly 20 of blood transfusions are associated with cardiac surgery during the early history of cardiac surgery patients received large amounts of allogeneic blood in the 50s most operations were performed to correct congenital heart disease during the 60s and 70s the introduction of satisfactory valve prosthesis and direct grafting for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease led to rapid growth in the scope and number of patients having open heart surgery in the 80s pharmacological methods to reduce bleeding were introduced and the focus of blood conservation was expanded to include blood components as well as red cells with increasing application of cardiac surgery in acutely ill older patients with more comorbidities as well as the increasing safety of blood supply have contributed to an increasing incidence of allogeneic transfusions not surprisingly physicians surgeons and anaesthesiologists have shown a great interest in the promotion of safe and effective alternatives to the transfusion of allogeneic blood in cardiac surgery perioperative risk factors for allogeneic transfusion can be regrouped in three main categories factors affecting the patients preoperative rbc mass factors affecting the perioperative blood losses and factors affecting the transfusion practice the ability to predict a patients risk for transfusion allows modification of patient management with the goal of decreasing allogeneic transfusions using the trac and trust scoring system predicts candidates likely for transfusion diminished rbc mass appears to be one of the strongest predictors of transfusion the acceptance of a lower postoperative haematocrit in ijn the hct on bypass is 20-25 and post bypass is 25 or haemoglobin concentration represent an important element in current blood conservation practice the decision to transfuse a patient cannot be based only on haematocrit concentration optimizing preoperative rbc mass involves the early detection of anaemia and its correction before surgery preoperative autologous blood donation can be used to conserve allogeneic blood besides economic concerns one essential argument against pad is the lack of sufficient time because of the uncertainty of waiting list erythropoietin has also been used to augment pad in elective cardiac surgery acute normovolaemic haemodilution anh aims at reducing allogeneic blood exposure through a reduction in the net red blood cell mass lost during or just after surgery perioperative cell salvage cs also aims at reducing allogeneic blood exposure through a reduction in perioperative blood loss antifibrinolytics ltranexamic acid or epsilon aminoaproic acid or serine protease inhibitors aprotininnow unavailable may reduce excessive fibrinolysis and platelet dysfunction the use of activated f vii has been reported in intractable bleeding post cardiac surgery  3d-s17-01 the university of tokyo tokyo japan antibodies against human neutrophil antigens hna are involved in the pathogenesis of immune neutropenia such as neonatal alloimmune neutropenia nan refractoriness to granulocyte transfusions and transfusion reactions such as febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury trali the hna systems are assigned to five antigen groups namely hna-1 to 5 hna-1 -2 and -3a alloantibodies have been implicated in the pathogenesis of trali and especially hna-3a alloantibody has been found in the severe cases requiring artificial ventilation or with fatal reactions besides alloantibodies to hna-1 -2 and -3 those against hna-4a and hna-5a have been implicated in nan the identification of the causative antibodies is essential for the diagnosis as well as for the prevention of these disorders the detection of hna antibodies has been mainly dependent on cell-based assays so far among them the granulocyte agglutination test gat the granulocyte immunofluorescence test gift and the monoclonal antibody immobilization of granulocyte antigens maiga are the most commonly applied according to the isbt working party on granulocyte immunobiology the combination of gat and gift is presently the best means of hna antibody detection gift is usually more sensitive than gat however hna-3a antibodies associated with severe cases of trali are better detectable by gat in gat and gift the presence of hla antibodies with broad specificities may affect the detection of hna antibodies on the other hand the maiga assay allows the differentiation between hna and hla antibodies these classical methods however require fresh neutrophils from hna-typed donors also these assays are time-consuming which makes them not appropriate for the large-scale antibody screening in our lab we modified the mixed-passive hemagglutination mpha assay the method largely applied in japan for platelet antigenantibody detection for the detection of hna antibodies recently alternative assays have been developed including elisa with recombinant hna rhna and immunofluorescence tests with transfectant cells of hna hna-1 -2 -4 and -5 more recently the molecular basis of hna-3 antigen has been elucidated and stable cell lines expressing hna-3 antigens became available these cell lines seem to have low background and do not express detectable levels of hla antigens which make the identification of hna antibodies easier additionally kits that use luminex microbeads coated with hna antigen are being developed these kits however do not include hna-3 antigens these new technologies significantly help improving the detection and identification of hna antibodies and allow the large scale screening of hna antibodies contributing for the reduction of the risk of the pathological conditions associated with hna antibodies especially trali however these new technologies significantly increase the cost of the tests presently although many assays have been developed the standard hna antisera are not necessarily available in every lab which makes their validation difficult to be conducted thus the collaborative study among the various labs by exchanging the available antisera and comparing the test results is essential for the improvement of this field 3d-s17-02 one of the main sites where pmns carry out vital to surveillance functions is in the lungs the large surface area of the lung is needed for gaseous exchange but lungs also present a vital direct mechanical barrier to the external environment to patrol and protect this interface about 28 of the bodys total pmns are located in the pulmonary microvasculature illness may increase the number of lung pmns as well as change their phenotype from quiescent to primed in trali the transfusion of blood products with either pmn reactive antibodies or biological response modifiers can activate this concentration of primed pmns to produce an augmented respiratory burst this causes injury to the pulmonary microvasculature and consequently the symptoms of trali circulating antibodies to pmns also can compromise their numbers and function pmns carry human neutrophil antigens hna as well as class i hla which can become targets for pmn reactive antibodies the granulocyte immunofluorescence test gift and granulocyte agglutination test gat are primary tools for investigating these pmn reactions as they are able to detect reaction of hna as well as some hla class i antibodies immune neutropenias alloimmune neonatal neutropenia ann occurs when a neonates pmns are destroyed by transferred maternal antibodies developed against an inherited paternal neutrophil antigen this is similar to haemolytic disease of the newborn but importantly can occur with the first pregnancy in early childhood some children develop severe neutropenia as a result of pmn auto-antibodies although the pathogenesis of such chronic benign autoimmune neutropenia is still not understood most of these autoantibodies demonstrate specificity for the hna system passively acquired autoimmune neutropenia wherein pmns are destroyed by maternal pmn auto-antibodies crossing the placenta are a rare finding hna specificity is unlikely autoimmune neutropenia in adults is either primary secondary to another autoimmune disease or drug related it can present a clinical and diagnostic challenge as many adults invariably have alloantibodies to neutrophils and the patients neutrophil count is too low to make a definitive identification of a self reactive autoantibody hna specificity is extremely rare the severity of trali and immune neutropenias demand rapid and precise diagnosis with reliable neutrophil serology the isbt granulocyte immunobiology working party maintains a list of granulocyte immunobiology reference laboratories around the world 3d-s17-03 when seven sera from 778 donors were screened for neutrophil specific antibodies 9 samples showed positive reaction these results however could not be confirmed by gift and gat conclusions in this study we found alloimmunization against hla class i and ii in 46 male43 nulliparous and139 parous females in contrast alloimmunization against hna was not detectable in this cohort these results indicate that the use of plasma containing blood products from parous females without hla antibodies pre-testing may increase the risk of trali reaction although alloimmunization against hna seems to be a rare event in china further observation is necessary to exclude the necessity of hna antibodies screening in our blood products it is becoming clear that the ccn family of extracellular proteins play an important role in the health and function of several cells of the hematopoietic lineage ccn2 also known as connective tissue growth factor ctgf has recently been found to be in high abundance in platelets and released upon activation an effect inhibited by aspirin suggesting a role in blood clotting andor wound healing on the other hand ccn3 also known as nephroblastoma-overexpressed nov has been found to play an important role in hematopoietic stem cell health and function in fact treatment with ccn3 has recently been shown to promote hematopoietic potential a discovery with dramatic clinical potential initially using bioinformatics our laboratory has discovered a signaling pathway that connects these two discoveries and appears to be a key functional node within the development of blood cells specifically we have found that the myeloid zinc finger protein 1 mzf1 is a transcription factor that trans-activates both ccn2 and ccn3 in distinct cell types for example we have shown that mzf1 can stimulate ccn2 production and secretion in stromal fibroblasts which is then taken up by megakaryocytes and loaded into platelets this is the first time that ccn2 loading into developing platelets has been directly achieved and observed in vitro secondly we have discovered that mzf1 also regulates the synthesis of ccn3 in several hematopoietic cell types putting these results together with previous data suggests a new and immediately testable clinical treatment it is known that both vitamin d calcitriol and vitamin a all-trans retinoic acid stimulate transcription of the mzf1 gene we also have new data exploring the mechanism and suggesting other pharmacological ligands we have confirmed that treatments with either vitamin a or d activate this pathway and results in increased production of ccn2 in stromal fibroblasts which in turn results in enhanced loading of ccn2 into developing platelets in vitro similarly we have observed that both vitamin a and vitamin d induce ccn3 expression through mzf-1 and we are currently testing if this will lead to enhanced hematopoietic potential this work could impact the efficacy of blood donation and transfusion bone marrow transplants and the treatment of bleeding and clotting diseases as well as lymphomas and leukemias 3d-s18-05 background foxp3  t regulatory cells tregs consisting of natural and induced treg subsets play a crucial role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis against self-antigen while recent studies demonstrated that natural tregs are instable and dysfunctional in the inflammatory condition induced tregs itregs may have a different feature furthermore it was reported that tolerogenic dendritic cells tdcs could expand itregs in vitro and this action designed to correct defects in numbers or functions of itregs may be therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in this study the suppression efficacy of tgf-beta-induced tregs expanded by tdcs in vitro and in mouse model of autoimmune arthritis was determined method in vitro first cd4 cd25 t cells were purified from splenocytes of d1 mice and stimulated by anti-cd3cd28 in the presence of tgf-b1 for 5 days which were termed itreg and tdcs derived from bone marrow of d1 mice were induced by gm-csf il-10 and tgf-b1 and harvested after 10-day cultivation then itregs were expanded by tdcs at the ratio 51 and collected after 4 days termed itreg tdc  the phenotype proliferation suppression of cd4t proliferation induction of foxp3  tregs from foxp3 t cells and suppression of th17 cell differentiation were assessed for in vivo experiments the animal models of ra were established in this model arthritis was induced in d1 mice after immunized with bovine type ii collagen cii on day 0 and day 21 termed collagen-induced arthritis cia and 1 9 10 6 itregs or itreg tdc cells were transferred iv into cia recipient mice when cia onset control mice were treated with pbs clinical and histopathologic scores cytokine and anti-cii antibody secretion in serum and cd4  th subsets were analyzed results after 5-day induction in vitro the percent of foxp3  itregs increased from 98 ae 15 to 549 ae 25 and these itregs could be expanded effectively by tdc in additional 5-day co-incubation which continued to express higher levers of foxp3 82 ae 36 and increased 417 ae 017 fold compared with itregs the itreg tdc cells showed stronger inhibitory effect and could prompt cd4t cells converting to foxp3  itreg and resistant to th17 cell differentiation more effectively during the 4-weekobservation-period a more remarkable anti-arthritic activity improved clinical scores and histological end-points were found in the itreg tdc -treated group than those in itreg-treated group serological levels of tnf-a il-6 il-17 and anti-cii antibodies were also significantly lower and tgf-b production were higher in cia mice following adoptive transfer of itreg tdc cells as compared with itregs moreover the itreg tdc treatment resulted in an increase in the number of tregs cd4 foxp3 and a decrease in the percentage of th17 cells cd4 il-17 more obviously conclusion these results indicated that itregs expanded by tdcs showed more effective suppression in vitro and reduced more markedly the severity and progression of cia than itregs this reduction was associated with modulating inflammatory cytokine and anti-cii igg secretions to lower levels and polarizing the treg th17 balance to treg more obviously this study highlights the potential therapeutic utility of itregs expanded by tdcs in autoimmune arthritis and should facilitate the future design of itreg tdc immunotherapeutic strategies against ra in may 2010 the world health assembly passed a resolution wha 6312 on the availability safety and quality of blood products this urges member states to take all necessary steps to establish implement and support nationally co-ordinated bts with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency the resolution applies to both fresh blood components and plasma derived medicinal products pdmps who defines self-sufficiency as meeting national needs for six products from blood and plasma collected locally these comprise red cells platelet concentrates fresh frozen plasma and factor viii immunoglobulin and albumin solution the definition and overall goals were established by a who expert consensus statement on achieving self-sufficiency based on vnrbd developed at a meeting of who experts in geneva switzerland in 2011 blood services develop in line with the health care system that they support typically this involves a transition from a supply for whole blood mainly in the context of emergency management of trauma and child birth to the implementation of blood component therapy blood component production will likely lead to an excess of recovered plasma effective utilisation of this requires access to plasma fractionation facilities if this can be achieved then this will reduce reliance on commercial pdmps and ensure maximal utilisation of the donated whole blood increasing demand for pdmps will potentially lead to a requirement for introduction of plasmapheresis programmes if the goal of self-sufficiency is to be maintained there are a number of significant barriers to both utilisation of recovered plasma and the implementation of effective plasmapheresis programmes individual countries will need to consider these as part of their long term strategic planning process the main barriers for low and medium hdi index countries are access to suitable plasma fractionation facilities few countries will be able to justify creation of a national fractionation plant regional co-operation and development of facilities will be needed secondly plasma for fractionation is seen as a critical material in the manufacture of a medicine quality system requirements including full compliance with a code of good manufacturing practice will be a pre-requisite for acceptance of the plasma as suitable for fractionation there is an urgent need to develop support programmes to raise standards to achieve this in contrast the main barrier for most high hdi countries is cost and the easy availability of pdmps produced by commercial countries from paid plasma the safety profile of pdmps is currently excellent since the integration of a number of specific viral inactivation steps in the manufacturing process overcomes any infectious burden associated with payment for plasma the critical question is then how a country can assure ongoing supply at a reasonable cost ethical principles will play an important role in defining the strategy and individual countries should be able to define their own approach without unnecessary intervention and competition from the commercial plasma industry 4a-s19-02 background blood transfusion service of nepal red cross society was established in the year 1966 since the beginning nrcs has been running the service exclusively with assurance of government of nepal in 1991 the government of nepal elaborated the mandate with clear policies and declared nepal red cross society as the sole authority to conduct the national blood program through out the country at present it consists of 86 centers in 62 districts national leadership and oversight of management and quality standards is the responsibility of the central blood transfusion service who in partnership with regional and district centers and aims to provide a safe and secure supply of bloodblood products to all needy in the country in the initial years the service was made possible through collection of blood from professional donors but since 1982 collection of blood was emphasized from voluntary non-remunerated donors only aims blood service is provided according to the need base and with the expansion of health services establishments of medical colleges government hospitals private hospitals and nursing homes the demand of blood is rapidly going up through out the country nationwide more than 250000 units of blood were served to the needy and around 60 of it is served through the central blood transfusion service results with the view of providing safe blood and bloodproducts to the needy patients all collected blood is routinely tested for hiv hbsag hcv syphilis besides grouping cross-matching and anti-d antibody identification blood components service is limited in few centers conclusion blood program is run through cost recovery basis with material and nominal service charge nationwide no defined budget is allocated for blood program there is on and off support provided from nepal government un agencies national societies and international non government organizations currently the total revenue raised for the blood program is insufficient to meet the total cost of production of blood and blood products 4a-s19-03 background blood transfusion services in cambodia face a number of significant challenges in providing a supply of safe blood and blood products sufficient to meet the clinical needs of patients these challenges include access to adequate and sustainable financing trained staff sufficient voluntary non-remunerated blood donors vnrbd and appropriate equipment and facilities aims a 2011 programme funded by the us presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar and managed by the us centres for disease control cdc was initiated by the cambodian based us cdc office in a collaborative partnership with the nbts and ministry of health moh specific blood program needs were identified and presented in a logical task order framework the task order required support at both the national and provincial level across the whole blood sector and priorities three key deliverables comprehensive assessment of the countrys current practices and infrastructure including national policy legislation collection testing and the clinical use of blood vnrbd recruitment strategiesprotocols a new 5 year national strategic blood plan methods the selected technical assistance partner ta developed a proposal that addressed the areas of the task order and utilised a number of strategies to deliver the technical program including a critical initial design phase with an introductory visit to map prior local and development partner work and draw on in-country seeking ongoing engagement and advocacy from local thought leaders tailoring assessment and strategy planning tools to local requirements use of inclusive communications with all stakeholders strengthening of local governance infrastructure blood safety working group  the 1 year program resulted in development and delivery of an assessment report on cambodias blood transfusion services a knowledge attitudes and practices survey and a five year national strategic blood plan nsp background indonesia has recognized that blood transfusion plays a key role in their modern health care yet ensuring the availability of safe blood is a challenge for a population of over 250 million living on 6000 islands with limited health care resources with a high background prevalence of hepatitis b virus hbv of 94 human immunodeficiency virus hiv of 02 and hepatitis c virus hcv 04 aim a health economic study was performed by the irc to evaluate the economic impact of individual donor id nat on the burden of disease hbv hcv hiv associated with transfusion transmitted infections ttis and understand the comprehensive costs to the ministry of health moh of providing id-nat-tested blood method a health economic analysis was performed using a markov method which predicts the probability of an outcome based on a chain of outcomes and defined transition probabilities the two arms of the analysis compared the testing costs and treatment costs of i serology alone and ii serology and nat testing costs were defined as the total costs to the indonesian moh of purchasing the reagents used in conducting either serological testing alone or serological and id-nat testing on donor blood units the treatment costs were defined by the outcomes associated with each of the three viruses hbv hiv hcv and the likelihood of various clinical outcomes for patients infected by transfusion indonesia-specific data drawn from peerreviewed published sources was used to populate the model in cases where published local data was not available proxy published data from other geographies and data collected from interviews with local transfusion experts were used cost information for id-nat and serology testing was sourced from test manufacturers results previous effectiveness of nat testingin annual collection of 21 million donations determined that id-nat could prevent 3187 infections missed by serology screening if id-nat assays were not available ttis represents a calculated usd 73 million in treatment costs for the indonesian healthcare system the introduction of id-nat could saveusd 27 million per year or20 savings due to reduced treatment costs by preventing ttis the estimated savings exclude costs associated with lost productivity and litigation conclusion sincethe initial analysis additional testing has been performed in variousdemographic locations and it is now estimated that 8500 whole blood units andup to 15000 blood components could be interdicted with id-nat these new datarepresent even more favorable economics to the moh while id-nat represents an additional cost tokeep blood as safe as possible the incremental cost comparison of serology andid-nat compared to serology testing alone shows a minimum estimated savings ofusd 27 million based on these results id-nat blood screening appears to be aclinically and cost-effective way to prevent transmission of infection to patients 4a-s20-01 yee-sin l tan tock seng hospital singapore singapore arbovirus is an acronym for a group of viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vectors commonly mosquitoes and ticks person-to-person transmission of arboviruses is not common however transmission can occur through transfusion of blood and blood products and organ transplantation if the virus is present in the donors blood or organ the majority of arboviral infections in humans are asymptomatic if symptomatic the symptoms generally occur 3-15 days after exposure clinical features of arboviral infections can be classified into four groups acute central nervous system illness acute benign fever with or without exanthem hemorrhagic fever and polyarthritis there have been published reports of transfusion-transmitted infections of a number of arboviruses including west nile and dengue viruses as well as colorado tick fever and tick-borne encephalitis viruses the risk of transmission depends largely on the burden of the disease in a particular geographical location the proportion of asymptomatic infections in which clinical diagnosis is not possible and the availability of diagnostics to detect low levels of viruses in the blood west nile virus wnv entered the united states us in 1999 and has spread across the entire north american continent wnv is now the most significant arboviral infection in the us one out of every five exposed individuals will develop illness and 1 out of 150 may suffer from severe infection with significant neurological sequelae in 2002 23 transfusion-transmitted wnv infections were described since 2003 all blood donations in the us have been routinely screened for wnv rna using wnv nucleic acid test nat since the implementation of screening 13 transfusion-associated transmissions of wnv have been documented mmwr 2012  dengue is the most common arboviral infection in the world the world health organisation who estimates that 50 million dengue infections occur annually and approximately 25 billion people live in dengue endemic countries who 2009  the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections vary widely singapore reported three cases of transfusion-associated dengue infections involving one blood donation episode an asymptomatic repeat blood donor informed the national blood bank that he had fever the day after blood donation by then packed red cells and other blood products from his donation had already been transfused to three recipients all three recipients were infected two of the recipients blood and the donors stored serum sample were tested positive for dengue serotype 2 virus by pcr wilder-smith et al estimated the risk for transfusion-associated dengue transmission in singapore to be 16-610000 blood transfusions in the year 2005 assuming a ration of asymptomatic-to-symptomatic infections of 21 to 101 subsequently teo et al reported the practice of deferring blood donation from recently returned travellers from dengue endemic areas the massive outbreaks of chikungunya fever in the indian ocean and southeast asia again raise concerns about blood safety although there has yet to be a reported case of transfusion-associated chikungunya virus infection such a transmission route remains a distinct possibility liumbruno gm et al reported an economic loss of approximately 2 million euros resulting from the suspension of blood donations at the peak of the chikungunya outbreak in italy in 2008 4a-s20-02 australian red cross blood service perth australia background arthropod-borne viruses arboviruses are an expanding global threat to human health among them dengue denv and west nile virus wnv have both been documented to be transfusion-transmissible and transfusion is a plausible route of infection for several others including chikungunya virus chikv and ross river virus rrv addressing the transfusion risk associated with arboviral outbreaks poses new challenges unlike established viral threats to the blood supply eg hiv hcv and hbv in which the risk is generalized to the population-at-large and chronic infection is common arboviruses are characterised by focal and often seasonal outbreaks of acute predominantly self-limiting infection thus unlike traditional viral threats the risk is not continuous in nature complicating risk mitigation strategies aims to describe possible risk management strategies for arboviral transmission including geographical donor deferralrestrictions on labile component manufacture donation testing and pathogen inactivation pi which can be applied individually or in combination methods how strategies are applied depends on the nature of the risk ie whether internal ie local outbreak or an external ie potentially viraemic donors returning from an outbreak affected country geographical donor deferral can take several forms ranging from deferral of donors returning from precisely defined outbreak risk areas eg wnv deferral for travel to n america to a blanket deferral of all donors returning for a defined period after return from overseas eg the netherlands while this can be an effective risk mitigation strategy it can lead to the deferral of significant numbers of donors and the impact on sufficiency needs careful consideration in some cases eg for local dengue outbreaks in australia this can be partially addressed by restricting manufacture to plasma for fractionation since pi within the fractionation process satisfactorily addresses the transmission risk triggering implementation of deferrals for specific outbreaks is problematic because a high proportion of arboviral infections are asymptomatic so asymptomatic donor viraemia poses a risk before the first symptomatic case is apparent instituting a deferral only during the transmission season is complicated because of the difficulty in precisely defining the beginning and end donors for major transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases ttids hiv hbv and hcv has evolved from performance of serologic assays only to include nucleic acid testing nat for detection of window phase and occult infections in most developed and some developing countries nat screening has also been implemented for other viruses known to be transmitted by blood components andor plasma derivatives parvovirus b19 hav and for several emergingexpanding infectious disease eid agents that threaten blood safety in some regions eg wnv in the us hev in japan and dengue virus in puerto rico despite this dramatic progress eid threats continue to be identified and cause pressure to further enhance the safety of transfusions the concept of a global village has emerged which reflects the fact that a potential blood-borne infectious agent present in any region of the world could traffic to other regions overnight there are increasing examples of zoonotic transmissions of infectious agents with the potential for rapid adaptation to humans and subsequent spread to blood donors and recipients there is also intense research to identify new blood born infectious agents using novel molecular discovery strategies although recent examples of putative new agents have proven to be non-pathogenic hgvgbvc ttv and sen-v not transmitted at significant rates by transfusions hhv-8 or contaminants xmrv every newly discovered agent requires serious investigation to assess its relevance to transfusion safety this presentation will highlight recent progress in developing approaches for systematic assessment of eid risks and for applying rational approaches to respond to new pathogens in an effort to proactively assess transfusion safety threats in the united states and canada the transfusion-transmitted diseases committee of the aabb has systematically reviewed relevant data and prioritized the risks of individual established and emerging disease agents this program includes aabb website accessible fact sheets for100 agents which are updated as new information becomes available or new agents of concern are identified recently a research program has been started using data of id-nat users for analyses of the efficacy of various testing strategies this allows comparison of the yield and risk reduction obtained by nat and serology assays in countries with differing incidence and prevalence rates of the three major viral infections furthermore the aabb eid sub-group and the european cdc have developed toolkits for assessing the risk of eids with respect to potential impact on blood safety and availability and for evaluating and validating the effectiveness of proposed interventions the toolkit process including methods to monitor eid agent emergence identify and recognize a transfusion-transmission threat processes to quantify risk and the appropriate management of such threats using formal decision analysis methodologies should be considered for implementation by all blood systems the main challenges for hospital transfusion are patient safety the effective use of blood robust methods for documentation and monitoring practice good blood stock management and low wastage good staff training and the rapid availability of blood for those patients who need it urgently patient safety is paramount but haemovigilance schemes worldwide continue to demonstrate that errors in the transfusion process result in patient morbidity and mortality this talk will indicate where progress has been made in improving transfusion safety in hospitals in the uk and use the implementation of an electronic transfusion management system in oxford as an example of improving patient safety the project involved the development of an end-to-end electronic transfusion process involving barcode patient identification handheld computers at the bedside and electronically controlled blood fridges linked to the blood transfusion laboratory information system it was taken through pilot stages between 2001 and 2006 through to its full implementation across the acute hospitals in oxfordshire in 200607 and its maintenance and further development since then there was an improvement from 118 to 100 of staff following the process for correct bedside patient identification no abo incompatible red cell transfusions or serious wrong blood events in over 10years a reduction in wrong blood in tube events reduced nursing one nurse rather than 2 and half the time to administer blood and laboratory workload and more rapid delivery of urgently required red cell units from a median of 18 min to 45 s the electronic system provided a simple mechanism for compliance with ukeu regulatory requirements for the traceability of blood and the documentation of transfusion and training feedback from both staff and patients was positive our group wrote a national specification and provided the material for a national recommendation for hospitals to adopt the electronic transfusion process but wider implementation by other hospitals has been slow an additional module into the electronic transfusion process is being implemented to provide decision support for doctors ordering blood to minimise inappropriate use of blood as part of a patient blood management programme there are considerable barriers to improving the safety of transfusion practice in hospitals but they can be overcome by re-engineering the process with the support of a multidisciplinary team with shared achievable and measurable objectives engaging with senior hospital management and having a determination to see the development of a new process through to completion and its implementation as routine practice whats new with trali in the last 20 years there have been substantial efforts to minimise or eliminate trali despite these activities in 2012 the fda still reported trali as the top cause of transfusion-associated mortality the pathophysiology of trali follows a two event mechanism the patients illness leads to activation of the pulmonary endothelium with the sequestration of primed neutrophilsthe first event the transfusion is the second event and leucocyte antibodies or biological responsive modifiers brms present in the blood product activate the microbicidal arsenal of the primed neutrophils to cause injury to the pulmonary microvasculature and consequently acute lung injury ali hence trali may be antibody-mediated or brm-mediated antibodies to human neutrophil antigens hna hla class i and class ii have been associated and implicated with trali interestingly a large prospective case-controlled study of over 400000 transfusions reported that recipients with cognate antigens to hna and hla class ii antibodies had increased risk of trali but found no statistical significance with hla class i toy et al 2012 blood  that hna-3a antibodies are associated with more severe trali indicates that antibody specificity is another determinant of trali injury reil et al 2008 vox sang  additionally murine models demonstrated that antibody titre also determined the severity of injury fung et al 2010 blood  while the use of male predominant plasma has significantly reduced the incidence of antibody-mediated cases trali still occurs likely due to brms brms are generated during the routine storage of blood products a meta-analysis of cardiac and trauma patients concluded that older blood is associated with a significant risk of death wang et al et al 2012 blood  given the success of male predominant plasma in managing the risk of antibody-mediated trali ongoing efforts to reduce the risk of trali are likely to focus on brm-mediated trali developing a better understanding of the how specific brms may contribute either individually or in combination to the development of trali and how brm concentrations vary between donors will be crucial to the future development of strategies to manage the risk of brm-mediated trali  terugblik op de influenzapandemie g van essen a   influenza griep is een acute luchtweginfectie veroorzaakt door een influenzavirus de infectie komt in nederland vooral in koude jaargetijden voor verreweg de meeste patinten herstellen binnen enkele weken maar de infectie kan gepaard gaan met ernstige complicaties en bij sommigen fataal verlopen de nhg-standaard influenza en influenzavaccinatie vermeldt een morbiditeit onder de algemene bevolking ten gevolge van een influenza-epidemie van 50 tot 200 personen per 1000 personen per jaar1 het aantal gevallen van een influenza-achtig ziektebeeld is de laatste decennia behoorlijk afgenomen van ruim 86 per 1000 in 19711972 naar 12 per 1000 in 20062007 de jaarlijkse mortaliteit wordt geschat op 250 tot 2000 de antigene variatie van het influenzavirus kan klein of groot zijn in het eerste geval spreekt men van antigene drift binnen n tot vijf jaar ontstaat er zo telkens een nieuwe virusvariant tijdens een infectie ontstaan er namelijk grote hoeveelheden viruspartikels met veel varianten de variant met veranderingen in het hemagglutinine en neuraminidase die het minste hinder ondervindt van bestaande antilichamen wordt verantwoordelijk voor de jaarlijkse epidemien maar het virus kan op nog veel drastischer wijze veranderen bij de antigene shift wordt een compleet gen dat codeert voor een oppervlakte-eiwit uitgewisseld voor een ander gen van een virus uit een niet-menselijk reservoir in de meeste gevallen betreft het dan een vogelgriep- of aviair virus een dergelijke antigene shift kan de aanleiding tot een pandemie vormen pandemien worden gekenmerkt door hoge morbiditeit bovenmatige mortaliteit en grote negatieve sociale en economische gevolgen2
 de 20e eeuw kende drie influenzapandemien3 in tabel 1 zijn enkele bijzonderheden van deze pandemien weergegeven de spaanse griep veroorzaakte vooral sterfgevallen onder jonge volwassenen sommige onderzoekers geven aan dat er voor dit merkwaardige fenomeen nooit een goede verklaring gevonden is terwijl anderen suggereren dat een cytokinestorm aan dit verschijnsel debet is geweest eenvoudig gezegd komt deze hypothese erop neer dat een op hol geslagen afweersysteem waarbij vooral wordt gedacht aan t-lymfocyten binnen korte tijd fatale schade toebrengt aan het lichaam en dat niet zozeer het virus zelf hiervoor verantwoordelijk is dit zou verklaren dat vooral jonge gezonde volwassenen met een optimaal functionerend afweersysteem zo snel en zo zwaar werden getroffen

 in 1997 werden in hongkong achttien volwassenen besmet met het vogelgriepvirus h5n1 van hen overleden er zes deze besmetting viel samen met een uitbraak van de vogelgriep binnen drie dagen slaagde hongkong er destijds in om de volledige kippenpopulatie te vernietigen circa 15 miljoen kippen experts zijn het erover eens dat deze actie mogelijk destijds een pandemie heeft voorkomen in februari 2003 waren er opnieuw twee humane besmettingsgevallen in hongkong waarvan er n fataal verliep medio 2003 brak in azi de vogelgriep uit onder diverse diersoorten niet alleen vogels en kippen werden getroffen door het h5n1-virus maar ook tijgers en luipaarden in een dierentuin in thailand nadat ze gevoed waren met verse kipkarkassen terwijl de vogelgriep zich steeds verder uitbreidde over azi en europa waarschijnlijk via trekvogels kwamen er vanaf januari 2004 steeds meer alarmerende berichten over menselijke slachtoffers van 2003 tot juni 2010 zijn er 500 besmettingen gedentificeerd 300 patinten 60 zijn overleden4
 vanwege deze zonotische besmetting ontstond eind jaren negentig van de vorige eeuw het idee dat de wereld zich zou moeten voorbereiden op een nieuwe pandemie de who riep de lidstaten op om pandemic planning te starten er werd een indeling in zes fasen gemaakt waarbij de verspreiding van het influenzavirus het criterium voor verhoging van de alarmfase dicteerde tabel 2 de dreiging van de vogelgriep met humane infecties van een aviair influenzavirus zonder mens-op-mensbesmetting was daarin fase 3

 ook de nederlandse overheid startte de voorbereiding op een mogelijke pandemie de gezondheidsraad bracht een aantal adviezen uit over antivirale middelen vaccinatie en andere preventieve maatregelen tabel 3 er werden draaiboeken ontwikkeld antivirale middelen aangekocht voor een derde van de bevolking de ontwikkeling van een nhg-standaard pandemie werd gestimuleerd en bedrijven kregen het advies zich voor te bereiden op continuteit van de ondernemingen bij grote uitval van personeel bij een pandemie

 het ministerie van vws richtte binnen het rivm het centrum voor infectieziektebestrijding cib op er kwamen afspraken voor het samenroepen van een outbreak management team omt met deskundigen uit de publieke gezondheidszorg microbiologen infectiologen en behandelaars afhankelijk van het soort dreiging kan de samenstelling van een dergelijk team wisselen maar alle contactgegevens van de deskundigen zijn bekend de eerste keer dat dit omt met spoed bijeenkwam was tijdens de sars-epidemie in 1997 in nederland viel die samen met de h7n7-infectie van kippen de kippenpest daarbij werden 87 mensen besmet en viel n dode te betreuren na ruiming van miljoenen kippen stopte de besmetting van de kippen in nederland ook bij de verspreiding van de q-koorts werd vaak het omt bijeengeroepen bij een pandemie is de minister van vws verantwoordelijk voor de bestrijding het omt van het rivm geeft vertrouwelijk advies aan het bestuurlijk afstemmingsoverleg bao dat de minister adviseert het advies van het bao is openbaar vervolgens beslist de minister over te nemen maatregelen toen bij de kippenpest bleek dat bij de ruimers de infectie met het influenza-a-virus h7n1 kon leiden tot conjunctivitis adviseerde het omt om oseltamivir profylactisch te geven aan de mensen die langer dan een bepaalde periode op een besmet bedrijf verbleven nadat dit advies gemplementeerd was ontstonden weinig nieuwe gevallen onder de ruimers vaccinproducenten bereidden de massale aanmaak van een pandemisch vaccin voor vanwege de lange productietijd van zes maanden en de registratievereisten voor een nieuw vaccin maakten zij op basis van het h5n1-virus een vaccin een dergelijk vaccin zou al vr een epidemie gegeven kunnen worden om het immuunsysteem te primen bij het vaststellen van het definitieve pandemische virus zou dan slechts een tweede iets gewijzigd vaccin nodig zijn om het voorbereide systeem te boosteren de registratie zou dan snel kunnen verlopen zodat daarmee geen tijd verloren zou gaan de gezondheidsraad bereidde begin 2009 een advies daartoe voor in maart 2009 kwam de eerste melding van een nieuw influenza-a-virus h1n1 uit californi dit virus leek op een influenzavirus dat bij varkens voorkwam min of meer gelijktijdig kwamen er berichten uit mexico over een forse toename van pneumonien onder jonge mensen eind april bleek dat het californische virus ook de oorzaak was van die mexicaanse uitbraak na typering van het virus bleken er elementen van humane aviaire en varkensinfluenza in voor te komen op 24 april kwam de eerste pandemiewaarschuwing van de who het virus zou later genoemd worden naar de eerste vindplaats influenza acalifornia72009 h1n1v maar de termen mexicaanse griep swine flu en nieuwe influenza h1n1 bleven internationaal in omloop in dit stuk is gekozen voor de term mexicaanse griep de ontwikkelingen in nederland zijn weergegeven in tabel 4 na de eerste melding door de who werd op 27 april fase 4 afgekondigd vanwege het bestaan van kleine clusters van mens-op-mensbesmettingen het rivm riep op 29 april het omt bijeen diezelfde dag werd de pandemie door de who opgeschaald naar fase 5 omdat de clusters groter bleken dan eerder voorzien het omt adviseerde om de mexicaanse griep meldingsplichtig te maken en om maatregelen te nemen om verspreiding in nederland te beperken iedere mogelijke besmetting moest door een test aangetoond worden de patint en diens gezinsleden werden behandeld met oseltamivir en mochten een week lang niet buiten komen vooral de ggd in amsterdam werd overstelpt met reizigers die in een vliegtuig in de buurt van een mogelijke patint hadden gereisd

 op 30 april 2009 werd het eerste geval van mexicaanse griep in nederland aangetoond de commissie van de gezondheidsraad die een advies over eventuele prepandemische vaccinatie had voorbereid kwam op 8 mei bijeen en adviseerde de minister om vaccin voor de gehele bevolking te kopen in het gezondheidsraadadvies van 2000 over pandemische vaccinatie was dit plan al voorbereid uit proeven met het prepandemische h5n1-vaccin was gebleken dat minstens twee vaccinaties nodig zouden zijn en dat deze liefst ook een hulpstof zouden bevatten omdat niemand in de bevolking eerder met een nieuw pandemisch virus in aanraking zou zijn gekomen was een geadjuveerd vaccin tweemaal gegeven de beste garantie op een beschermende titer in mexico en ook in de verenigde staten breidde de griep zich uit beelden van overvolle ziekenhuizen en het stilleggen van alle activiteiten in mexico-stad domineerden het nieuws eind mei verschenen de eerste epidemiologische gegevens uit mexico waarbij de meest opvallende bevinding was dat vooral jongvolwassenen risico op complicaties en zelfs sterfte liepen5 de sterftecurve had een w-vorm met een piek op midvolwassen leeftijd naast de pieken bij kinderen en ouderen net als tijdens de spaanse griep in 1918 de traditionele u-curve van ziekenhuisopnames en sterfte tijdens een gewone griepepidemie waarbij vooral kinderen en ouderen slachtoffers waren werd nu niet aangetroffen op basis van de toen beschikbare gegevens kondigde de who op 11 juni fase 6 af dat betekende dat het virus wereldwijd verspreid was de fasering had geen betrekking op de ernst van de ziekte langzamerhand bleek dat de mexicaanse griep mild was ouderen vooral geboren vr 1957 leken relatief beschermd wellicht door eerder verworven immuniteit tegen dit h1n1-virus de meeste risicogroepen voor complicaties van een griepvirus betreffen juist oudere mensen de sterftecijfers vielen daardoor mee maar sterfte onder kinderen en jongvolwassenen had grote impact in de publiciteit in nederland was het aantal gevallen nog steeds beperkt er waren enkele uitbraken na bezoek aan evenementen maar de virologische laboratoria de ziekenhuizen en de ggds konden de belasting nog aan de eerste dode in nederland viel op 4 augustus inmiddels had de minister op 19 juni 34 miljoen vaccins besteld ook andere europese landen zoals het verenigd koninkrijk frankrijk en duitsland bestelden vaccin voor de gehele bevolking maar landen waaronder belgi deden dat voor n enkele vaccinatie of bestelden niets vanwege gevreesde bijwerkingen of gebrek aan vertrouwen in de werking van het vaccin dan wel uit financile motieven de zeggenschap over de gezondheidszorg berust in de europese unie bij de lidstaten het europese centre of disease control ecdc had in het verleden wel toegezien op de pandemische voorbereiding in de lidstaten maar speelde in de advisering over vaccinatie en behandeling met antivirale middelen geen enkele rol het gevolg was dat er in europa 27 verschillende protocollen voor de bestrijding van de pandemie bestonden het unieke aan deze pandemie was dat nooit eerder een pandemisch virus zo snel gedetecteerd en getypeerd was ook de verspreiding van epidemiologische gegevens ging snel en het beleid kon op basis van deze evidence voortdurend worden bijgesteld via elektronische media kon de implementatie van dat beleid ook snel plaatsvinden de voorlichting aan de bevolking en ook aan de gezondheidszorgmedewerkers kon dit maar net bijhouden waardoor soms de indruk van een zwalkend beleid ontstond zo was het oorspronkelijke advies om iedere patint met griep tijdens de pandemie met een antiviraal middel te behandelen dit advies lag ten grondslag aan de opslag van vijf miljoen kuren oseltamivir en in kleinere aantallen zanamivir bij een geschatte ziektelast van een derde van de bevolking zou dan voldoende medicijn beschikbaar zijn de bedoeling was vooral om daarmee de top van de epidemie af te vlakken waardoor complicaties minder zouden voorkomen en over een grotere tijdspanne zouden worden gespreid daarmee zou de beschikbare ziekenhuiscapaciteit langer voldoende zijn aangezien bleek dat de pandemie tot milde ziekteverschijnselen leidde leek behandeling van iedere patint met griep met oseltamivir niet meer aan de orde de bijwerkingen van het middel zouden bij een dergelijk uitgebreide toepassing wellicht erger zijn dan de kwaal de sterfgevallen bleken vooral bij patinten uit de bekende risicogroepen te liggen bij kinderen onder de 2 jaar en bij zwangeren in het derde trimester bij die laatste groep leek de beperkte bewegingsmogelijkheid van het diafragma een belangrijke oorzaak want ook bij mensen met fors overgewicht werd meer sterfte gevonden het rivm bracht samen met de gezondheidsraad een advies uit om deze groepen met oseltamivir te behandelen mits mogelijk binnen 48 uur na de start van de ziekte6
 inmiddels nam het aantal gevallen fors toe in nederland kwamen de besmettingen niet meer alleen uit mexico en de vs maar vooral uit andere europese vakantielanden als het verenigd koninkrijk en spanje de meldingsplicht en de isolatie van patinten leken niet meer doeltreffend op
15 augustus werd de meldingsplicht beperkt tot ziekenhuisopname en sterfte door het h1n1-virus behandeling van patinten met antivirale middelen werd beperkt tot de genoemde risicogroepen en profylactische toediening van oseltamivir aan familieleden werd gestaakt de reguliere gezondheidszorg en vooral de huisartsen moesten de pandemie gaan bestrijden in september was het vaccin nog niet beschikbaar en gezondheidszorgpersoneel liep dus grote kans op besmetting voorzorgsmaatregelen als mondkapjes en handalcohol werden geadviseerd de adviezen van vr die tijd met bijvoorbeeld disposable schorten werden teruggedraaid wel bleef het advies om patinten thuis te bezoeken om zo besmetting op de praktijk te voorkomen vooral op huisartsenposten bleek dit advies moeilijk te implementeren en leidde het tot veel telefoontjes en gescheiden patintenstromen de dreiging van het instorten van de gezondheidszorg door overbelasting met patinten of massale uitval van personeel bestond nog steeds de ghor de geneeskundige hulpverlening bij ongevallen en rampen maakte plannen om de gezondheidszorg zo veel mogelijk intact te houden regionale verschillen in uitvoering van de plannen maakten het voor de huisarts weinig overzichtelijk er kwamen plannen voor zorgmeldpunten die ingericht zouden worden bij uitval van huisartsenpraktijken deze zouden gevestigd worden in hotels en kazernes en zij zouden bemand moeten worden door dezelfde huisartsen die nu net uitgevallen waren plannen om huisartsenposten ook overdag open te stellen waren wellicht reler de vaccins waren besteld maar de levering zou nog even duren bovendien was de afspraak met de producent dat per maand een bepaald percentage van de bestelde hoeveelheid zou worden afgeleverd landen die weinig bestelden bijvoorbeeld alleen voor de risicogroepen kregen slechts een gedeelte tijdig geleverd aangezien nederland voor de totale bevolking had besteld kwamen voldoende vaccins voor de risicogroepen in november binnen op 17 augustus adviseerde de gezondheidsraad om de bekende risicogroepen te vaccineren aangevuld met werkers in de gezondheidszorg met directe patintencontacten en zwangeren7 gezinsleden van patinten met een hoog risico kwamen ook in aanmerking voor de vaccinatie de huisartsen hadden het seizoensvaccin al in huis en er was genoeg tijd om ook dat toe te dienen nog steeds was het onduidelijk of de gewone griep met influenza a h3n2 niet ook nog zou gaan circuleren gevolg was dat de risicogroepen drie vaccinaties moesten krijgen eenmaal voor de seizoensgriep en twee keer voor de mexicaanse griep de omvang van de risicogroep voor de mexicaanse griep was groter vanwege de toevoeging van de zwangeren de huisgenoten van hoogrisicopatinten en het personeel van de huisartsenpraktijk zelf nadat de vaccinatie van de bekende risicogroepen was afgesproken ontstond angst voor verdere verspreiding onder kinderen veel kinderen werden vaak uit voorzorg opgenomen maar sommige belandden op de kinder-ic tijdens de jaarwisseling wanneer vaak het rs-virus en het influenzavirus elkaar afwisselen is de bezetting van kinder-ics normaliter al hoog teneinde te voorkomen dat de kinderafdelingen zouden worden overspoeld met kinderen met influenza werd op 17 november besloten om alle kinderen ouder dan 6 maanden en jonger dan 5 jaar te vaccineren de gezinsgenoten van kinderen onder de 6 maanden  voor die jonge leeftijd is het vaccin niet geregistreerd  kregen ook het advies tot vaccinatie om zo besmetting van die kwetsbare babys te voorkomen twee weken later startten de ggds met het vaccineren van meer dan een miljoen kinderen al deze berichten leidden tot een grote informatiebehoefte bij het publiek en de gezondheidszorgmedewerkers het ministerie cordineerde de voorlichting aan het publiek met een huis-aan-huisfolder televisiespotjes en een speciale website het rivm verzorgde de voorlichting aan professionals dit gebeurde wat betreft de voorlichting aan huisartsen in nauw overleg met de lhv en het nhg beide beroepsorganisaties richtten een website over de mexicaanse griep in en zorgden ervoor dat alle informatie afgestemd bleef met die van vws en het rivm en voor de vaccinatie met het nationaal programma grieppreventie8 in tabel 5 staat als voorbeeld een opsomming van de activiteiten van het nhg zoals vermeld in het jaarverslag

 alle voorlichting werd voortdurend onderzocht op consistentie vooral over het geadjuveerde vaccin kwam veel informatie op het web terecht op websites van bijvoorbeeld kritischprikkennl in een vragenlijstonderzoek bleek dat de informatie van het rivm en vws door 56 van de bevolking werd gewaardeerd9 de informatie van de ggd werd door 62 van de ondervraagden betrouwbaar geacht ruim 70 beoordeelde de informatie van de huisarts als het betrouwbaarst de vaccinatiegraad was ondanks al deze wisselende publiciteit niet anders dan tegen de seizoensgriep van de risicopopulatie kreeg 70 de seizoensprik 72 minstens n vaccinatie tegen de mexicaanse griep en 64 zelfs beide vaccinaties10 de vaccinatiegraad van de huisarts en het praktijkpersoneel zelf lag op gelijke hoogte11 de huisartsenpraktijken gaven in de periode oktober-november in totaal 12 miljoen vaccinaties de ggds haalden in de eerste ronde 69 van de opgeroepen kinderen en in de tweede ronde 58 de percentages liggen aanzienlijk hoger dan in andere landen zo werd in frankrijk nog geen 10 gevaccineerd daar werd de huisarts gepasseerd bij de vaccinatie en dat bleek geen goede zet de omvang van de mexicaanse griep bleek uiteindelijk na of juist door de vaccinatie mee te vallen zie figuur 1 het aantal gevallen zoals bijgehouden door de peilstations van het nivel kwam niet boven de normale seizoensgriep uit doordat bij ouderen de ziekte weinig voor kwam bleef de sterfte ver achter bij de normale jaarlijkse mortaliteit door influenza in totaal werden 2196 mensen opgenomen in een ziekenhuis en stierven 63 patinten aan de gevolgen van de mexicaanse griep

 de discrepantie tussen de uitgebreide voorbereiding en de uiteindelijke omvang van de pandemie heeft wereldwijd geleid tot behoefte aan evaluatie de who de raad van europa het europees parlement en vele ministeries van gezondheidszorg startten onderzoek naar het effect van alle maatregelen in nederland zal het ministerie van vws voor eind 2010 daarover een rapport uitbrengen een belangrijk aspect is de rol die de farmaceutische industrie zou hebben gespeeld bij het opblazen van de pandemie de adviseurs van de who liggen onder vuur vanwege vermeende financile belangen het lijkt te vroeg om nu al conclusies te trekken de effectiviteit van preventieve zorg is altijd moeilijk te meten het resultaat van preventie is een non-event als het goed wordt uitgevoerd gebeurt er niets de opvatting dat door de optimale voorbereiding en uitvoering van alle activiteiten de omvang van de pandemie is meegevallen is niet populair duidelijk is al wel dat europese afstemming node gemist is op het terrein van voorbereiding vaccinatie en antivirale behandeling waren er geen twee protocollen gelijk als alleen al dat zou verbeteren is de evaluatie niet voor niets geweest  stoppen-met-rokenzorg fien huige esther croes

immunity threshold and lockdown effects using a covid-19 specific model shaurya kaushal abhineet rajput singh soumyadeep bhattacharya m vidyasagar aloke kumar meher prakash k santosh ansumali  a quantitative covid-19 model that incorporates hidden asymptomatic patients is developed and an analytic solution in parametric form is given the model incorporates the impact of lockdown and resulting spatial migration of population due to announcement of lockdown a method is presented for estimating the model parameters from real-world data it is shown that increase of infections slows down and herd immunity is achieved when symptomatic patients are 4-6 of the population for the european countries we studied when the total infected fraction is between 50-56  finally a method for estimating the number of asymptomatic patients who have been the key hidden link in the spread of the infections is presented  covid-19 infections have breached the five million mark yet there is neither a vaccine nor a scalable treatment in sight 1 2  furthermore a distinctive feature of the covid-19 in contrast to other infectious diseases such as influenza or sars is the presence of a large fraction of asymptomatic patients who dont have any obvious symptoms but are still capable of infecting susceptible individuals through contacts however identifying individuals spreading infections via the asymptomatic pathway is not easy unless extensive contact tracing and testing are performed a major challenge is the uncertainty in the estimation of asymptomatic fraction with estimates ranging from 41 to 86 of infected 3 4  and along the symptomatic pathway 44 of the infections are spread before the onset of symptoms rendering the quarantining people with symptoms less efficient compared to other infectious diseases 5 these challenges have driven governments to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions npis such as social distancing and partial or full lockdowns 6  an unsaid a posteriori rationale for these lockdowns is that they provide efficient isolation mechanism for asymptomatic however a dearth of quantitative understanding of the effects of the lockdown has triggered debate around the effectiveness duration and mode partial vs full of lockdown thus it is even suggested that societies should just move in an unhindered manner towards the attainment of the herd-immunity threshold 7  this threshold is achieved when a sufficiently large proportion of a population becomes immune and as a result the disease spread slows down for covid-19 estimating the onset of herd immunity remains elusive and indeed ascertaining whether herd immunity exists at all moreover high case fatality rate of 3  10 vs 005 for seasonal influenza limits the practicality of herd immunity as an effective policy tool thus models that can provide quantitative estimates of the disease spread and the impact of policy measures are expeditiously required similar to other epidemicspandemic three different kinds of models are used for covid-19 1 statistical extrapolation models which fit the observed patterns of infections to make short-term prediction 8 9  2 agent based models for a qualitative illustration of microscopic dynamics of spreading infections 10  and 3 compartment models which divide the population into groups based on the current different disease state of the individual and model the interaction among them 2 11 12 13  since 1927 plague in mumbai compartmental models have been a standard guiding tool for policy decisions 14  the spread of flu-like diseases influenza sars covid-19 etc is often modelled using three or four compartments susceptible-infected-recovered sir or susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered seir some variants also consider theoretically a simple containment option of quarantining infected persons with symptoms however all these models assume that only contact between the s and the i compartments leads to new infections with the implicit assumption that contact between the s and e compartments does not lead to any infection in contrast an asymptomatic patient with covid-19 can and does infect susceptible individuals through contact thus epidemiological models must consider the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic moreover models should distinguish between lockdown and quarantine as these are two qualitatively different policy tools the former operating at the level of a society and the latter the level of a few individuals in this letter we aim to model all these novel aspects of covid-19 and to accomplish three goals corporating above mentioned unique aspects of covid-19 disease spread and associated policies the observed epidemiological data and sheds light on the underlying parameters and universalities that govern the dynamics in the different phases of the pandemic spread and containment 3 use the model to address pertinent questions beyond what is readily measurable -estimates of the hidden asymptomatics or at what fraction of symptomatic infections herd immunity would be achieved we accomplish these objectives by introducing the sair model which treats infections by an asymptomatic a or an infected symptomatic person i as being equally likely the dynamical behavior of this model is quite different from that of the seir model the model takes into account lockdown in an explicit fashion by using discontinuous in time reproduction rate the effective rate at which susceptible population get converted into infected we give an implicit closed-form solution for this sair model which sheds light on the dynamics of the sair model and also leads to methods for estimating the parameters therein in order to make this parametric form readily computable we also introduce an approximate explicit representation then we provide a method for estimating the parameters in the model based on the evolution of the disease and extract the underlying country-specific parameters from the infection data further we show that there exists an intermediate regime immediately after the lockdown that is country-specific and that the country specific metrics of the success of lockdown can be extracted and analyzed then we show that the herd immunity for covid-19 is achieved when the total symptomatic infections are only around 510 of the population which is lower than estimated we begin by emphasizing the difference between seir and sair models 11  a typical seir model assumes a framework of serial directed transitions across the intermediate health states of the individuals fig1  in this framework the infections are caused when a susceptible person comes in contact with a person deemed to be infected person on the basis of the symptoms i however after this contact with a certain likelihood the person remains in a pre-symptomatic intermediate state or the exposed individual e that is not contagious before transitioning to a contagious and symptomic state i while this framework is acceptable for influenza or sars the epidemiology of covid-19 is such that there is an alternative pathway between the susceptible s and the recovered states r which passes through asymptomatic individuals estimated to be around 86 3 who never show any symptoms but carry enough viral load to infect others thus a model for covid-19 should consider two parallel pathways of infection  figure 1b  we consider a generalized version of sair model as representation of a homogenously mixed population segment where covid-19 is spreading the system will obey the following sair dynamic where for any variable x time derivative is denoted a x  dxdt we assume that t denotes the probability with which when a susceptible person meets an infected or asymptomatic person they become a part of the asymptomatics which for simplicity includes the pre-symptomatics and the asymptomatics in our formulation of the model we claim that the lockdown can be modeled by considering a sudden change in the infection rate constant using a heavyside function as t   0 ht lock  t here we note in passing that one can model social distancing as reduction in value of  or an imperfect lockdown in a minimal model one may assume that asymptomatic patients either get converted into symptomatic one with an effective rate  or recovers with a rate  this term typically absent in standard models denotes the fact that in an idealized lock-down no susceptible person meets an infected person and thus first order reaction changes to a zero-order reaction before we proceed to analyse the model we wish to point out that one may add further complication to this model by introducing more parameters and compartments for example recovery rate  and infection rate  need not be same for asymptomatic and symptomatic fraction 11  however as there is no biological evidence to the contrary we assume that both rates are equal which leads to an analytically tractable and simplified framework however in reality for a large country it is unrealistic to consider it as a homogenously mixed population further during this crisis we learnt that once a lockdown is announced people migrate across different segments of a country even for a qualitatively correct modeling of disease spread dynamics it is important to account for this migration of people this migration can indeed happen in many waves however for simplicity we assume that it happens once and only during a short duration after lockdown furthermore one would expect that among infected population only asymptomatic people are able to travel here it needs to be reminded that we are only interested in the influx of the infected population in a given population segment and not the details of where they came from in order to model such a scenario we take typical thermodynamic route of dividing the system into two parts system and universe finally the cou- and is the short period of time post lock-down in which population migration is allowedpossible this migration is a characteristic of the system country or region under consideration and parameters  and need to be extracted from the data the rest of the world can also be assumed for this purpose to be following a similar sair dynamic eq1 and 2 complete our development of covid-19 specific model in the present work we solved a phenomenological model of a well-mixed society with everyone interacting with everyone else however the interactions may be structured by age local movement of the population and many of these can be modelled in the framework of agent based models the formulation of the disease specific interactions we developed can also be integrated into other models which study the interactions at agent level detail or in tandem with economic consequences 15  both of which are beyond the scope of the present work with an emphasis mainly on the spread of infections at the societal level we show that the set of equations we model are sufficient to capture most of the available epidemiological data on covid-19 this system of equations can be solved for prelockdown situation in terms of the reproduction rate r 0   0  by defining m  i  a and observing that before lockdown we have which can be solved in terms ofs  ss 0 as where m  s  r  1 at any instant s 0 denotes the susceptible population at t  0 and the recovered population at t  0 is taken to be 0 on the other hand after an idealized lock-down no susceptible person meets an infected person and thus the first order reaction changes to a zero order reaction the intermediate time t lock  t  t lock   solution simplifies to once there is no more flux of asymptomatic individuals the equations for m yield an exponential decay given by 6 substituting the expression from eq4 in the evolution equation for s gives us the parametric solution in implicit form as assuming that the equation can be converted to an explicit form fors as a function of t it is possible to substitute this into eq4 to obtain an expression for m as a function of t finally the expression for m t can be disambiguated into separate expressions for it and at by using eq1 specifically in the equation for we can substitute a  m  i which give if we define a new constant  1     then the solution of the above equation is therefore the key is to turn eq 7 into an explicit expression to the extent possible for this purpose we use hermite-hadamard inequality for the logarithm 16 z which suggests that we use approximate form of the logarithm as log z  z  1w 1 z  w 2  with the constraint that w 1  w 2  1 upon approximating the logarithm we get a solution in explicit form as where a  s 0 r 0  w 2 r 0  b  r 0  w 1  w 2  r 0  d  w 1 r 0  where h 2  2 a  b  h2 a  b  h and h is a constant such that and h   b 2  4ad once the evolution equation for s is known in a closed from we find the evolution for the remaining variables using eq 4 table 1 the evolution of infections pre-lockdown and in early time limit is given by where k  r 0  1 and g  s 0 r 0  1 the solution post lock-down is given by where eqs 11  eq 6 be managed at most with contact tracing and quarantine and hence addressing a solution for the lockdown did not arise covid-19 thus presented itself with the unique infection scenarios and the challenges of the lockdown for its mitigation and our model and its closed form-solution address these uniquene aspects the reported infection data from different countries had three regimes -rising intermediate and decreasing if they implemented a lockdown it can be easily assumed that the reported infections are the symptomatic infections since most countries have been short of testing resources as a result patients were tested for a confirmation only after the onset of symptoms the equations derived above for i could be fit will all these three different regimes in the process we could extract the governing parameters the parameter  0   and  1 are estimated by fitting eq 11 eq6 and eq12 respectively to the publicly available data pertaining to the pre and post lock-down period for various countries see supplemental material 17  the parameters  0 representing the rise is similar for many countries reiterating a universal pattern in the initial pre-lockdown regime this can be understood as an intrinsic characteristic dynamics of covid-19 which exhibits strong similarities across countries see table 1 in supplemental material 17  but a much stronger country-specific disease dynamics was the intermediate regime described using the parameter  1  the formal solution in eq 12 is fit to the infection rate right after lock-down to estimate the parameter  1 and  see supplementary figs34  this is to be expected as migration during lockdown can be expected to be a country-specific event dictated by the prevalent social-political conditions  the blue and the red lines indicate the maxima considering only the symptomatic or the total infections respectively the infection rate slows down significantly and a herd-immunity is achieved after the combined infections reach a peak when the symptomatic infections have crossed  57 of the total population the peak of the symptomatic infections is achieved at around 16 just before the final saturation value of around 20 with these validations for the levels of infections i that were observed in the different countries and the parameters that were extracted we could estimate how the number of individuals in the individual compartments s a i and r changed with time with or without a lockdown fig3  because it had been impossible to test the entire population or even a significant fraction of it the asymptomatics have remained a missing link in the epidemiology although certain estimates suggest a 110 ratio between the sympomatic and asymptomatic individuals using our model we could estimate the ratio of the asymptomatic to symptomatic individuals supplementary fig 5  which varies from 1 to 40 depending on the phase of the pandemic dynamics our results show that the herd-immunity defined as the fraction of population at which symptomatic infections reach a peak and beyond which begin decreasing could be achieved at 4-6 of the population as illustrated in fig3 ta-ble 2 in supplementary informationthese estimates for herd-immunity which are in single digit percentages only seem contradictory to estimates of 50-60 18 until one realises the large fraction of the infections are asymptomatic accounting for a total infection of 50-56 of the population supplementary table 2  thus our model allowed us to make estimates both for the hiddenasymptomatics and the herd-immunity and the fraction of the symptomatics who will burden the health care system in conclusion as a part of our analysis we are able to provide a method for estimating the asymptomatic fraction of the population finally by fitting our model to data from countries where the pandemic appears to have peaked we are also able to estimate the level of herd-immunity we are able to show that herd-immunity is achieved at levels of just 5 to 10 far lower than the levels suggested in the literature we find that the sair model can be readily adapted to incorporate the effects of lockdown and the solution to the system of equations bears striking resemblance to the real-world data the formal solution allows one to evaluate the effect of lockdown as a policy tool and can also be integrated into other frameworks which study the economic consequences of the lockdowns which can be simply written in the form the solution upon integrating is where the integration variable is s as b 2  4ad the equation can be rewritten as using the identity i arctanix  arctanhx using the identity arctanhx  1 2 log x1 thus using approximation 2 gives us an analytically tractable solution for the susceptible population in this section we discuss the estimation procedure for the parameters  0    the analytical solutions for the infectedactive and recovered populations is known for both prediscussed in section i and post lock-down scenarios these analytical solutions are then fit onto the real time data for several countries to give us an estimate of the parameters relevant to covid19 we begin with the post lock-down scenarios as the solutions are rather straight forward after a   number of days post lockdown the recovery rate is given b 14 and the infection is given by using eq 14  where k  r 0  1 and g  s 0 r 0  1 the solution post lock-down is given by l exp 1   1 1  ht  t 18 where      in hoeverre hebben we geleerd van de lessen uit de vorige crisis van 2008 zijn de vette jaren alleen gebruikt om geld opzij te leggen voor slechte tijden of is die tijd ook gebruikt om systeemfouten aan te pakken parallellen en verschillen tussen de crisis van 2008 en nu worden de rijken rijker en de armen armer o nlangs was the big short weer eens op televisie de film over de weg naar de financile crisis van 2008 schetst een ontluisterend beeld van de financile sector in de vs en het rotsvaste vertrouwen dat het nooit fout zou kunnen gaan met het stijgen van de huizenprijzen en de groeiende rendementen op kapitaal uiteindelijk leidde de crisis in de financile sector tot een wereldwijde economische crisis en daarmee gepaard gaande massawerkloosheid het terugzien van the big short en alle herinneringen aan de economische crisis die daarop volgden riepen de vraag op welke parallellen we kunnen trekken tussen toen en nu in hoeverre mogen we verwachten dat we geleerd hebben van de lessen uit de vorige crisis die zich nog zo kortgeleden voltrok die vraag dringt zich des te meer op omdat in nederland net als in duitsland nog dezelfde regeringsleider aan het roer staat als destijds er zou sprake moeten zijn van enig geheugen omdat groeiende werkloosheid en daarmee inkomensdalingen bij huishoudens zich nu al aankondigen is de vraag of de vette jaren niet alleen gebruikt zijn om geld opzij te leggen voor slechte tijden maar ook of die tijd is gebruikt om systeemfouten aan te pakken ik wil hier met name kijken naar de mate waarin het systeem verbeterd is in het bieden van een minimaal noodzake-lijke bestaans-en inkomenszekerheid en of daar waar dat niet of te laat gebeurt het systeem voldoende is voorbereid op het voorkomen en helpen oplossen van grote schulden bij huishoudens ik beperk me hier even tot mensen in loondienst en zzpers vragen over bestaanszekerheid en ondersteunen van het mkb 1 zijn niet minder relevant maar ik heb hier niet de ruimte om ook op die groepen in te gaan wellicht een volgende keer de regering doet veel om bedrijven te stimuleren personeel in dienst te houden met name de zogenaamde now noodmaatregel overbrugging voor werkgelegenheid 2 die is ingericht om de loonkosten van bedrijven tot 90 procent over nemen is hierop gericht 3 het is een maatregel die vooral helpt te voorkomen dat bedrijven direct omvallen en daarmee dat de werk-en bestaanszekerheid van hun werknemers wegvalt dat dit op korte termijn helpt leert een snelle vergelijking tussen nederland en de vs is de toename van het aantal ww-aanvragen in nederland nog beperkt tot enkele tienduizenden in de vs zijn in een kleine twee maanden ruim 36 miljoen aanvragen voor werkloosheidsuitkeringen geregistreerd of in percentage van de beroepsbevolking 05 versus ruim 20 procent de maatregel is na de eerste drie maanden recentelijk verlengd om massawerkloosheid en inkomensterugval op ongekende schaal te voorkomen daarbij moet aangetekend worden dat het ontslagverbod voor bedrijven die een beroep doen op de now is komen te vervallen de nabije toekomst zal leren welke effecten dat heeft op de werkloosheidsontwikkeling en daarmee op de bestaanszekerheid van veel huishoudens ook bedrijven die slechts gedeeltelijk kunnen herstarten zoals in de horeca en het toerisme zullen gecompenseerd moeten blijven worden opdat ze niet omvallen alternatief is dat deze bedrijven een faillissement aanvragen de maatschappelijke kosten daarvan zullen nog hoger zijn de tweede noodmaatregel is de tozo tijdelijke overbruggingsregeling zelfstandig ondernemers deze regeling moet een vangnet bieden aan zelfstandig ondernemers onder wie zzpers wanneer zij aannemelijk kunnen maken dat zij met hun inkomen uit onderneming als gevolg van de coronacrisis onder het sociaal minimum terecht zijn gekomen kunnen zij via de gemeente een inkomensaanvulling ontvangen tot aan dat sociaal minimum de vermogens-en partnertoetsen die normaal gelden wanneer mensen een beroep doen op het besluit bijstandsverlening zelfstandigen bbz zijn tot 1 juni niet van toepassing in de tweede tozo-periode zijn de regels inmiddels-inkomen sociaalbestek juni 2020 5 aangepast de partnertoets wordt van toepassing doel is om de grote groep zzpers die werkzaam zijn in onder andere de cultuursector de evenementenbranche de horeca de fitness-en sportsector en -op iets langere termijn -de bouw en de land-en tuinbouw 4 niet door het financile ijs te laten zakken of dit bij de nieuwe voorwaarden nog gaat gebeuren moet overigens betwijfeld worden de kernvraag is hier of huishoudens met een vast inkomen en een weggevallen zzp-inkomen de vaste lasten nog wel kunnen betalen zo niet dan dreigen betalingsachterstanden op vrij forse schaal voor deze groep deze maatregelen zullen in sommige sectoren net zo lang gecontinueerd moeten worden totdat de beperkingen op contact in het kader van de anderhalvemetersamenleving grotendeels zijn opgeheven veel van de genoemde sectoren kunnen niet rendabel opereren met 20 tot 50 procent van de klanten de enige sector die ik tot nu toe voorbij heb zien komen die suggereert dat het wellicht mogelijk is is die van de fitnessbedrijven en juist die moet vooralsnog dicht blijven tot 1 september naast directe inkomensmaatregelen is ook een aantal indirectere maatregelen getroffen zo is al vrij snel steun toegezegd aan de voedselbanken die last hadden van het -kortdurendehamsteren door die groepen die zich dat konden permitteren daarnaast kregen voedselbanken al heel kort na het afkondigen van de intelligente lockdown te maken met een snel groeiende vraag met hulp van de overheid en aanvullende financiering van een aantal fondsen konden zij deze vraag voorals-nog opvangen in hoeverre dat op de korte en de lange termijn voldoende zal zijn is nog niet duidelijk vanuit maatschappelijke fondsen vermogensfondsen en de sociale basis wordt verder veel gedaan om kwetsbare huishoudens te ondersteunen met bijvoorbeeld maaltijden die zij in de oude situatie tegen een zeer beperkte vergoeding in buurthuizen en dergelijke konden eten of afhalen ten slotte is in sneltreinvaart voorzien in additionele dag-en nachtopvang voor dak-en thuislozen om te voorkomen dat deze groep gedwongen in de openbare ruimte moet verblijven ten aanzien van deze maatregelen mogen we wellicht rijk-arm voor de een is het park een plek om te recreren de ander vindt er zijn nachtelijke slaapplaats ook bedrijven die slechts gedeeltelijk kunnen herstarten zullen gecompenseerd moeten blijven worden opdat ze niet omvallen inkomen sociaalbestek juni 2020 6 hopen dat een groot deel ervan overeind blijft na afloop van de coronacrisis de noodmaatregelen lijken op het eerste gezicht -wanneer ze lang genoeg geldig blijven -redelijk te passen bij de huidige situatie toch vallen er wel een paar kanttekeningen bij te maken maar eerst wil ik even kijken naar de maatregelen die getroffen zijn in het kader van de preventie en het voorkomen van betalingsachterstanden en schulden al heel snel na het afkondigen van de eerste coronamaatregelen was duidelijk dat grote groepen nederlanders niet alleen een forse inkomensachteruitgang zouden gaan ervaren zij zullen als gevolg daarvan ook niet aan hun lopende verplichtingen kunnen voldoen betalingsachterstanden zullen ontstaan wanneer mensen een fors deel van hun inkomen verliezen veel jongeren hebben hun inkomen al helemaal zien wegvallen zij hebben op zn best drie maanden recht op een kortdurende ww-uitkering maar ook anderen zullen betalingsachterstanden moeten laten ontstaan omdat de verplichtingen niet snel kunnen worden teruggeschroefd zorgverzekering huur energie water verzekeringen mobiele abonnementen et cetera  tot slot is er een vraag die de afgelopen tien jaar regelmatig is gesteld maar nooit is beantwoord in de vorm van een aanpassing van het systeem er is niet nagedacht over een algemene inkomensof bestaanszekerheidsgarantie al dan niet in de vorm van een basisinkomen mensen zullen dus bij overgang van de ene inkomstenbron werk naar andere inkomstenbronnen uitkeringen nog steeds geconfronteerd worden met weken of langer zonder inkomen of een dergelijke garantie de vorm aanneemt van een onvoorwaardelijk basisinkomen een garantie via de belastingdienst of een negatieve inkomstenbelasting zoals de earned income tax credit uit de vs is niet zo belangrijk belangrijk is dat we moeten constateren dat er niet over is nagedacht en dat zon garantie er dus niet is in het verlengde daarvan is het systeem van toeslagen dat inkomensdalingen voor een deel zou kunnen opvangen niet vereenvoudigd en is de uitvoering ervan niet gemoderniseerd ook andere oplossingen zijn niet in beeld gekomen zoals het verschuiven van belastingen van arbeid naar arbeidsloos inkomen winst dividend erfenissen en dergelijke het risico is daarmee levensgroot dat na deze crisis de rijksten wederom veel rijker zijn geworden en de armen nog armer de eerste bewijzen zijn daarvoor inmiddels aanwezig 6 het is nu nog niet te

others 3  subsequent studies demonstrated the ability of strain oc 3843 hereafter oc 43 to agglutinate certain erythrocytes and confirmed the identity of the strains by hal tests 4  several studies with cf neutralization and hal tests have demonstrated the epidemiologic and clinical features of respiratory illness caused by strain oc 43 infection in adults and children 5 6 7 8  in 1963 greig and girard reported an encephalomyelitis of swine in canada caused by a hemagglutinating virus 9  in 1968 a previously unrecognized disease in swine characterized by frequent vomiting decreased appetite wasting and a high mortality rate was observed in european countries 10 ii  the virus isolated was serologically identical to the strain previously isolated in canada in 1971 phillip et a1 12 described the morphology of the hemagglutinating virus by electron microscopy and reported that it resembled the coronavirus group previously another disease of swine characterized by vomiting and wasting and caused by a nonhemagglutinating virus called transmissible gastroenteritis virus had also been proposed as a candidate for the coronaviridae 13  however until recently no outbreaks of encephalomyelitis in swine have been recognized in the united states in 1972 mengeling et al 14 reported the characteristics of a coronavirus isolated in embryonic pig kidney cell culture epk from the nasal cavity of a healthy adult pig this isolate designated hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus hev strain 67n was found to be serologically identical to previous isolates pathogenicity characterized by anorexia listlessness vomiting and some respiratory distress was demonstrated by experimental administration of hev strain 67n to newborn pigs 15  antigenic analyses of certain coronaviruses have been hampered by a lack of suitable host systems and comparable serologic tests therefore the purpose of this study was twofold we have 1 demonstrated the adaptation of hev to growth in 5mb a finding which facilitated serologic tests with strain oc 43 by the use of common host reagents and 2 investigated the possible relationship between hev and coronavirus strain oc 43 with use of animal and human sera viruses the coronavirus strain oc 43 which had been isolated in human embryonic tracheal organ culture and subsequently adapted to 5mb was used for production of reagent 1  the 26th passage of hev strain 67n in epk was received from dr w l mengeling u s department of agriculture usda ames iowa this strain was subsequently passaged in our laboratory by the intracerebral ic route in three-day-old 5mb derived from pregnant swiss white icr mice free of mhv all colonies bred at the center for disease control cdc atlanta ga lawrenceville facility are

2 hr in 25 buffered glutaraldehyde these blocks were then fixed in 1 os04 dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in an araldite-epon mixture 17  sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a philips em-200 or elj-300 electron microscope operating at 60 kv production of antigen antigens for coronavirus strain oc 43 were prepared as previously described 4  antigens for hev were prepared with a 10 suspension of infected 5mb in pbs ph 72 for hal tests and in veronal buffered diluent ph 73 for cf tests control antigens were prepared from normal smb in a similar manner production of antisera immune sera were prepared in weanling mice as described previously 4  hyperimmune sera were prepared in six-week-old female mice by four weekly 05-mi ip inoculations of antigen plus freunds complete adjuvant sera acute-and convalescent-phase sera from children with upper respiratory tract illness and seroconversion to coronavirus strains oc 43 and 229e were collected during a longitudinal survey of respiratory illness conducted from 1960 to 1968 by the respiratory virology branch virology division cdc atlanta ga 6 18  paired sera from adults with respiratory illness possibly due to coronavirus strains oc 43 229e and b814 were acquired from drs a z kapikian national institutes of health bethesda md and sylvia reed common cold unit salisbury england sera from pigs infected with hev were obtained from dr w l mengeling usda ames iowa normal sera from humans and animals without respiratory illness were obtained from several sources control sera were collected from children who participated in studies of respiratory illness 6 18  sera were acquired before vaccination from college students and retirees involved in influenza vaccine studies conducted by the cdc single samples of sera from employees of three different meat-packing houses a b and c were donated by dr marshall fox of the cdc single samples of sera from abbatoir employees veterinary students and swine producers and from 80 swine were acquired from dr george t rvood university of illinois urbana ill serologic tests hal tests were performed by the microtiter technique with pbs diluent and 05 adult chicken erythrocytes 19  the laboratory branch complement fixation test was also performed by a microtiter technique 20  all neutralization tests in our laboratory were performed by the constant virus-varying serum method in three-day-old suckling mice via the ic route doses of --100 ld 50 of virus ic were used all sera were inactivated at 56 c for 30 min five mice were used for each dilution of serum and for back-titrations of virus tests were concluded after 14 days serum titers of virus were calculated by the karber method 21  electron microscopy the similarity in structure and morphology of hev to other members of the coronavirus group is shown in figure 1 hev is --100 nm in size and possesses widely spaced club-shaped projections that are --20 nm in length the shape and spacing of the projections are the distinguishing features of coronaviridae that set them apart from negatively staining members of the orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae in thin sections of 5mb early stages of viral replication are indicated by the accumulation of electron-dense material adjacent to the intracytoplasmic membranes of the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum bud formation takes place at such sites and some of the budding particles can be seen in figure 2 single arrowheads these typical morphological characteristics are shared by other members of the coronavirus group 22  specificity in table 1 the relationship be- tween hev and mhv is demonstrated by cf tests of specific hyperimmune mouse sera reciprocal cf tests showed only a one-way cross-reaction between hev and mhv the existence of the cross-reaction could not be confirmed by hal because of the absence of a lvihv hemagglutinin antigenic relationship in table 2 the relationship between coronavirus strain dc 43 and hev is demonstrated by hal cf and neutralization tests of specific immune and hyperimmune mouse sera the results reveal a two-way cross-reaction between strain dc 43 and hev in both types of sera tested by all serologic methods used however titers of antibody to dc 43 antigen in hev-immune serum were at least twofold to fourfold higher than were titers of antibody to hev antigen in strain dc 43immune serum antibody responses the hal antibody response to hev antigen in the sera of 97 children who showed seroconversion to coronavirus antigen of either strain dc 43 or strain 229e is noted in table 3 chidren with dc 43 seroconversions demonstrated a higher prevalence of antibody to hev 24 in convalescent-phase sera than did children with seroconversion to coronavirus strain 229e 15 in addition three children who showed seroconversion to strain dc 43 also had seroconversion to hev antigens however no child with seroconversion to strain 229e had seroconversion to hev antigens in table 4 antibody responses to oc 43 and hev antigens by hal cf and neutralization tests are shown for human adults and swine with known infections due to coronavirus patients infected with strain oc 43 had antibody and seroconversion to hev antigens but titers of hev antibody were always lower than homologous titers patients naturally or experimentally infected with coronavirus strains 229e or b814 did not convert serologically to either oc 43 or hev however patients with b814 infection who also had oc 43 antibody had low titers of antibody to hev one of the two pigs infected with hev converted serologically to strain oc 43 but the titers of antibody to oc 43 were substantially lower than titers of antibody to hev antibody responses to oc 43 and hev antigens by hal tests in normal human populations and swine are demonstrated in table 5 the prevalence of antibody to coronavirus strain oc 43 in every human population studied ranged from 75 in retirees to 99 in abattoir employees prevalence of antibody to hev in humans was strain oc 43 were found in all human populations studied however significantly lower p  005 prevalences were found among meatpacking house employees swine producers abattoir employees and veterinary students 18-32 than among retirees children and college students 32-67 in addition there were 15 individuals who had only hev antibody responses no titers of antibody to dc 43 were detectable in the normal swine sera tested however 38 of the swine revealed hev antibody with a reciprocal gmt of 60 discussion lower than the prevalence of oc 43 antibody in every population studied ranging from 31 in college students to 78 in employees of meatpacking house b however significant differences in prevalence of hev antibody were seen among populations who mayor may not have had contact with swine the observed prevalence of antibody to hev was significantly higher p  005 in veterinary students 61 swine producers 71 abattoir employees 72 and employees of meat-packing houses a b and c 60-78 than in college students children and retirees 31-43 the reciprocal geometric mean titers gmt for oc 43 antibody ranged from 17 to 48 whereas titers of antibody to hev ranged from 12 to 16 in all human populations tested however 22 individuals had hev antibody titers that were greater than titers of oc 43 antibody by twofold or more individuals with antibody only to although infections wi th coronavirus strain dc 43 in humans are fairly well defined infections caused by other dc isolates are less well characterized 1 24  also human coronaviruses may be responsible for exacerbations of symptoms in children with asthma and in adults with chronic pulmonary disease 25 26  however the significance of coronavirus-like particles observed by electron microscopy in association with other human diseases remains uncertain 27 28 29 30 31  coronaviruses have also been shown to be the etiologic agents in or candidates for a wide variety of diseases in different animal species 32  previous studies have demonstrated the presence in humans of antibody to other animal coronaviruses 33 34 35  serologic cross-reactions have also been established among and between certain human and animal strains 2 4 12 23 35 36 37  specific immune or hyperimmune sera can be used to determine the extent and direction of antigenic note data are given as reciprocal titers numbers in parentheses are titers of homologous antibody sera obtained before inoculation and included in these tests had no detectable antibody to coronavirus strain oc 43 or to hev antigens control cf antigens did not fix complement with these sera at a dilution of 1 8 relationships however the interpretation of antibody responses to coronavirus infections in humans is complicated by the knowledge that the response might not be primary thus heterotypic antibody mayor may not be expected 23 38 39 40  in our study the adaptation of hev to growth in 5mb was demonstrated by electron microscopy specificity was also confirmed by the lack of reci procal cf antibody response between hev and lfhv and the ability of hev-infected 5mb to agglutinate certain erythrocytes the adaptation of hev to 5mb facilitated serologic testing with coronavirus strain dc 43 by the use of com- kaye et al mon host reagents and compatible animal systems serologic testing revealed a two-way cross-reaction between dc 43 and hev in specific immune animal sera the cross-reaction became more apparent when the animals were hyperimmunized however the titers of heterologous antibody were always at least fourfold lower than the titers of homologous antibody in all serologic tests prevalence of antibody to hev was higher in children infected with strain dc 43 than in children infected with strain 229e in addition antibody responses in adults with known infection who demonstrated conversion to strain dc 43 have also shown seroconversion to hev conversely sera from adults known to be infected with coronavirus strains other than dc 43 demonstrated no serologic conversion to hev antigens however in all cases titers of antibody to hev were lower than titers of antibody to dc 43 antibodies to both strain dc 43 and hev were found in normal human sera collected from the various groups studied the gmt of dc 43 antibody was higher than the gmt of hev antibody in every group tested furthermore there were considerably more individuals with only dc 43 antibody in their sera than with only hev antibody sera from normal herds of swine with antibody to hev revealed no antibody to oc 43 antigens in almost every instance the gmt of antibody to hev in swine was at least fourfold higher than the gmt of hev antibody in humans sera from pigs infected with hev demonstrated oc 43 antibody and seroconversion but the titers of this antibody were considerably lower than the homologous titers of antibody to hev the serologic evidence in this study suggests that antibody to hev in humans probably represents a heterologous response to infection with coronavirus strain oc 43 however several contradictory points must be considered 1 hev antibody was found more often in individuals who might have had contact with swine 2 conversely antibody to oc 43 alone was found more often in individuals who had less possibility of contact with swine 3 22 individuals had titers of antibody to hev at least twofold higher than titers of antibody to oc 43 and 4 sera from 15 individuals had only antibody to hev of these subjects 14 had possible contact with swine however there is no direct evidence isolation of virus at this time that humans in contact with swine acquire any respiratory or nonrespiratory disease caused by hev nevertheless in view of the serologic relationships between human and animal coronaviruses and the clinical nature of the coronaviruslinked diseases involved the possibility of human infection with hev cannot be excluded 41j in conclusion the evidence of antibody to hev in human sera represents 1 a heterologous antibody response to infection with coronavirus strain oc 43 2 a heterotypic response to as yet unknown or uncharacterized strains possibly related to oc 43 or 3 a subclinical or unrecognized infection with hev therefore further studies are needed to clarify the serologic relationships among and between human and animal coronaviruses now available to isolate and characterize newcoronavirus strains and to survey properly controlled human populations that have contact with swine for evidence of

leo sin linfa wang vernon lee j   as of april 15 2020 more than 19 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and more than 120 000 deaths from the disease have been recorded worldwide1 many initial cases reported outside of china were imported or were linked to travellers from china2 3 however as community transmission has become widespread the source of cases of covid-19 in several countries has not been established in singapore a globally connected city-state in southeast asia health officials have attempted to contain the spread of covid-19 through intensive epidemiological investigations coupled with isolation of cases and quarantine of close contacts however establishing the source of infection to ascertain the possible extent of spread can be difficult because scant epidemiological data might be available even when possible nodes of transmission are retrospectively identified through epidemiological investigations nucleic acid-based tests would not be diagnostically useful if these infected individuals have recovered and no longer shed the virus hence serological tests are needed to identify convalescent cases and aid investigations and containment efforts we present findings of investigations from jan 29 to feb 24 2020 that linked two people with covid-19 from wuhan china to three clusters of covid-19 cases in singapore serological testing had a crucial role in establishing a link between clusters showing its use in identifying convalescent covid-19 cases and supporting epidemiological investigations in singapore several surveillance methods are used to identify people with covid-19 on jan 2 2020 a suspect case-definition of covid-19 was circulated to all doctors in singapore4 doctors are legally required to notify the ministry of health of cases of covid-195 from jan 31 2020 singapore began testing all patients with pneumonia in hospital for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this testing was later expanded to include people with pneumonia in primary care the diagnosis of covid-19 is confirmed either by a respiratory sample testing positive for sars-cov-2 using a laboratory-based rt-pcr6 or by a serum sample testing positive for sars-cov-2 on serological analysis7
 
research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed on march 3 2020 for reports on serological testing in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 we used the keywords covid-19 or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 and serology or serologic testing our search did not identify any reports of the epidemiological application of serological tests in covid-19 in one report researchers described serological characteristics of covid-19 and in other publications researchers have commented on the potential importance of covid-19 serological tests in another study epidemiological investigations were reported of the epidemic in singapore but serological methods had not been used
added value of this study
in our epidemiological investigation we used rt-pcr and serological testing to diagnose cases of covid-19 and establish links between clusters rt-pcr testing alone is limited by its ability to detect convalescent cases of covid-19 because rt-pcr can only detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the period of viral shedding which is the acute phase of infection serological testing can be useful in detecting previous infection in people with suspected infection who have recovered assisting in epidemiological investigation and containment efforts
implications of all the available evidence
covid-19 laboratory testing is focused on use of quantitative rt-pcr for diagnosis and serological testing can be overlooked we have highlighted the importance of serological testing for epidemiological investigation of covid-19 cases and we urge further development of serological testing capabilities
 once individuals with covid-19 were identified their activities from 14 days before symptom onset until they were isolated were mapped and their close contacts traced contact tracing before symptom onset was done to identify the source of exposure that led to the case being infected allowing for further active case-finding around the source contact tracing after symptom onset until isolation was done to identify exposed individuals for quarantine to break the transmission chain both these approaches were part of the containment strategy a close contact was defined as anyone who had prolonged contact within 2 m of the case all close contacts with active or recent symptoms were tested whereas those who were asymptomatic and exposed while the case was symptomatic were quarantined activity maps were reviewed and cross-checked to establish potential exposures and identify possible epidemiological links between cases and clusters all epidemiological investigations and outbreak containment measures were implemented under the infectious diseases act5 which allows use of data for analysis to control outbreaks for laboratory confirmation of covid-19 we did rt-pcr testing for sars-cov-2 using previously published methods6 two serological platforms were developed for confirmation of specific antibody responses to sars-cov-2 in people with suspected infection or individuals with pcr-confirmed disease a virus neutralisation test vnt was established at the duke-national university of singapore medical school absl3 facility using a sars-cov-2 virus isolate betacovsingapore22020 gisaid accession number epiisl407987 cultured from a patient in singapore vnt was done using protocols previously published for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov7 for elisa assays we used recombinant nucleocapsid protein from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 expressed in mammalian cell culture using the pcdna31 vector thermofisher scientific carlsbad ca usa according to previously published methods8 and a recombinant receptor binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein custom-produced by a commercial provider genscript piscataway nj usa elisa wells were coated with 100 ng of the respective protein per well and serum samples were used at dilutions from 150 to 1400 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human igg santa cruz dallas tx usa used at a dilution of 12000 the funders had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication as of april 6 2020 singapore had recorded 1375 cases of covid-19 of which 554 were imported and 821 locally transmitted three clusters were identified that involved two churches church a and church b and one family gathering these clusters comprised 28 locally transmitted cases the clusters were linked to two travellers w1 and w2 from wuhan china who attended a church service at church a on jan 19 2020 figure 1
 the clusters at church a and church b were linked by one individual from church a a2 who probably transmitted the infection to the primary case of the church b cluster f1 at a family gathering on jan 25 2020 all cases were confirmed by rt-pcr testing except for a2 who was diagnosed by serological testing the clusters at church a and church b were detected in early february and mid-february respectively although w1 and w2 were diagnosed with covid-19 at the end of january their possible link to church a was only discovered after the church a cluster was identified through investigation and repeat interviews5 by that time a2 had recovered from covid-19 and was not immediately linked to either cluster family members who had been infected at the family gathering on jan 25 2020 were first linked to f1 and were initially regarded as part of the cluster at church b however subsequent investigations into case histories indicated that the family cluster was a distinct cluster and that a2 was most probably the missing link between the two church clusters this idea was substantiated when a2s serological results were confirmed to be positive five locally transmitted cases of covid-19 a1a5 were linked to church a these people attended a church service on jan 19 2020 the same day w1 and w2 visited the church although all five people had developed symptoms by feb 2 2020 figure 2
 only a1 a4 and a5 were diagnosed between feb 6 and feb 8 2020 because they had been hospitalised for pneumonia and tested for sars-cov-2 as part of enhanced surveillance measures to test all patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia a2 and a3 were not diagnosed when symptomatic in late january because their symptoms were mild and they did not meet the suspect case-definition at that time a2 and a3 were tested only after mapping of activities and movements of other cases suggested that a2 could be the missing link between the clusters at church a and church b an rt-pcr test of a nasopharyngeal specimen taken from a3 on feb 18 2020 was positive although this individual had clinically recovered from the illness which persisted from jan 28 to feb 10 2020 serological analysis of a serum sample obtained on the same day as the nasopharyngeal specimen was also positive although a2 had two negative rt-pcr tests the serological result was positive indicating past infection a2 and a3 attended a chinese new year family gathering on jan 25 2020 at the home of f1 nine cases a2 a3 and f1f7 were linked to this family gathering a2 whose symptoms started on jan 23 2020 was unwell at this event and most probably was the primary source of transmission a3 developed symptoms later on jan 28 2020 and was therefore unlikely to be the source of infection at this gathering 17 locally transmitted cases were linked to church b b1b16 and f1 thorough review of activity maps ascertained that f1 who had developed symptoms on jan 29 2020 and continued to work at church b while ill was the primary case of the church b cluster in mid-february epidemiological and clinical evidence strongly suggested that a2 was the missing link between the clusters at church a and church b through attendance at the family gathering on jan 25 2020 while symptomatic however by the time this link was ascertained more than 3 weeks had passed from symptom onset on jan 23 2020 and symptoms had resolved completely a week previously on feb 810 2020 a2 had two negative rt-pcr test results from samples taken from the nasopharynx with testing done 1 day apart on feb 18 and feb 19 2020 the sample for serological testing was taken on feb 18 2020 and a positive result was confirmed on feb 22 2020 elisa results for a2 and a3 on feb 20 2020 figure 3a
 showed a strong antibody response to the sars-cov-2 rbd protein which was not seen in serum samples from sars-cov patients the results were further confirmed by vnt on feb 22 2020 figure 3b this investigation shows how sars-cov-2 serological analysis elisa detecting igg and vnt detecting neutralising antibodies in addition to use of traditional epidemiological methods was important in establishing links among locally transmitted covid-19 cases and tracing the transmission chain to an imported source detection of covid-19 can be difficult because of the non-specific mild respiratory symptoms in many affected individuals and because some people might recover without being diagnosed9 although pcr tests offer a rapid diagnostic solution they can only detect sars-cov-2 during the period of viral shedding which is the acute phase of infection the duration of viral shedding for covid-19 is not certain10 but sars-cov data indicate that 21 days after symptom onset 53 of cases achieved viral clearance in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples11 as such pcr testing alone is limited by its ability to detect convalescent cases serological testing can be especially useful in detecting a previous suspected infection in people who have recovered for seroconversion kinetics past coronavirus studies indicate that all patients with middle east respiratory syndrome mers seroconverted 3 weeks after symptoms started12 and 93 of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars seroconverted at an average of 20 days from symptom onset11 the first preliminary analysis of sars-cov-2 igm and igg indicated that the antibody response in covid-19 patients is similar to if not earlier than these times13 cross-reactivity of immunoglobulins to closely related viruses such as sars-cov is a potential issue14 but our rbd-based elisa showed sufficient differentiation power a finding further supported by vnt results igm serological testing might hold promise as a diagnostic method although for sars and mers limitations for its use have been noted12 13 for mers igm was not detected earlier than igg and igm against prevalent human coronaviruses showed cross-reactivity12 preliminary data for sars-cov-2 igm are promising13 but more work is needed to assess the feasibility of igm serological analysis as a rapid diagnostic method to enhance covid-19 detection capabilities for most people in the three clusters we report here transmission of infection was accounted for by close contact with a symptomatic case our findings suggest that covid-19 is largely transmitted by close contact particularly when contact occurs over a prolonged period and in close congregation two churches were the setting for covid-19 transmission in our report a church cluster has also been reported in south korea15 churches host prolonged repeated activities during which close contact occurs thus providing the opportunity for disease spread through droplets or fomites singing a common practice in churches can generate droplets in a similar quantity to coughing16 17 repeated social interactions of church groups has also facilitated discovery of transmission compared with other settings in which people might not know each other the interactions are similar in nature to large family gatherings which other cases in our report were linked to other similar settings include school and workplaces in which respiratory disease transmission is not uncommon and should be the focus for preparedness surveillance and containment measures risk of transmission could be reduced if symptomatic people do not attend events in which prolonged social interactions take place eg at the family gathering when a2 was unwell and f1 who continued to work at church b while unwell other risk reduction measures could include having smaller group activities and prevention of interactions across these groups moreover there may be common touchpoints within each setting that could result in contact transmission to prevent transmission people should practice increased personal hygiene and reduce physical contact to minimise indirect transmission risks linking disease transmission to an imported source and contact tracing for each identified case has facilitated a high capture of cases in singapore this successful linking of a large proportion of cases to imported sources provides encouraging evidence that the intense containment measures undertaken in singapore have been effective the three clusters we report here occurred relatively early in the emergence of covid-19 in singapore within 4 weeks of the first imported case as the epidemic continues it might be progressively difficult to establish linkages by relying on traditional epidemiological methods alone challenges include difficulty in obtaining information from cases and contacts which could be inaccurate because of recall and other biases in our investigation information for symptom onset of w1 and w2 was based on case history alone and could not be independently corroborated5 in such instances determining the transmission chain would have to account for possible inconsistencies in case history and rely on triangulation with other methods the development and adoption of additional laboratory techniques such as serological tests and phylogenetic analysis by whole-genome sequencing could help identify possible links between cases serological testing is a key method in the response to the covid-19 epidemic as shown in our study it enabled detection of a convalescent case which could be key in initial containment efforts to discover transmission links to support containment efforts serological testing also detects people with mild or asymptomatic disease who have recovered allowing for more accurate determination of the number of people probably infected in a cluster or the population identifying people who were probably infected in household or school clusters could help ascertain attack rates by age particularly among children who mostly manifest less severe disease18 calculating population-level attack rates is also important to estimate disease incidence and the case-fatality rate cfr thus far the cfr for covid-19 has been based on pcr-diagnosed symptomatic cases serological surveys would be important to estimate cfr more accurately and would better inform calibrated responses to covid-19 as the pandemic progresses monitoring seroprevalence would enable countries to track transmission dynamics and population immunity levels and to inform disease control policies such monitoring would necessitate the development of ready serological testing solutions that are cost-effective and the establishment of population-level surveillance programmes to obtain blood samples development and application of serological assays has helped to unravel connections between three clusters of covid-19 in singapore linking the disease to two travellers from china serological assays should be considered to identify mild or subclinical infections in the community  diagnostic value and dynamic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019 yujiao

wuhan hubei province china huang et al 2020 the pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as it has a phylogenetic similarity to sars-cov zhu et al 2020 since then sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization who who 2020a as of march 4 2020 93091 laboratory-confirmed cases and 3198 deaths have been documented globally who 2020b coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the orthocoronavirinae subfamily although most human coronavirus infections are mild sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov  betacoronaviruses zoonotic in origin  have been associated with potentially fatal disease particularly during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively zaki et al 2012 zhong et al 2003 currently the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 a novel betacoronavirus is about 34 which is lower than the rate of 10 for sars-cov and 34 for mers-cov who 2020b who 2020c who 2020d however sars-cov-2 has potentially higher transmissibility than both sars-cov and mers-cov chen 2020 the rapid and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 contributes to disease and outbreak management by enabling prompt and accurate public health surveillance prevention and control measures real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr has been the primary means for diagnosing sars-cov-2 huang et al 2020 however molecular detection carries the risk of false-negatives because of low viral loads in specimens pang et al 2020 serological testing another common laboratory diagnostic can diagnose illness by detecting antibodies serological studies on sars-cov-2 appear to be scarce the aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serological detection to covid-19 and the dynamic variance of viral antibodies in sars-cov-2 infection a retrospective study was conducted at xixi hospital of hangzhou a designated hospital for emerging infectious disease in zhejiang province china from january 2020 to march 4 2020 case definitions of confirmed covid-19 are based on the who interim guidance who 2020e forty-three patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and at least one viral serological test performed in the hospital were enrolled in this study thirty-three patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in whom the disease was eventually excluded in the hospital and who quarantined at home were included as a control group the definition of suspected sars-cov-2 infection included a fever or any respiratory symptoms especially in those with a history of travel to wuhan or exposure to an infected case within 2 weeks before the onset of disease since january 2020 xu et al 2020 patients who were suspected to be infected were discharged from hospital once the results of two separate molecular tests performed with an interval of 24 h were negative the demographic and clinical data of these patients were extracted from their medical records twenty-four patients received laboratory confirmation at other hospitals and were transferred to xixi hospital of hangzhou oral swab or sputum specimens collected from the remaining 19 cases at admission were sent to the center for disease control of hangzhou and tested by real-time rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 rna laboratory confirmation of the virus was based on the result of real-time rt-pcr huang et al 2020 virus detection was repeated twice every 24 h fitness for discharge of covid-19 patients was based on a normal body temperature for at least 3 days with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from the upper respiratory tract on two occasions the study was approved by the ethics committee of xixi hospital of hangzhou and written informed consent was obtained from each participant serum was separated by centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min within 12 h of collection the sars-cov-2 igm and igg chemiluminescence immunoassay clia kits used in this study were supplied by shenzhen yhlo biotech co ltd china the magnetic beads of these clia assays are coated with two antigens of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein or n protein spike protein or s protein all serum antibody tests were performed with an iflash3000 fully automated clia analyzer from shenzhen yhlo biotech co ltd china sars-cov-2 igmigg titers in arbitrary units auml were calculated automatically by the immunoassay analyzer on the basis of relative light units rlu because the viral antibody titer is positively associated with rlu according to the manufacturers instructions the cut-off value for a positive sars-cov-2 igmigg result is 10 auml continuous variables were expressed as the mean  standard deviation sd if normally distributed or as the median interquartile range iqr if not categorical variables were described as the count  serum antibody titers before and after conversion to virus-negative were compared using the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test proportions for categorical variables were compared using fishers exact test all analyses were done with ibm spss statistics software version 230 a two-sided p-value of less than 005 was considered statistically significant forty-three patients with a laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection were included in the study among them 24 patients were transferred to xixi hospital of hangzhou after laboratory confirmation elsewhere and the remaining 19 patients were confirmed in the hospital thirty-three patients with suspected covid-19 in whom the disease was finally excluded were chosen as the control group the demographic and clinical characteristics of the covid-19 and control groups are shown in table 1
the median age of the covid-19 patients was 470 years iqr 340590 years ranging from 7 years to 74 years and 395 were male among both groups less patients had chronic disease including hypertension diabetes and liver disease fever was present in 628 of covid-19 patients before or on admission the second most common symptom was cough 605 similarly fever and cough were also the most common symptoms in the control group the duration from first symptoms to hospital admission to laboratory confirmation and to first serological test in the covid-19 group patients was 3 days iqr 27 days 3 days iqr 27 days and 18 days iqr 1123 days respectively among these patients two with a history of exposure to an infected case presented without any symptom until the first serological test in the control group the igm and igg positive rates were 0 033 and 91 333 respectively the igg titers of the three positive patients were all less than 15 auml in the covid-19 group 27 patients were tested for viral antibody before becoming virus-negative including oral swabs anal swabs or sputum the median duration from first symptoms to serological testing in these 27 patients was 16 days iqr 920 days among these people 13 were igm-positive 481 and 24 were igg-positive 889 three igg-negative patients were also igm-negative according to molecular detection as the gold standard the sensitivities of serum igm and igg antibodies to diagnose covid-19 were 481 1327 and 889 2427 respectively and the specificities were 100 3333 and 909 3033 respectively moreover the positive predictive values ppvs of igm and igg antibodies were 100 1313 and 889 2427 respectively and the negative predictive values npvs were 702 3347 and 909 3033 respectively after the 43 cases in the covid-19 group were laboratory-confirmed 98 serological tests were performed figure 1a shows that the igm-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased as the number of days from laboratory confirmation to serological detection increased in contrast the igg-positive rate increased to 100 and was higher than igm at all times meanwhile the virus-positive rate tended to decrease over time before laboratory confirmation two serological tests were performed in one case and viral igm and igg were both positive in two results figure 1b shows a similar trend as the duration from symptom onset to serological testing increased it was also found that both igm and igg levels were not high during the first 5 days following symptom onset in the covid-19 group 34 patients were tested for viral antibody after two oral swabs taken 24 h apart tested negative without other molecular detection positive the igm and igg positive rates were 559 1934 and 941 3234 respectively two igg-negative patients were also igm-negative the median igm and igg titers among these 34 people were 121 auml iqr 52466 auml and 1322 auml iqr 6551791 auml respectively all patients were discharged and the median time from this serological test to discharge was 2 days iqr 13 days among these 34 people who were tested after they were virus-negative 20 also had serological testing performed before they became virus-negative table 2
shows that the igm-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative the igg-positive rate was up to 90 and also not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative however the median igg titer after testing virus-negative was double that before and the difference was statistically significant the median interval between these two serological tests was 6 days iqr 49 days as the diagnosis of covid-19 is complicated by the diversity of symptoms and imaging findings molecular and serological detection tools are rapidly being developed laboratory confirmation of covid-19 has been based on a positive real-time rt-pcr result however molecular and serological studies on this virus appear to be scarce in this study 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and 33 suspected patients in whom the disease was finally excluded by nucleic acid test twice and who were rapidly discharged were included to investigate the diagnostic value of serological detection to covid-19 in addition the dynamic variance of viral antibodies during sars-cov-2 infection was also examined most of the infected patients in this study were female the age range of individuals was wide with children and those older than 65 years also being infected the proportion of patients with any co-existing illness among the infected individuals was low in this study consistent with the non-severe patients in the study by guan et al guan et al 2020 through the media and national advocacy people who had been in contact with an infected case as well as those with a suspected infection were asked to go to the hospital at an early stageas soon as possible furthermore xixi hospital of hangzhou was a designated tertiary hospital and mainly admitted patients with mild to moderate symptoms in hangzhou fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in concert with recent studies huang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 guan et al 2020 in the control group the patients were generally younger more often male and less commonly presented any co-existing illness when compared to those in the infected group in this study it was found that the specificities of serum igm and igg to diagnose covid-19 were both more than 90 when compared to molecular detection moreover the igg titers of the three positive patients in the control group were only weakly positive in the covid-19 group igm and igg were also both found to be positive in one case before laboratory confirmation for the first time therefore covid-19 should be considered when serum igm or igg is positive in the covid-19 patients the igg-positive rate 889 was found to be higher than the igm-positive rate 481 before conversion to virus-negative by molecular detection interestingly three igg-negative patients were also igm-negative in this study the duration from symptom onset to this serological test in these three patients was 0 days 5 days and 8 days respectively furthermore it was observed that serum viral antibodies increased only slightly in the early stage of the disease hence it may be that serum viral antibodies have not been produced yet and could be undetectable zhang et al found that the igm and igg positive rates were 50 and 81 on day 0 the day of first sampling and increased to 81 and 100 respectively on day 5 zhang et al 2020 thus covid-19 cannot be excluded at an early stage when viral serological testing is negative the igm-positive rate showed a trend to increase at first and then decline however the igg-positive rate increased and then became stable over time furthermore the igg-positive rate was consistently higher than the igm-positive rate and this phenomenon was also observed in the study by zhang et al 2020 there were two patients with both igm and igg negative after oral swabs were negative twice the interval between laboratory confirmation and serological testing was 10 days for one of these patients and 14 days for the other a lag period was found as antibodies specifically targeting mers-cov would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset al johani and hajeer 2016 therefore we cannot infer whether viral antibodies have not been produced yet or have turned negative because of the use of only one serological test as well as the high positive rate we found that the igg titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before in this study these covid-19 patients were discharged soon after oral swabs were negative on two occasions whether higher antibodies titers in sars-cov-2 infection are associated with better outcomes needs to be studied further this study has several limitations first only 43 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients and 33 controls were included therefore due to the small sample size the study results should be interpreted with caution second the time to viral molecular detection and to serological testing was variable and depended on clinician judgement as this was a retrospective study third since the infected patients included in this study were non-severe cases the value of serological testing in patients with severe cases of the disease needs to be assessed fourth the median duration from symptom onset to serological testing was long as viral serological detection kits were available late finally follow-up data on these individuals who were discharged are scarce in conclusion viral serological testing is an effective means of diagnosis for sars-cov-2 infection the positive rate and titer variance of igg are higher than those of igm in the course of covid-19 this study was supported by the research project on the prevention and treatment of covid-19 in hangzhou establishment of a clinical diagnosis and treatment system for covid-19 with treatment evaluation the study was approved by the ethics committee of xixi hospital of hangzhou and written informed consent was obtained from each participant

paper  molecular and serological tests for covid-19 a comparative review of sars-cov-2 coronavirus laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics robert kubina arkadiusz dziedzic   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 formerly known as 2019-ncov appeared in china for the first time and subsequently spread worldwide 12 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who officially announced the covid-19 epidemics as a threat to public health internationally and subsequently in march 2020 the global situation escalated into the covid-19 pandemic johns hopkins university reported over 7600000 cases of infection and more than 427000 deaths as of 13 june 2020 3 as a result of this rapidly progressing covid-19 pandemic and the limited laboratory-based molecular testing capacities new point-of-care poc scalable rapid diagnostic tests have been invented recently as easy-to-use tools to allow covid-19 diagnostics outside of laboratory settings what is more the urgent need to multiply testing for covid-19 has been clearly identified as an essential element of the anti-coronavirus strategy all over the world the diagnostic sensitivity specificity and accuracy concerning suspected covid-19 infection based on controlled testing and performance data from clinical settings is of substantial importance in the context of limiting the scope of coronavirus epidemics unreliable and unproved tests may not detect patients with active infection or may incorrectly indicate covid-19-negative patients as positive hampering healthcare efforts the diagnostic laboratory and point-of-care tests pocts used in order to detect sars-cov-2 are first of all reference tests based on molecular technique real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay rt-qpcr as well as serological antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting tests for auxiliary purposes at present only molecular quantitative reverse transcription pcr rt-qpcr testing of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the identification and laboratory confirmation of covid-19 cases as these methods were evaluated for their quality and safety through the world health organization who protocols 45 on the other hand based on current scientific evidence who recommends the use of poc immunodiagnostic tests for research purposes and at present they should not be utilized in a clinical decision-making setting and in patient care until fully validated with supporting data available however they can be useful in epidemiologic research or disease surveillance and further evolve as a critical step to develop covid-19 vaccine in future at the time of increased demand for hospital services clinicians governments and health services urgently need a fast sensitive but at the same time inexpensive diagnostic test in order to rapidly manage patients regarding admissions to hospitals meant for covid-19 treatment therefore the role of an approved and reliable diagnostic test in the covid-19 care pathway is of the utmost importance as in the case of other infectious diseases the rt-qpcr method as well as serological tests are suitable for the in vitro diagnostics ivd of patients suspected of being infected with sars-cov-2 genetic assay based on the rt-qpcr technique performed in real time especially plays a role at the early stages of viral infection when the virus multiplies quickly as this technique enables direct detection of the pathogens genetic material a different approach in diagnosing infection is represented by serological methods based on detectingin blood serumof antibodies that act specifically against viral proteins which are produced in response to sars-cov-2 serological ivd tests detect antibodies which are responsible for neutralizing the virus therefore this implies that they are used when the immunological reaction against sars-cov-2 virus is already taking place these ivd measures can determine how fast antibodies fighting the virus are produced which may influence the identification of subjects who already developed immunity the results of serological ivd tests should not be used as basis for diagnosing ruling out infection with sars-cov-2 or informing about infection status 6 the relatively quick discovery of the composition of the full genome of sars-cov-2 early during the epidemics made it easier to develop specific starters and normalized laboratory protocols for covid-19 the protocol of the first rt-qpcr test focused on rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp envelope e and nucleocapsid n of sars-cov-2 was published very early indeed at the end of january 2020 providing a brief description the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is equipped with a receptor-binding domain rbd a structure similar to the original sars-cov that emerged for the first time in 2002 functionally important orfs 1a and 1b and other main structural proteins including the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins are also well interrelated and clearly annotated according to previous reports the m and e proteins are essential for virus assembly while the s protein is crucial for affinity and attachment to host cells as the rbd of the s protein enables binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the s protein on the surface of the viral particles and has been reported to be highly immunogenic the n protein the main structural protein of sars-cov-2 is responsible for the transcription and replication of viral rna the packaging of the encapsulated genome into virions and interactions with the cell cycle of host cells in addition coronaviruses contain the n protein which has a substantial immunogenic ability and is abundantly expressed during viral infection figure 1 the sn proteins are targeted as potential antigens for serodiagnosis of covid-19 similarly to other diagnostic methods that were implemented for diagnosing sars disease based on sn proteins 7 the progress made in recent years in the diagnostics of infections enables the application often simultaneously of numerous methods in order to detect respiratory viruses effectively the choice of suitable tests depends upon the type of virus to be detected the presumed number of antigens patient population to be tested as well as the technical abilities and experience of the testing unit the validation of rt-qpcr tests seems to be an important step in combating the new coronavirus one of the most significant parameters regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic procedure is most probably the one related to the minimum amount of analyte which may be detected and quantitatively determine by means of a particular test the parameters describing those properties are known as limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq in many laboratories lod is used interchangeably with sensitivity analytical sensitivity orand detection limit this may be misleading though as sensitivity is also understood and used in other ways sensitivity and clinical diagnostic specificity are two different parameters diagnostic sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results to the sum of true positive and true negative results a sensitivity ratio of 100 implies that all the sick people have been identified the specificity of a test is the proportion of true negative results to the sum of true negative and false positive ones the specificity of 100 implies that all healthy people in a given test have been correctly identified as healthynot having the condition as indicated in table 2 sensitivity and specificity of tests is already about 100 with a few exceptions still one can notice differences in analytical sensitivity of the test lod the vast majority of molecular tests kits contain a so-called internal positive control ipc that can be utilized either as an extraction control or internal control the ipc is essential for an evaluation of whether the genetical material extraction procedure and amplification stage were carried out correctly the failure in ipc detection using a patients specimen may indicate the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical material as a consequence of nucleic acid loss or the transposition of pcr inhibitors and the lack of sufficient biological material in the collected sample it needs to be noted that many molecular tests may not provide sets for extraction stages and they need to be acquired separately however all tests reviewed here that detect the rna of sars-cov-2 contain ipc another important factor which describes a diagnostic test is the analytical specificity it is the ability of a test to detect a specific target eg a virus it is of great importance to check whether the starters used in pcr test are specific to a given virus there are two components of analytical sensitivity cross-reactivity and interference cross-reactivity may occur if in a sample collected from a patient there are organisms which are genetically related that imitate the virus analysed which causes test starters to cross react as shown in table 3 the producers have analysed their tests from the perspective of cross-reactivity unfortunately that analysis is selective and does not concern the same micro-organisms among the many contemporary technologies available special attention should be paid to rapid lateral flow immunoassay lfia also referred to as immunochromatographic tests perhaps they are not so much appreciated in the scientific community as pcr methods or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa tests despite the fact that they do find application in diagnostics more and more often they differ depending on the type of test but the basic principle of their action is invariably the samethey make use of the unique property that antibodies possess that of selective binding to a specific particle or group of similar particles antigen lfias provide an uncomplicated and relatively inexpensive tool meant for detecting the presence or absence of a given component in the examined specimen such as the presence of a virus in an analyzed blood sample examination with the use of those tests is possible for various types of test materialwhole human blood blood plasma serum stool urine sweat cerebrospinal fluid or even tears 9 the test principle is based on an immunological method using specific antibodies most often in complex with colloidal gold where a drop of the examined substance first moves along the nitrocellulose membrane using capillary phenomena after the sample is absorbed by the membrane the antigen should the test prove to be positive binds to the colloidal gold complex and respective antibodies consequently the effect of that reaction is the formation of a complex which will be detected by the test the interpretation of results consists of confirmation or ruling out of the presence of antigens in the examined sample based on color test strips that appear in the test 2122 the brief comparison of advantages and disadvantages of immunochromatographic tests is presented in table 4 at present most immunoenzymatic tests available are based on the immunochromatic technique the difference between those tests depends upon the molecule assayed pc or antigens structure performance time and diagnostic material it may be supposed that in future rapid tests will enable easier and quicker diagnostics of many diseases without the necessity of performing tedious and complicated procedures this would reduce the waiting time for obtaining results and accelerate decision making regarding suitable treatment 272829 the detection of specific sars-cov-2 serum antibodies allows for a rapid cost-effective and reasonably sensitive clinical diagnosis of covid-19 as immunoglobulins such as igm provide the initial humoral response during the first stage of viral infection prior to the onset of the adaptive high-affinity igg response essential for long-term immunological memory research indicates that after sars infection antibodies of the igm class may be detected in patients blood about 6 days after the infection while igg may be already detected after 8 days as sars-cov-2 belongs to the same large family of viruses which includes those causing middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it should be assumed that the process of producing antibodies will be similar to that in case of other viruses belonging to that family while the detection of igg antibodies and igm antibodies acting against sars-cov-2 may be an indication of infection moreover the detection of igm antibodies usually indicates a recent exposure to sars-cov-2 whereas the detection of igg antibodies in case of covid-19 indicates exposure to the virus some time ago 30 serological tests detecting solely the igm class of antibodies should find applications for diagnostic purposes when using tests which detect both igm and igg antibodies one should remember that a positive result may be the evidence of past infection not active infection table 5 negative results from serological tests do not exclude sars-cov-2 infection as the window period delay in the production of antibodies may exceed 7 days serological tests may also give false positive results this may be the case of past or ongoing infection with virus strains other than sars-cov-2 such as coronavirus hku1 nl63 oc43 or 229e moreover the first tests assessing the titer of iga class antibodies have been launched which from the perspective of immunology is of extreme importance as it provides the possibility of testing for antibodies in a material other than blood samples collected from patients eg respiratory tract secretions serological tests are thus applied as an adjunctive method for monitoring the epidemiological situation yet they may be performed faster and are less costly than genetic tests this diagnostic method has a limited sensitivity yet efforts to improve it are ongoing as it is useful for monitoring the infection due to insufficient data concerning among others the dynamics of immunological response to infection and the diagnostic value of available tests for detecting igm and igg class antibodies comprising sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive value in many countries it is currently not recommended to use serological tests for diagnostic purposes table 6 displays the evaluation of serological tests validated by the fda and table 7 provides a comparison of the selected immunochromatographic tests for sars-cov-2 based on sensitivity specificity sample type and test performance time in serological ivd the so-called window period is of much importancethat is the time when specific antibodies are not yet detectable in a patients blood in the initial phase of an infection the production of antibodies is initiated but their level is still low and thus test results may prove negative anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies appear quite late ie a few days after clinical manifestations which is why serological tests cannot be used as a basic tool in diagnosing sars-cov-2 infections 32 the detection of specific anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies is possible about 10 days after the first clinical manifestations of infection thus this serves the purpose of confirming contact with coronavirus and is of enormous importance from an epidemiological perspective as it allows us to detect subjects who had the infection but were asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic and could have been the source of infection for other people silent carriersvectors it also allows us to determine the spread of covid-19 infection in the population a comparative review of currently available serological immunodiagnostic covid-19 tests is presented in table 8 the protein microarray method pmm is a proteomic screening technique serving the purpose of simultaneousparallel quantitative and qualitative analysis of mixtures containing many proteins the chip used is composed of a supporting surface eg modified glass plate nitrocellulose membrane or microtitration plate on which the matrix of capturing proteins is immobilized in accordance with the determined formula performing the function of a probe the material captured may be antibodies enzymes or ligands protein analyte added to the matrix may be modified by means of various types of markers among others radioisotopes fluorescence luminescence markers the interaction between micromatrix proteins and analyte induces an analytical signal registered by means of suitable equipment the advantages of protein micromatrices include the short time required for analysis modest consumption of samples and reagents high sensitivity automation of testing they allow us to investigate the functions and effects of proteins on large scale 3334 the newly developed pepperchip sars-cov-2 proteome microarray pepperprint based on the sars-cov-2 genome derived from the virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 enables us to serologically screen about 5000 individual peptides spanning the whole viral proteome sequences of orf1ab protein surface glycoprotein orf3a protein coat protein membrane glycoprotein orf6 protein orf7a protein orf8 protein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and orf10 protein have been elongated and connected by means of neutral gsgsgsg connectors the elongated protein sequences have been transcribed into 4883 different peptides composed of 15 amino acids printed in two repetitions 9766 peptide sites in order to obtain high-resolution epitope data in the case of sars-cov which emerged in 2002 it was demonstrated that the application of pmm is characterized by enhanced sensitivity as more chinese subjects were diagnosed as sars-positive when applying pmm in comparison with elisa tests the pmm seems to be more reliable as it allows us to determine more protein antigens of the virus 35 an additional advantage of such tests is the possibility of automating the entire analytical process unfortunately the method has several imperfections including the repeatability of the test itself while the cost of the testing and equipment used for micromatrix diagnostics is significant which makes the pmm method less accessible in standard laboratory settings 36 undoubtedly the scalable and reliable pocts used in the community and outside laboratories would have the opportunity to reduce the time to obtain covid-19 diagnostic results and might support early implementation of isolation resources and infection control measures from a medical workforce point of view antibody- and antigen-detecting tests appear to have a significant role in identifying healthcare workers who recovered from sars-cov-2 infection to assess their suitability to provide frontline health services on the other hand the false negative serology tests could cause spread of covid-19 unjustified reassurance and a change in public behavior undoubtedly the negative results of serology tests swabs should not be treated as definitive for ruling out but a positive test results are beneficial to rule in coronavirus infection the sufficient accuracy of serology tests used more widely will allow us to make an appropriate decision regarding lifting restrictions on a national level nevertheless the wider implementation of pocd will ultimately support public health strategies about the potential lifting of social distancing restrictions in future 30 moreover with the limited data available at present for antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting rapid pocd further intense research into their potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged if these tests demonstrate adequate accuracy it is likely that they could potentially be used as triage tests for quick identification of patients who are suspected of contracting covid-19 reducing the need for expensive reference molecular pcr testing 46 finally it is worth noting the psychological and behavioral consequences of correctly established and known immunity status within the community recently a test has been developed based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprcas12a with visual readouts the test can detect 10 copies of the virus gene in merely 45 min providing simple and reliable diagnostic method which additionally demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in order to enable fast diagnosis at the hospital or on admission the test has been provided with an ssdna reporter labeled with a blank green fluorescent particle which will be split off by the cas12a protein when the nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 is found in the detection system in this way a green signal of fluorescence will be obtained visible with the naked eye in the light with a wavelength of 485 nm the high specificity of the test was obtained by designing 15 crrnas which may distinguish the polymorphisms of a single nucleotide with other viruses related to sars in four domains orf1a or orf1b n and e genes 37 the search for new diagnostic methods is continued because sars-cov-2 is spread by droplets while the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity index for rt-qpcr tests is the highest for broncho-alveolar lavage bal higher than for sputum or nosethroat swabs scientists recently proposed the use of exhaled breath condensate ebc for diagnostic purposes ebc is most similar in its biochemical composition and origin to bal examinations with the use of ebc are a relatively novel diagnostic method used mainly to assess inflammation within the respiratory tract and its components reflect the composition of the fluid lining the bronchi and alveoli ebc is a condensed form of small droplets of the fluid lining the lungs which is usually exhaled it contains various components from small ions to proteins and organelles it may even contain viruses fungi and bacteria taking samples of the condensate is safe totally non-invasive easy to perform it may be repeated many times it may also be performed on patients with severe complications of covid-19 its enormous advantage is that in may be performed in small children with the use of special facial masks the course of the examination is such that the patient is requested to exhale when breathing uneventfully for some 10-15 min to an apparatus provided with a cooling system which allows us to accumulate the condensate in which sars-cov-2 may be detected the application of this method seems justified from a public health perspective the false positive results that are presently obtained contribute the continued spread of the virus worldwide 3839 the optimization of laboratory diagnostics is the most dynamically developing field in the time of the covid-19 pandemic supporting contemporary medicine government decisions and healthcare strategies the efforts of scientistclinician teams focus first of all upon implementing the most reliable diagnostic tools however because covid-19 is a new nosological entity there are not enough data as of yet that would enable the determination of standards for the interpretation of serological pocts as with any other infectious diseases the diagnostic value of a test is not only about the method of collecting the material the quality of the sample and the equipment applied equally essential pre-analytical considerations are also the time point when a sample is collected as well as a suitable procedure storage and handling prior to analysis from the moment of collecting the biological material to the assaying stage  estimating seroprevalence with imperfect serological tests exploiting cutoff-free approaches judith bouman a sebastian bonhoeffer roland regoes r  large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current coronavirus pandemic serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and define cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives with the imperfect tests that are currently available to test for past sars-cov-2 infection the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of seroprevalence and is usually corrected post-hoc to account for the sensitivity and specificity here we use a likelihood-based inference method -previously called mixture models -for the estimation of the seroprevalence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure we confirm that this likelihood-based method outperforms the methods based on cutoffs and post-hoc corrections leading to less variation in point-estimates of the seroprevalence and its temporal trend we illustrate how the likelihood-based method can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests we also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the tests ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence lastly we show how this approach can be used to identify classes of case sera with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures that have not been used for test validation an r-package with the likelihood and power analysis functions is provided our study advocates to using serological tests without cutoffs especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals this approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods with post-hoc correction at exactly the low seroprevalence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in covid-19 serosurveys as other pathogens sars-cov-2 elicits antibody responses in infected people that can be detected in their blood serum as early as a week after the infection until long after recovery the presence of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies can therefore be used as a marker of past infection and the prevalence of seropositive people ie people with specific antibodies is a key measure to determine the extent of the coronavirus pandemic the serological tests however are usually not perfect yielding false positive and negative results here we exploit an approach that refrains from classifying people as seropositive or negative but rather compares the antibody level to that of confirmed cases and controls this approach leads to more reliable seroprevalence estimates especially for the low prevalence and low test accuracies that we face during the current coronavirus pandemic we also show how this approach can be extended to infer the presence of cases that have not been used for validating the test such as people that underwent a mild or even asymptomatic infection  serological tests can be used to determine the infection history on two levels the level of single individuals or that of an entire population if infection leads to immunity determining the infection history of an individual can be very useful in the context of the coronavirus crisis for example it has been suggested that seropositive people could go back to work without posing a risk to themselves or others in germany and italy among other countries there is even a discussion about issuing certificates of seropositivity 1 2  such a use of serological tests requires very high test quality in particular a low false positive rate another to this date more common use of serological tests are serosurveys to determine the total number of cumulative infections in a population serosurveys are usually conducted after an epidemic leaving enough time for test refinement in the current situation however an estimate of the true extent of the covid-19 pandemic in different countries is urgently needed to make policy decisions this pressure may limit the time available to improve the tests currently available serological tests have high specificity and relatively low sensitivity 3 4  as expected for this type of testing 5  studies which evaluated the tests on severe cases report high specificity and sensitivity 6  however the discriminatory power of the tests is less clear for mild cases and even asymptomatic cases 7  less than ideal sensitivity and specificity are known to introduce biases in the estimation of seroprevalence post-hoc corrections of the binomial estimator of seroprevalence have been developed and refined over the past decades 8 9 10  such a correction has recently been used in the estimation of the seroprevalence in the coronavirus pandemic 11  a bayesian version of the correction has been proposed to infer age-stratified seroprevalences in the context of epidemiological transmission models 12  however the corrections work well only for high seroprevalence and relatively high specificity in this study we use an alternative approach to deal with imperfect tests when estimating seroprevalence this approach has been used before for several other pathogens 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  rather than relying on dichotomized serological test data ie a positive or negative test result for each individual in the cohort and correcting post-hoc for the tests sensitivity and specificity this method uses the quantitative test measures together with data on the distribution of these measures in controls and conformed cases such quantitative measures differ depending on the diagnostic techniques used in elisa-based serological tests fluorescence is determined in units of optical density or arbitrary units tests involving neutralization assays usually report the serum titers needed to achieve viral neutralization of a certain level eg nt50 the method works irrespective of the type of assay that is used and we refer to the assay results generically as the quantitative test measures we show that this inference framework enables us to estimate seroprevalence and its change over time without bias we confirm that cutoffs introduced to dichotomize serological tests results lead to strong biases most importantly however the alternative inference method outperforms the classical rogan-gladen corrections especially for low seroprevalence and low test accuracies we demonstrate how the alternative inference method can be used in power analyses of serosurveys specifically we determine the minimal sample size needed to estimate the seroprevalence with less than 25 deviation of its true value for tests of a given accuracy we also investigate how many control and case sera are required to quantitatively capture the distribution of test measures in these two groups with enough certainty to allow the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence moreover we introduce an extended likelihood that allows the detection of a discrepancy between the serological observations in the epidemiological surveys and the quantitative test measures collected during the validation phase of the of the serological assay this does not only allow us to identify a missing case distribution of for instance mild cases but also to estimate the relative prevalence of those missing cases  to compare the likelihood-based inference method to classical cutoff-based methods without and with the rogan-gladen correction we simulated serosurveys conducted with serological tests of varying accuracies as a proxy for the accuracy we used the area under the roc-curve auc-roc and varied it from 07 to 1 this range is consistent with the auc-roc values of many diagnostic tools across disciplines 20  the sensitivity and specificity corresponding to the standard cutoffs across the range of auc-roc values we consider here are given in fig s2  in the simulated serosurveys we assumed seroprevalences of 1 4 and 8 and involved 10 000 virtual individuals we then derived estimates of the seroprevalence with cutoff-based methods without and with the rogan-gladen correction and the likelihood-based method the results of these analyses are shown in fig 1 our analysis confirms the strong biases in the estimate of the seroprevalence derived with the two traditional cutoff-based methods without correction for the high specificity-method in which the specificity is set to 99 and the sensitivity is calculated according to the assumed test accuracy the prevalence is underestimated for the method where the cutoff maximizes the youden index seroprevalence is overestimated additionally the dichotomization by a cutoff leads to a reduction in the variation of the point-estimates this seeming increased reliability of the estimates however is an artefact of the dichotomization and should not be interpreted as an advantage of these methods we find that the common rogan-gladen correction 8 see methods largely alleviates the biases in the estimation of seroprevalence see fig 1  note that for low prevalence levels or low test accuracy the corrected point estimate of the prevalence can become negative this is due to the fact that the number of observed seropositives -being a realization of a stochastic process -can be smaller than the expected number of false positives for the same reason the rogan-gladen correction give rise to more variable estimates compared to the likelihood-based method for low seroprevalence levels and low test accuracies in contrast the likelihood-based method does not inflate the variation of point-estimates and does not result in negative seroprevalence estimates for any true seroprevalence level or test accuracy note that the variation in point estimates is strongly correlated with the variation of bootstrap estimates see fig s3  thus the insights into the variation are also informative on the width of the confidence intervals for each method the variability in the rogan-gladen corrected point-estimates is very similar to the variability in the estimates obtained by using the bayesian correction see methods and fig s4 a  however the confidence intervals of the rogan-gladen corrected point-estimates are larger than the credible intervals obtained for the bayesian corrections fig s4 b  in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic the seroprevalence is still increasing and an estimation of its temporal trend is an urgent public health objective to assess how well the different methods can estimate temporal trends in seroprevalence we simulated serosurveys during an ongoing epidemic in particular we assumed that the seroprevalence increases from 15 to 15 we found that the uncorrected cutoff-based method both underestimate the temporal trend in seroprevalence fig 2  the correction removes the bias in the estimate but introduces a large variation in the point-estimates of the temporal trend the estimate for the temporal trend can even be negative for the reason mentioned above in contrast the likelihood-based method leads to more reliable point-estimates the temporal trend without inflating their variation low specificitysensitivity can be compensated by enrolling more people to understand how the test accuracy affects the statistical power of serosurveys for the likelihood-based method we simulated many serosurveys with tests characterized by varying auc-roc values and evaluated their success a serosurvey was defined to be successful if the estimate of the seroprevalence was sufficiently close to the true seroprevalence see methods the statistical power is defined as the fraction of successful in silico serosurveys we find that low accuracy of the serological test can be compensated by higher sample sizes  fig 3a  for example to achieve a statistical power of 09 1000 individuals need to be enrolled into the serosurvey for a high-accuracy test auc-roc098 in contrast for a lower accuracy test auc-roc08 5000 are required  fig 3b  the number of case and control sera used for validation of serological tests impacts the reliability of the seroprevalence estimate the likelihood-based method relies directly on the quantitative test measures and their distribution for control and case sera therefore the reliability of the methods are expected to depend on the precision with which these distributions have been determined the precision depends on the number of control and case sera used in test validation to assess the required number of cases and controls that should be sampled to obtain precise test measure distributions and hence reliable estimates of the seroprevalence we simulated the validation of serological tests with various numbers of control and case sera see methods in brief test measures for control and case sera are drawn from true distributions subsequently the test measures are used to reconstruct the distribution of control and case test measures this reconstruction has its own uncertainty which should be included in the estimation of seroprevalence we find that we require at least 150 control and case sera to obtain sufficiently reliable seroprevalence estimates fig 4  clearly the number of required samples decreases when the accuracy of the test measured by auc-roc increases for a true prevalence of 8 as is used in fig 4 and a auc-roc value of 09 a high number of samples is needed to obtain a small confidence band around the estimate however for a auc-roc value of 095 sampling 150 cases and controls would be sufficient in this analysis we have focused on the point estimates and their variation as a proxy for the reliability of seroprevalence estimation as we mentioned above the variation in point-estimates is strongly correlated with the variation in bootstrap estimates of a single point-estimate see fig s3  thus our results on the variation of the point estimates apply equally to the confidence intervals how can we incorporate the precision with which the test measure distributions have been determined into a confidence interval of the seroprevalence we suggest a two-step bootstrap procedure first we resample the test measures of control and case sera and use the resampled dataset to obtain bootstrap estimates of the parameters of the test measure distributions second we resample the test measures of the serosurvey and using the bootstrap estimate of the control and case distributions of test measures obtain bootstrap estimates of the seroprevalence this procedure makes sure that the uncertainties arising from the lack of test accuracy as well as the lack of precision in the test measure distributions are appropriately accounted for in the estimation of the seroprevalence alternatively a one-step bayesian procedure can be used that estimates the parameters of the control and case sera distributions as well as the seroprevalence at once by combining the various likelihoods for these processes we provide an r-function for both the two-step and the one-step procedure we propose in the supplementary r-package the reliance of the likelihood-based method on quantitative test data allows us to investigate inconsistencies between the populations used for validating the test on the one hand and the population recruited into the serosurvey on the other for example assume that the serological test has been validated only with sera from individuals who underwent a severe infection in addition to sera from controls can we adopt the likelihood framework to detect the presence of individuals who underwent a mild infection with a distribution of test measures different from severe cases could we even estimate their seroprevalence to investigate this question we set up a simulation assuming three distributions of test measures corresponding to severe and mild cases and controls we further assume that the total seroprevalence is 10 of which 14 were severe infections consistent with observations at the beginning of the covid-19 epidemic in china 21  we then simulate a serosurvey with 10000 individuals that results in quantitative test measures randomly drawn from these three distribution according to their seroprevalences we then analyse the simulated serosurvey data assuming a likelihood based on quantitative test measure of only severe cases and controls this model misspecification reflects a scenario in which a large fraction of the infected population has been neglected for test validation as expected this analysis underestimates the true seroprevalence see fig 5 a  the misspecified likelihood however is valuable as a null model against which more complex likelihood can be tested to test for the presence of mild cases in the serosurvey we analyse the simulated serosurvey data with a likelihood that extends the misspecified two-distribution likelihood by an additional unknown distribution of test measures in mild cases a likelihood ratio test can then be used to identify the existence of this population of mild cases even though it was ignored during test validation this procedure is generic and does not require that the ignored cases be mild it can detect any type of cases as long as their test measure distribution differs from those included in the test validation lastly the fit of the three-distribution likelihood yields estimates for the seroprevalences of mild and severe cases and the mean and variance of the test measure distribution of mild cases this analysiswithout knowledge of the third distribution -succeeds in estimating the total seroprevalence without bias fig 5 a  it also yields estimates for the seroprevalences for mild and severe cases separately fig 5 b  the identifiability of the individual seroprevalences depends strongly on how distinct the test measure distributions of mild and severe cases and the controls are in this study we analyze a likelihood-based method proposed before for various other viruses that allows the unbiased estimation of seroprevalence in a population 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  the method relies on the quantitative serological test measurements before they have been dichotomized ie categorized as positive or negative using a cutoff we confirm the well-known fact that such a dichotomization leads to strong biases in the estimate of seroprevalence and its time trends when estimates are not corrected for the sensitivity and specificity of the serological test 8  even though the commonly used rogan-gladen and bayesian corrections alleviate the biases the estimates of the seroprevalence are generally less reliable than they could be estimates with the rogan-gladen correction can even be negative for low test accuracies and for the low seroprevalences that we expect in the current coronavirus pandemic we show that the likelihood-based method corrects the biases in a way that leads to less variable estimates it is also applicable through the entire range of test accuracies and seroprevalences and should therefore be of value specifically for covid-19 serosurveys as inputs the likelihood function accepts any common type of quantitative test measures of specific antibody levels such as optical densities or arbitrary units in elisas or neutralization titers that inhibit viral replication to any degree specified eg nt50 or nt90 in neutralization assays it is not essential that these measures are linearly correlated with the level of antibodies it is important however that the isotype units and scales are the same as those for the test measure distributions of control and case sera while the likelihood-based method has been developed to increase the reliability of seroprevalence estimates especially for tests with low accuracy it also works for perfect tests also in this case a definition of a cutoff discriminating test measures into seropositives and negatives is not necessary for estimating the seroprevalence with the likelihood-based method paired with the simulation of serosurveys the likelihood-based method can provide guidance on the design of serosurveys while we find that a low test accuracy can be compensated by higher sample sizes in a serosurvey the increase in required sample size can be large see fig 3  thus investing in test refinement should be carefully weighed against the additional overhead of a larger study the likelihood-based method may open up avenues for serosurveys in low and middle income countries in cases when highly accurate and therefore expensive serological tests are not available because the likelihood-based method relies directly on the quantitative test measures it provides better insights into how the precision with which the test accuracy has been determined affects the estimates of seroprevalence we show that for the expected current seroprevalence of the coronavirus pandemic and an optimistically high test accuracy of auc-roc 095 approximately 150 control and case sera are required to adequately determine the distribution of their test measures that ensure for sufficiently reliable estimates of a seroprevalence again the effort put into test refinement should be carefully weighed against the effort put into mapping the test accuracy thoroughly additionally we provide a procedure to calculate a confidence interval of the estimated seroprevalence that appropriately accounts for the uncertainties arising from the lack of test accuracy as well as the lack of precision in the test measure distributions similar to the cutoff-based methods it has been shown the likelihood-based method can be easily extended by categorical or continuous covariates of the seroprevalence such as sex or age 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  also temporal changes in seroprevalence -as predicted for example by epidemiological models -can be incorporated into this framework the likelihood-based method provides a more natural approach to integrating multiple test measures such as iga and igg levels in cutoff-based methods this may require complex cutoff functions that depend on the multiple measures and will complicate the determination of sensitivity and specificity the likelihood-based method relies on unbiased data from cases unbiased means this cohort should contain individuals who have undergone severe and mild infections and the proportions of the infections with different severities should recapitulate the proportions in the population we have illustrated that an over-representation of severe cases compared to mild cases in the validation of the serological test leads to underestimation of the total seroprevalence fig 5  thus it is preferable to include cases detected by contact tracing rather than by more biased detection channels such as hospitalisation this requirement however applies generally to the adequate determination of test sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to determine cutoffs or to apply methods that use post-hoc corrections unlike the cutoff-based methods however a method based on the quantitative test measures allows us to infer the presence of cases that were not used for the validation of the test to this end the likelihood needs to be extended by an unknown distribution of test measures in addition to being able to identify a discrepancy of test validation versus serosurvey data this extended likelihood also allows for the estimation of the seroprevalence of the subpopulation with the unknown distribution fig 5  this issue is crucial for a reliable estimation of the true extent of the current covid-19 pandemic and still unknown the likelihood can be easily extended to include more than two types of cases we recommend to always fit a likelihood with an additional unknown distribution and to test its fit against a null likelihood that includes all known case distributions this guards against strong biases arising from neglecting a large fraction with distinct test measure distributions this work as well as other similar studies that investigate the effect of test accuracy on estimating seroprevalence 12  highlight the necessity of integrating the development of serological tests with the design of the serosurveys in which they will be applied this is especially relevant during the current coronavirus pandemic as the serological tests are developed at the same time as the serosurveys are being conducted the likelihood the likelihood-based approach to inference relies directly on the quantitative measure obtained from serological tests 14 15 16 17  it estimates the seroprevalence  by maximizing the likelihood of observing those quantitative test measures given their distribution for case and control sera see fig 6a  the likelihood for the data is shown in eq 1 here u is a vector with the quantitative test measures of all n tests  is a binary vector of length n with their underlying true serological status 1 for infected and 0 for not infected the probabilities pu i  i  1 and pu i  i  0 capture the distributions of quantitative test measures of control and case sera and p i  1 and p i  0 denote the probability of sampling individuals who have been truly infected or not the units of u can be anything that is commonly used in serological tests such as optical densities obtained from elisas or neutralization titers obtained in neutralization assays cutoff-based methods most commonly the quantitative test measures are dichotomized into seropositives and negatives using a cutoff there are many ways to estimate a cutoff value for a test 22 23  one strategy is to set the cutoff such that the test is highly specific 99 see fig 6c  this is equivalent to minimizing the number of false positives this will go at the cost of the sensitivity and will lead to more false negatives this method is referred to as the high specificity method another method that is often used to determine the cutoff is to maximize the youden index youden index  sensitivity  specificity -1 24  see fig 6c  graphically this is equivalent to maximizing the distance between the diagonal and the receiver-operator characteristic roc curve see fig 6d  this method is referred to as the max youden method the standard rogan-gladen correction of the binomial seroprevalence estimate q is 8  here r is the sensitivity and s the specificity of the test and  is the corrected estimator of seroprevalence effectively this correction adds the expected number of false negative and subtracts the expected number of false positives from the number of observed positives the correction works best when the expected number of false positives is smaller than the observed number of positives we apply this correction to the maximal youden and the high specificity method an alternative way to correct for the sensitivity and specificity is described by larremore et al 2020  they use a bayesian approach that samples from a posterior distribution that includes the estimates of the sensitivity and specificity 12  we also apply this correction to both the maximal youden and the high specificity method simulations we simulate serosurveys by assuming a given prevalence and distributions of the quantitative test measures for control and case sera for each virtual individual enrolled in these in silico serosurveys we conduct a bernoulli trial with the probability set to the true seroprevalence in a second step we simulate the serological test of each individual to this end we draw a random quantitative test measure from the distribution of either case or control sera -depending on whether the individual is truly seropositive or not to simulate serological tests with various accuracy we use several distributions of quantitative test measures for the case sera we assume the distribution of quantitative test measures for the control sera to be -distributed with a shape and scale parameter of 1 which results in a mean of 1 and the distribution for case sera to be -distributed with varying means and a rate parameter of 1 the scale parameter of the distribution for case sera determines the amount of overlap between the quantitative test measure of cases with controls and thus modifies accuracy fig 6  the results of these simulated serosurveys are then analyzed with the likelihood-and the various cutoff-based methods power analysis to estimate the statistical power of a serosurvey we conducted 500 serosurveys for each given test accuracy and sample size here the power is determined as the proportion of simulations for which the seroprevalence is estimated successfully we define an estimate to be successful when it deviates less than 25 from the true seroprevalence and the true seroprevalence is within 2 standard deviations of the estimate inferring the distribution of quantitative test measures for control and case sera to capture the uncertainty in the distribution of quantitative test measures we simulated experiments that aim to determine them we assume true distributions as specified above we then draw quantitative test measures for a given number of controls and cases from these true distributions from these in silico data we estimate the parameters of the distribution for control and case sera hereby we assume that distribution of the measures for control and case sera are -distributed and we estimate the shape and scale parameter of the distribution of the case sera and the scale parameter of the distribution of the control sera these estimated distributions are then used to analyse the simulated data incorporating distinct distributions for mild and severe case sera eq 3 represents a likelihood that allows for the possibility that there are various types of case sera with distinguishable distristributions see fig s1 19  for the sake of simplicity we assume that there are two types of case sera those from individuals who underwent a severe infection severe cases and those from individuals who underwent a mild infection mild cases log p i  2 s   m  pu i  i  2  p i  1 m  pu i  i  1  p i  0 s   m  pu i  i  0 3 compared to eq 1  i is now a categorical value that represents whether an individuals is seronegative 0 seropositive due to a mild infection 1 or seropositive due to a severe infection 2   mild is the seroprevalence of mild infections and  s the seroprevalence of severe infections this likelihood is formally equivalent to the one presented in van boven et al 19  without the age-structure we used the extended likelihood to estimate the total seroprevalence the seroprevalence of mild cases and the shape parameter of the distribution of quantitative test measures of the mild case sera the identifiability and confidence of the estimates of these three parameters depends on the amount of overlap between the distribution of the mild and severe case sera and the overlap between those and the control case sera in our simulations we hold the area under the roc-curve between the control and severe case sera constant at a level of 095 while we vary the area under the roc curve between the mild and severe case sera we set the mean of the distribution of mild cases always to a lower value than that of the severe cases see fig s1  both these means are larger than 1 which is the mean of the distribution of test measures for control sera we use a scale parameter of 1 for both distributions implementation the likelihood function for estimating seroprevalence as well as the simulations were implemented in the r language for statistical computing 25  the bayesian correction is executed with the metrop function in the mcmc package in r 26  with the number of batches equal to 10000 and the length of each batch equal to 100 an r-package containing the code is provided as supplementary material figure s3  the deviation from the mean seroprevalence estimate for bootstrapping or re-simulating the serosurvey for both cutoff-based and the

tested using mn assay as described previously park et al 2015 perera et al 2013 serology for bcov and ecov was carried out with culture medium without foetal calf serum known positive and negative control sera were included in all serology assays crossreactive responses in the merscov ppnt bcov mn and ecov mn assays were assessed using a panel of previously characterized immune or hyperimmune reference antisera generated against alpha beta and gamma coronaviruses these sera were either obtained from bei resources animal cov reagents supplied to bei by dr linda saif httpwwwbeiresourcesorgaboutbeiresourcesaspx or kindly provided by dr linda saif or dr stanley perlman equine sera known to be seropositive to ecov were provided by dr nicola pusterla department of veterinary medicine and epidemiology school of veterinary medicine university of california davis ca usa the homologous antibody titres to the immunized virus were also obtained where available from the providers of these respective antisera the serum panel for alpha coronavirus included sera generated against porcine respiratory coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus canine enteric coronavirus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus sera produced against mouse hepatitis virus strains jhm and a59 sars coronavirus bcov ecov represented the betacoronavirus group furthermore an immune serum for infectious bronchitis virus was used as representative for the gammacoronavirus group all these reference sera as well as additional ecov immune sera and merscovnegative camel sera were tested in ppnt or mn assays in parallel against merscov bcov as well as ecov to assess possible crossreactive antibody responses among these three coronaviruses some of these reference sera with the exception of horse and camel sera had been previously tested against merscov and bcov and the results were reported by us hemida et al 2014 all nasal and rectal swabs were tested using the pancoronavirus nested rtpcr assay ecov and merscov upe gene rtqpcr assays all swabs were negative in the merscov rtqpcr assay five rectal swabs 5315 were positive for coronavirus rna by the pancoronavirus assay tables 1 and 2 sequencing of the 440 base pair nucleotide fragment from the rdrp gene confirmed four of these to be ecov and the other to be dromedary camel hku23like virus designated as equine hku23 cov sa1354 additional sequence was obtained from these specimens to generate a nucleotide sequence of 933 nucleotides position 14780 to 15712 of ecov strain nc99 which was used for analysis of nucleotide differences in comparison with other coronaviruses genbank accession numbers ky458228ky458232 table 3 and phylogenetic analysis which confirmed the identification of the coronaviruses to be ecov and hku23 respectively figure 1 this result led to the testing of 306 nasal and 315 rectal swab specimens by specific rtqpcr assays for ecov and rtqpcr assay for hku23 testing by the ecov specific rtqpcr led to the detection of five rectal swabs specimens four of which had been detected by the pancoronavirus rtpcr assay as well as an additional positive rectal swab ct value 363 from a horse in the riyadh area table 2 using the hku23specific rtqpcr two positives were detected including sa1354 identified as hku23 by sequencing the pancoronavirus rtpcr assay amplicon and an additional positive result with a high ct value of 376 from a nasal swab sample none of the other nasal swabs had evidence of coronavirus rna compared to the pancoronavirus assay the specific ecov and hku23specific assays detected one additional specimen that was weakly positive for each of these viruses table 2 the five pancoronavirus pcr covpositive specimens had ct ranging from 294 to 359 in either the ecov or hku23 specific assays the pancoronavirus rtpcr was not sensitive at detecting specimens with ct higher than 36 in the ecov or hku23 assays however the results do demonstrate the importance of using the pancoronavirus assay when investigating coronavirus activity in animal species in new geographic areas our initial focus was to explore for evidence of merscov infections in horses in saudi arabia and oman none of the rectal swabs were positive for merscov rna but the application of the pancoronavirus rtpcr to these specimens revealed the presence of two other coronaviruses infecting horses in this region that is ecov and hku23 all seven horses from whom ecov or hku23 were detected were apparently healthy the specimens positive for ecov rna all came from different horses at a horse breeding facility in riyadh the two horses positive for hku23 rna were from dammam and qateef saudi arabia where horses were used for farming and in dammam also for breeding tables 1 and 2 in both cases these horses frequently came into contact with camels and other domestic livestock hku23 coronavirus is known to be endemic in camels woo et al 2014 we investigated for serologic evidence of merscov infections in the 243 horse sera using ppnt screening followed by endpoint titrations any sera positive at a screening reciprocal antibody titre of 20 in ppnt were confirmed using mn assay and prnt assay using live merscov strain emc possible serologic crossreactions with ecov and bcov were evaluated in mn assays which are the most specific serological assays available of the 243 sera tested only five 2 had detectable merscov antibody in the mersppnt assay at a screening titre of 20 four of these were from saudi arabia and one was from oman the endpoint mersppnt titres of these five sera ranged from 40 to 160 but only serum 92 which had the highest mersppnt titre was positive in the merscov mn test titre 20 table 4 in the confirmatory prnt which is considered the gold standard serological test for merscov horse serum 92 reduced plaque numbers by 90 prnt90 up to a titre of 40 this serum was negative in ecov and bcov mn assays table 4 this serum was from a racing horse stable in alqassem and may represent a rare example of transmission of merscov to horses or crossreaction with another yet undocumented coronavirus infecting horses this horse was not known to frequently come into contact with camels three of the other sera serum id nos 535 541 212 positive in the merscov ppnt assay had detectable ecov mn antibody and one of these also had detectable bcov mn antibody table 4 thus these may well represent evidence of crossreactive responses the extent of the serological crossreactivity of merscov ecov and bcov was systematically investigated we did not have an isolate of hku23 virus available for serological testing and bcov was used as a virus that is genetically closely related to hku23 with pairwise amino acid similarity of 941 in the spike protein gene the determinant of antigenic crossreaction in neutralization tests woo et al 2014 horse sera obtained from the usa reported to be strongly reactive by elisa optical density ranging from 1458 to 1939 for ecov showed high titre 1280 for ecov in mn assay as expected but also had high antibody titres ranging from 160 to 1280 in bcov mn tests table 5 as these horse sera were from horses in the field they may well have been exposed to multiple coronaviruses thus these results may reflect crossreactivity or coinfection of us horses with ecov and bcovlike viruses two of these sera showed low titres 20 in the merscov ppnt assay but were negative in the more stringent merscov mn assay as merscov is not circulating in the usa these results suggest crossreactivity between merscov and ecov or related covs may occur albeit at low titre similarly a bcov immune serum from an experimentally infected gnotobiotic calf showed detectable but 16fold reduced antibody titre with ecov but no crossreaction with merscov spike proteins of equine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus have an overall amino acid similarity of 808 and 731 similarity of the s1 region which contains the receptorbinding domain and neutralization epitopes this probably explains the large difference in neutralization titres observed in table 5 a dromedary serum from kazakhstan a region known to be free of merscov activity miguel et al 2016 had detectable antibody to bcov probably reflecting hku23 or bcov infection and also to ecov we cannot conclude whether this reflects crossreactivity or infection with bcov hku23 andor ecov none of the beta coronavirus immune sera to sarscov or mouse hepatitis virus nor immune sera to alpha or gamma coronaviruses gave crossreactions in bcov or ecov mn assays table 5 as had been previously reported none of these dromedary sera crossreacted with merscov hemida et al 2014 fiftyfour horse sera from saudi arabia and oman were selected to represent different collection locations excluding those five sera previously reported to be merscov ppnt positive table 6 these sera were seronegative for merscov as expected 40 74 of them had detectable mn antibody to ecov titres ranging from 20 to 640 median 40 and 18 333 had mn antibodies to bcov titres ranging from 20 to 160 median 20 the reciprocal geometric mean antibody titres assigning sera with titres 20 the value of 10 for computational purposes for ecov and bcov were 44 and 255 respectively there were twentyfour sera with undetectable antibody to bcov with detectable ecov antibody titres ranging from 20 to 640 the titres to ecov were higher than or equal to titres to bcov with two exceptions where the titre to bcov 20 was marginally higher than that with ecov table 6 these results are compatible with the rtpcr detection of ecov in rectal swabs in horses and probably suggest that ecov or a closely related virus is commonly infecting horses in many regions of the arabian peninsula two of the five horses in whom ecov rna was detected by rtqpcr had low ecov mn antibody titres 20 while the other three had titres ranging from 160 to 640 table 6 this may reflect virus shedding persists into convalescence or that reinfection of previously seropositive horses can occur the rtqpcr detection of two hku23like viruses indicates that hku23 which is common in dromedaries in the region is also infecting horses in the absence of an hku23 isolate for use in neutralization tests and given the potential serological crossreactivity between these three viruses it is difficult to conclude how commonly equines are infected with hku23 the antibody titres to bcov which is genetically closely related to hku23 in the spike protein gene may suggest that bcov or hku23like virus infection of horses does occur in saudi arabia the serological evidence of one of the 243 sera with detectable merscov antibody titres in the prnt90 test raises the question whether merscov may occasionally cross species to horses this serum did not have any detectable antibody to ecov or bcov however it is not possible to exclude the possibility that this observation reflects crossreaction with ecov bcov or other yet unknown coronaviruses confirmation of natural infection of horses with merscov can only come from detection of merscov rna in horse specimens recent experimental infection of horses with merscov did not result in virus replication or seroconversion adney et al 2016 in conclusion the serological data suggest that lineage a betacoronaviruses are commonly infecting horses in saudi arabia and oman but antibody crossreactions between these viruses do not permit us to use serological data alone to identify which coronaviruses are causing these infections rtpcr detection of ecov and hku23 in equine swabs confirms the circulation of these two viruses in horses in saudi arabia cocirculation of related viruses may provide potential for recombination a potential means of generating genetic diversity and facilitating host jumps in coronaviruses this is the first report of hku23 being detected in horses and the first detection of ecov

those reported by manufacturers timing of specimen collection relative to onset of illness or infection is crucial in the reporting of performance characteristics for covid-19 serological assays the optimal algorithm for implementing serological testing for covid-19 remains to be determined particularly in low-prevalence settings  the coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a global public health emergency on an unprecedented scale first reports in late december 2019 described a cluster of patients with pneumonia linked to a live animal market in wuhan china 1 2 3  one of the fundamental pillars in the prevention and control of covid-19 is timely scalable and accurate diagnostic testing diagnostic testing plays a critical role in defining the epidemiology of the disease informing case and contact management and ultimately in reducing viral transmission 4  to date testing has comprised detection of sars-cov-2 virus using reverse-transcriptase pcr rt-pcr assays predominantly from patients meeting specific epidemiological criteria however the immense scale of rt-pcr diagnostic testing has placed extraordinary demands on laboratories with challenges relating to supply chains of swabs laboratory reagents and the human and financial resource required to support population-level testing over the past two months there has been rapid development of serological assays for covid-19 in a number of countries 5  serological tests rely on detection of specific anti-viral antibodies igm igg iga or total antibody in patient serum plasma or whole blood the broad array of serological tests now available vary both in analytical performance and in their particular utility in the overall public health response to covid-19 the most publicised serological tests for covid-19 have been lateral flow immunoassays also known as serological point of care tests poct which have been manufactured and deployed in several countries most available poct involve detection of anti-sars-cov-2 igm or igg antibodies through binding to immobilised antigen generally domains of the spike s protein attached to colloidal gold followed by detection of the conjugates by an antihuman igm or igg antibody in addition a control line is usually also included in the assay which helps determine whether the test result is valid the relatively cheap and simple nature of lateral flow assays means that production is suited to scaling-up for increased testing capacity in many countries including the united states and australia the rapid development and implementation of covid-19 diagnostics has meant that normally stringent regulatory criteria have not been applied to all tests with limited published data

assessed the performance characteristics of five serological poct one commercial elisa and one commercial novel surrogate virus neutralisation test against a large serum panel from a cohort of over 100 patients with rt-pcr confirmed sars-cov-2 in keeping with other studies 9  the sensitivity of all assays was low  70 when all sample collection time points were considered however as expected given the reported antibody response to sars-cov-2 infection sensitivity increased considerably when samples collected 14 days post-symptom onset were assessed 10 with the majority achieving sensitivities over 90 our findings provide further support for recent commentary suggesting that current serological assays have limited if any role in the diagnosis of acute covid-19 with rt-pcr remaining the gold standard for diagnosis in the acute setting 11 12  specificities for poct ranged from 924-100 it is possible this may reflect differences in the antigens used in each assay although specific information about the sars-cov-2 recombinant antigen used in the assay was not described for most poct in keeping with previous reports 13 14  when both iga and igg components of the elisa were considered specificity was low 728 but considering igg alone specificity increased to 978 this study is one of the first to utilise a recently described svnt assay 7  previous work describing the development of this assay reported a 95-100 sensitivity and 100 specificity using cohorts in singapore and china 7 in our cohort at  14 days post symptom onset we achieved sensitivity of 912 95 ci 818-967 and specificity of 944 95ci 892-975 although limited clinical data are available on the cohort used to develop and validate the assay 7 it is possible that our relatively mild clinical cohort may generate lower antibody titres than a more severely unwell cohort potentially influencing sensitivity of the assay 10 15 of note the majority of our non-specific false positive samples in the svnt assay recorded inhibition just over the 20 cut-off however specificity improved when either i a higher inhibition cut-off was used or ii samples within an arbitrary range based on the ifu reported cv of the assay were tested in triplicate it is possible that populations of different ethnic background or geographic specific cut-offs may be required for the svnt assay as suggested by the kit provider in our low-prevalence setting where the test is more likely to act as a confirmatory assay raising the inhibition cut-off to 25 increased the specificity to 993 95 ci 961-999 thus improving clinical utility alternatively introduction of an equivocal range for the assay with repeat testing for samples within this range would be another approach to mitigate potential assay variation in

donors or vaccines however in order to appropriately deploy serological testing it is critical to understand the limitations of test performance in the epidemiological context in which tests are used this is particularly important in a setting such as australia which based on the number of reported cases of covid-19 7060 cases as of 18th may 2020 has an estimated covid-19 period prevalence of 003 16  as such even with highly sensitive and specific serological tests the majority of positive results are likely to represent false positives when considering the use of serology to inform policies relating to relaxing of physical distancing interventions specificity of the assay becomes critical if the majority of those identified as immune are actually false positive results then the threshold to maintain immunity within the community will not be achieved 17  analogous to hiv testing in low-prevalence settings 18  serological testing for sars-cov-2 may require a two-step approach whereby a sensitive high-throughput screening assay is followed by a high specificity assay for confirmation eg neutralisation testing or western blot this approach could facilitate seroepidemiological studies in low-prevalence settings which are required to better understand the extent of covid-19 infection at a population-level ongoing questions remain however about the duration and type of antibody response to sars-cov-2 particularly around the protective effect of neutralising antibodies against future re-infection 10  accordingly the concept of an immunity passport that facilitates return to workplaces or school should be interpreted with caution and the world health organization who currently recommends the use of poct immunodiagnostic assays in research settings only and not for clinical decision making until further evidence is available 19 a key strength of this study was our systematic collection of convalescent samples by establishing a community collection platform we tested over 50 patients who were more than 21 days postsymptom onset ideally validation of serological assays should be performed against a testing panel that includes samples from i patients at acute and convalescent stages of infection to assess sensitivity and ii patients with other human coronavirus infections to assess specificity given the range of serological assays now available there is a critical need for standardised protocols including reference standards across laboratories when conducting evaluations of emerging serological assays in summary our data describe the performance characteristics of five poct devices a commercially available elisa assay and a newly developed surrogate virus neutralisation test overall our findings are in keeping with recent position statements that note that serological assays have limited if any role in the diagnosis of acute covid-19 infection our data strongly suggest that current poct devices should not be used in the diagnosis of acute

doi medrxiv preprint   the aetiology origins and diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome llm poon y guan jm nicholls ky yuen jsm peiris   on march 18 2003 who initiated a virtual network of laboratories to investigate the cause of sars16 daily teleconferences updated members of the network on the progress of laboratory investigations in different parts of the world on patients with suspected sars16 this investigation established that influenza and other common respiratory pathogens were not the cause of this novel disease syndrome strategies for the detection of a novel agent included the use of direct electron microscopy on respiratory specimens bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue obtained from lung biopsy or necropsy culture in cell lines known to support respiratory viral infection and subsequently on other types of cells pcr and reverse-transcription pcr rt-pcr with consensus primers for respiratory viral pathogens and random-primer rt-pcr methods serology was used for the detection of agents antigenically related to known respiratory pathogens one of the problems faced in this investigation was the differentiation of sars from more routine causes of atypical pneumonia the one feature supporting the probable diagnosis of sars was epidemiological linkage to a cluster of similar disease cases substantial numbers of such cases were initially present in guangzhou at the hospital outbreaks at hanoi and at the prince of wales hospital hong kong and subsequently in toronto and singapore through global case notification a suspected case from singapore was also intercepted on a flight arriving in frankfurt germany17
 members of the network reported virus-like particles in clinical respiratory specimens by electron microscopy and these virus particles had pleomorphic morphology compatible with paramyxoviruses16 17 shortly after human metapneumovirus was detected in the respiratory tract of patients with sars at the prince of wales hospital in hong kong and in toronto18 19 however human metapneumovirus was not consistently detected in other patients with sars in hong kong outside the prince of wales hospital or elsewhere globally in addition the genetic sequence of the human metapneumovirus isolated from these patients was essentially similar to that previously known to circulate in human beings as such it was difficult to explain why human metapneumovirus which was known to have been a human pathogen for many years would cause a novel and unusual disease syndrome such as sars rhinovirus and chlamydia were also detected in patients with suspected sars10 17 20
 three laboratories within the who network independently reported the isolation of a novel coronavirus from clinical specimens of patients with sars14 17 20 in all three laboratories the strategies that led to the detection of this novel coronavirus were broadly similar although culture in cell lines including hep-2 mrc-5 mdck llc-mk2 hela rde nci-h292 hut-292 b95-8 and a549 that were usually used to culture respiratory viruses proved unproductive the virus was isolated in vero-e6 cells in two laboratories and frhk-4 cells in the other even before the nature of the virus was identified a link with sars was established by showing that serum samples from patients with suspected sars had increasing antibody titres to virus-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay iifa the identification of the agent as a coronavirus was made using thin-section electron microscopy of virus-infected cells and negatively stained preparations of cell-culture supernatants that were virus infected figure 1
 independent confirmation of the identity of the virus was obtained by sequencing fragments of the viral genome derived through random-primed rt-pcr in two laboratories and the use of consensus primers for coronaviruses in the other laboratory in all three laboratories the region that yielded the early sequence information was the open reading frame orf 1b region of the replicase gene possibly because this is a highly conserved region of the virus dna array analysis using a microarray containing probes for various virus families21 was done on infected and uninfected cells this analysis gave positive signals for a group of eight oligonucleotides whose sequence was derived from two virus families the coronaviridae and the astroviridae20 however microarray analysis could only be done once the virus was isolated in culture and could not be done directly on the clinical specimen the independent detection by three laboratories of a coronavirus-like agent in samples from patients with sars-like disease in hong kong vietnam singapore and germany patient from singapore led particular credence to the significance of this observation however to conclusively establish a causal role for this novel coronavirus the virus had to be consistently found in the relevant clinical specimens from patients with the disease and not in healthy controls rt-pcr methods based on the initial genetic sequence of the virus replicase gene were designed and applied to detect viral rna in patients specimens the virus isolate was also used in iifas and eias to detect serological responses in acute and convalescent serum specimens with these approaches infection with the novel coronavirus subsequently named sars-associated coronavirus was detectable in 45 of 50 consecutive patients with clinically suspected sars in hong kong all 32 patients from whom paired serum samples were available had seroconverted to positive for sars coronavirus viral rna was not detectable by rt-pcr in healthy controls serum samples from 200 healthy blood donors in hong kong even though there was an outbreak of sars at the time did not have antibody that was reactive to cells infected with sars coronavirus in iifas14 a second study found evidence of sars coronavirus by rt-pcr or virus culture in 19 patients with sars from vietnam hong kong and singapore and nine patients from whom serum samples were available had increasing antibody titres to the virus20 furthermore 384 randomly selected serum samples from us blood donors had no reactivity to the sars coronavirus by eia20 a third study found all five patients with probable sars and three of 13 patients with suspected sars who originated from singapore and vietnam to have evidence of sars coronavirus rna by rt-pcr17 taken together these results indicated that the novel coronavirus was associated with sars and given the lack of serological reactivity in human beings suggested that it was probably recently introduced to the human population because on the basis of the partial genetic information available the virus seemed to be an agent not previously known to circulate in human populations the likely origin of the virus was from an animal source fulfilment of kochs postulates for establishing the cause of a disease requires that the microbe should be detected at the site of the disease sars coronavirus was detected in the lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage of a patient with sars by virus culture rt-pcr and electron microscopy10 17 20 in addition virus-like particles compatible in size and morphology to coronavirus were shown in lung biopsy tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage10 20 the lung pathology of fatal sars showed bronchial epithelial denudation loss of cilia type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and in patients who died later in the course of the disease syncytial cells were seen in the alveoli20 22 23 sars coronavirus rna was shown in the lungs by rt-pcr23 24 and in-situ hybridisation25 26 27 and viral antigen was detected in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages by immunohistology our unpublished data no evidence of human metapneumovirus was detected in the lungs by rt-pcr by electron microscopy or by a serological response in paired serum samples22 23
 the final requirement for the fulfilment of kochs postulates to establish the cause of an infectious disease is reproduction of the disease in a relevant animal model infection of cynomolgous macaques with an isolate of sars coronavirus led to disease that was pathologically similar to that seen in human patients with sars with epithelial necrosis serosanguinous alveolar exudates hyaline membranes type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and the presence of syncytia28 29 the virus was successfully re-isolated from these lesions and an antibody response to the virus was shown in the infected animals by contrast infection of macaques with human metapneumovirus produced a mild suppurative rhinitis with minimal erosion in the infected airways28 the possibility remained that co-infection with human metapneumovirus could exacerbate the disease caused by sars coronavirus however there was no evidence of human metapneumovirus infection by rt-pcr or serological methods in patients with severe and fatal sars sars coronavirus was detected in these patients which suggested that human metapneumovirus was not necessary for development of severe or fatal sars23 in addition infection of macaques with sars coronavirus followed by human metapneumovirus did not produce enhanced disease28 thus it was concluded that sars coronavirus was both necessary and sufficient to cause the full syndrome of sars subsequently it was shown that sars coronavirus infects and replicates in cats and ferrets and can be transmitted to uninfected animals30 recently sars coronavirus has also been shown to infect and replicate in mice although without overt disease31 these experiments provide alternative animal models for the investigation of sars of these the macaque and ferret models show clinically significant disease within weeks of the isolation of the novel coronavirus associated with sars the full genome of the virus was sequenced32 33 analysis of the genome of the sars coronavirus confirmed that it was completely novel across the whole of its length and was not derived by recombination between previously known animal or human coronaviruses this finding also confirmed that sars coronavirus could not have been artificially generated in the laboratory as a bioterrorist agent coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single positive-stranded rna genome all coronaviruses have five major orfs that encode the replicase spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins34 35 these viruses can be subdivided into three groups on the basis of antigenic and genetic studies all previously known human coronaviruses can be classified into group 1 eg 229e and group 2 eg oc43 sars coronavirus showed some serological cross-reactivity with antisera raised to human coronavirus 229e group 120 partial initial viral sequences of the viral replicase had indicated that sars coronavirus was genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses14 17 20 further characterisation of the full genome confirmed this deduction and suggested that the virus is distantly related to coronaviruses from groups 2 and 332 33 36 these findings prompted the conclusion that either the sars coronavirus represents a new fourth group within the coronavirus genus32 33 or that it represented a group 2 virus that had diverged from others in the group very early in evolution37 however unlike other group 2 viruses sars coronavirus does not contain a haemagglutinin-esterase protein encoding sequence further work is required to confirm the taxonomic classification of this virus the availability of the full genetic sequence has allowed refinement of diagnostic assays see below rational antiviral drug design and vaccine development38 39
 the recent introduction of a novel coronavirus in human beings without prior serological evidence of infection in the human population prompted much speculation about the origin of this virus whereas bioengineered or even extraterrestrial agents were adduced by some to explain its origin40 the most probable explanation was that it was an animal virus that had recently acquired the ability for human-human transmission this hypothesis was strengthened by reports that early patients with sars in guangdong were exposed to live wild game animals held in markets serving the restaurant trade for freshly cooked game meat5 7 a search for the animal source of the precursor virus was prompted figure 2
 sampling of several animal species found in one of the live-game markets in guangdong revealed that some of them carried a virus genetically and antigenically related to the human sars coronavirus41 in particular a sars-like coronavirus was detected by rt-pcr in the nasal and faecal swabs of civet cats paguma larvata and a raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides serological evidence of infection was found in these species and also in a chinese ferret-badger melogale moschata41 genetic sequencing of the virus revealed that the animal coronavirus had more than 99 homology with human sars coronavirus figure 3
 however when compared with the animal viruses the human sars coronavirus seemed to have a 29-nucleotide deletion in orf8 figure 4
 this additional sequence predicts that the animal virus will express a putative protein of 122 aminoacids that is not seen in the human sars coronavirus interestingly a subsequent study revealed other genotypes with similar deletions in the same orf42 in that study viruses with a 82-nucleotide deletion were isolated from the early phase of the epidemic in addition viruses with a 415-nucleotide deletion resulting in the loss of the whole orf8 region were found in may 2003 ie at the late phase of the outbreak these results indicated that the expression of orf8 is dispensable for the sars coronavirus in human beings alternatively it is also tempting to speculate that deletions in orf8 might give the virus an advantage to adaptation in human beings animal traders working with live animals in these markets had high seroprevalence for both the human and animal sars coronavirus although they did not have a history of sars-like disease41 43 the animal precursor of sars coronavirus is thus likely to be inefficient at infecting human beings and repeated exposure to the precursor animal virus probably leads to the abortive infection or antigenic stimulation that results in this observed serological response in the animal handlers these findings taken with the history of exposure to these same live-animal markets provided by some of the early patients with sars suggests that the live-animal markets were probably the site where the inter-species transfer of the animal virus to human beings occurred it seems that once the virus is introduced into such live-animal markets with a diverse fauna of small mammals the precursor sars coronavirus efficiently establishes itself in several small mammalian species studies with avian influenza viruses in live-poultry markets has shown that such viruses amplify within the setting of a market trading in live birds44 and it is likely that the precursor sars coronavirus does likewise in markets in which there is a diversity of mammalian species with animals being removed and added to the ecosystem on a regular basis45 however the reservoir of this virus in nature remains to be conclusively identified the palm civet or the raccoon dog are current candidates equally another species could be the reservoir of the virus in the wild while the civet cats and similar species serve as the amplifier of the disease in the setting of live-animal markets further work is required to identify the natural reservoir of this virus detailed molecular epidemiological investigations indicate that the viruses detected in human beings in the early stages of the sars outbreak in guangdong are closely related to the animal sars coronavirus41 42 46 some viruses had the additional 29-nucleotide sequence that was seen in the animal viruses the early viruses were found to be genetically more diverse and more prone to mutation than viruses isolated later in the course of the outbreak which suggests that the sars coronavirus was in the process of host adaptation and was subjected to a high selection pressure during the early phase of the outbreak42 later in the outbreak the virus had presumably become more adapted to human-human transmission and one lineage of the virus had become dominant for example in feb-march 2003 there were at least four introductions of sars coronavirus from china to hong kong46 these were genetically diverse however both classic and molecular epidemiology suggests that only one of these viruses seems to have given rise to the major outbreak in hong kong that subsequently spread globally thus most of the sars coronaviruses isolated from patients in canada vietnam and singapore are genetically closely related to the virus isolated from a single sars patient in hong kong hku-33 whereas other genetic lineages seem to be less transmissible42 46 47 48 49 50
 isolation of the causal agent and determination of its partial genome sequence provided the basis for the first generation of laboratory tests for sars14 17 20 rt-pcr tests were based on the orf1b sequence of sars coronavirus replicase gene the first part of the genome to be sequenced serological tests were based on the iifa of virus-infected cells and eias were based on viral cell extracts virus isolation was not very sensitive was labour intensive and took too long to be clinically relevant although these tests used in combination proved robust and useful for the retrospective diagnosis of sars they proved less satisfactory for providing a diagnosis in the first few days after disease onset51 52
 the first generation of rt-pcr assays were more sensitive at the end of the first week of illness with only 3565 of specimens testing positive in the first few days of the disease51 53 54 55 however these assays provided important insights into the pathogenesis and transmission of the disease virus was detected by rt-pcr and by culture not only in the respiratory tract but also in the faeces and urine51 replication of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed by electron microscopic studies of biopsies of the upper and lower intestinal mucosa in patients with sars56 these findings suggested that infection with sars coronavirus was disseminated and not simply confined to the respiratory tract they also raised the possibility that the infection could be spread by the faecal route this route proved to be important in at least one major community outbreak amoy gardens in hong kong in which over 300 patients were infected within the period of a few days presumably through contaminated faeces57 quantitative rt-pcr assays on the nasopharyngeal aspirates as well as rates of positivity of first-generation rt-pcr assays at different stages of the illness showed that unlike other respiratory viral infections viral load and rates of positivity of sars coronavirus in the upper respiratory tract increased progressively to peak at around day 10 after disease onset51 53 54 55 58 these findings provided the reason why rt-pcr assays were of poor sensitivity early in the course of the disease they also predicted that virus transmission would be lower in the first few days of illness a finding supported by epidemiological observations59 whereas viral rna could be detected by rt-pcr for many weeks or even months after the onset of disease virus culture was only possible during the first 3 weeks of illness51 it is possible that even though virus replication continues after the first 3 weeks of disease the virus may be complexed with antibody and therefore no longer infective or transmissible this finding was also in agreement with epidemiological findings apart from respiratory samples viral rna was also detected in stool blood cerebrospinal fluid and urine58 60 61 62 63 of these non-respiratory samples stool specimens had the highest proportion of positive rt-pcr results in one study 65 of 67 stool samples collected later in the illness mean 142 days were positive in conventional rt-pcr assays58 this observation agreed with the report that stool samples might be a good alternative to respiratory samples for the identification of sars patients55 however one study indicated that viral rna was not detectable in stool samples within the first 4 days of illness suggesting that stool samples might not be useful for early diagnosis of sars51
 the low sensitivity of conventional rt-pcr assays in the first few days of disease the period during which laboratory diagnosis is most relevant for patient care prompted the exploration of several strategies to improve test sensitivity a quantitative real-time rt-pcr approach was used to improve sensitivity as well as turnaround time64 65 these methods had the benefit of being closed systems that reduced the chance of pcr cross-contamination within the laboratory more importantly the technology when combined with automated specimen extraction methods had the potential to become high throughput assays a significant advantage in areas with outbreaks of sars in which large numbers of specimens had to be tested in addition these assays provided quantitative viral load data which helped elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease for example these assays showed that viral load was highest in specimens of the lower respiratory tract eg bronchoalveolar lavage sputum endotracheal aspirates and was higher in nasopharyngeal aspirate than in throat swabs17 faecal samples had very high viral loads toward the end of the first week of illness and were the specimen of choice during the second week of disease66
 other approaches were also used to enhance the detection rate of sars the sensitivity of detection could be increased by testing multiple serial samples collected from the same patient62 however this increased the already high workloads in clinical diagnostic laboratories real-time nested rt-pcr strategies were shown to be useful for detecting low copy numbers of sars coronavirus present in the early stage of illness67 68 the turnaround time for this method was much shorter than that for the conventional nested rt-pcr assay however nested rt-pcr increases the risk of laboratory cross-contamination leading to false-positive results69
 in infected cells coronaviruses generate subgenomic mrna for the synthesis of structural viral protein by discontinuous transcription because of the genomic organisation of sars coronavirus all subgenomic mrna molecules contain the nucleocapsid gene sequence region of the sars coronavirus32 33 thus targeting the nucleocapsid gene sequence should be expected to enhance sensitivity of diagnosis this proved to be the case when applied to specimens collected from experimentally infected macaques29 however several independent studies on clinical specimens from patients with sars proved otherwise66 70 71 72 and showed that most of the viral rna in clinical specimens is of genomic origin66 however it was advisable to have rt-pcr assays that target different parts of the viral genome to serve as a confirmation of the positive result73 this strategy provides some assurance that a positive result is not due to laboratory contamination with pcr amplicon given that the analytical sensitivity of rt-pcr assays could not be increased much further the only other option for enhancing test sensitivity was by increasing the amount of viral rna added to the rt-pcr reaction mix70 74 by extraction of rna samples from a larger volume of nasopharyngeal aspirate and by applying quantitative real-time rt-pcr technologies the sensitivity of sars-coronavirus detection improved to approximately 80 of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from day 13 of disease onset with 100 specificity75 this method was not necessarily associated with an increase in pcr inhibitors75 however this strategy implies that an inhibitor control is important to assure against a false-negative result due to pcr inhibition in initial studies serum or plasma were not thought to be useful for molecular diagnosis of sars17 62 however subsequent studies on plasma and serum samples from sars patients showed that sars coronavirus rna was detectable in more than 50 of plasma and 78 of serum samples during the first week of illness70 in another study which used multiple serial plasma samples 79 of sars patients within the first 3 days of illness could be identified by quantitative rt-pcr76 a recent study showed that sars coronavirus rna was detectable and was claimed to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a sars patient during early disease61 whether the viral rna originated from infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or by phagocytosis or endocytosis of virus replicating the respiratory tract is still unclear nevertheless blood leucocytes may provide yet another alternative for early sars diagnosis however sars coronavirus viraemia occurs mainly within the first week of the disease77 in addition outside the period of a sars epidemic most respiratory infections are caused by other pathogens and a respiratory specimen still remains the most important clinical specimen for clinical investigation according to the results of first-generation rt-pcr assays patients with a positive rt-pcr result on admission had worse outcomes in terms of survival requirement for intensive care and assisted ventilation when compared with sars patients with negative rt-pcr results at admission53 this finding was presumably a surrogate for viral load early in the disease recently this hypothesis has been confirmed using quantitative rt-pcr and high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality viral load from patients who died from the disease was recently shown to be about 45 log higher than in patients who eventually recovered from the illness78 a high viral load is also associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea78 and the requirement for intensive care70 thus quantitative pcr assays might provide critical prognostic information for clinical management in particular if the viral load is a major predictor of clinical outcome effective antiviral therapy that helps to reduce viral load is likely to provide clinical benefit serodiagnosis is currently the gold standard for confirmation of a diagnosis of sars iifa using virus-infected cells spotted onto teflon-coated microwell slides51 or eia based on extracts of virus-infected cells coated on microwell eia plates have proved reliable methods for the diagnosis of sars79 however seroconversion usually occurred in weeks 2 or 3 of illness and a few patients seroconverted as late as 28 days after disease onset58 thus serology is not an option for early diagnosis of the disease detection of igm or iga subclass-specific antibody did not allow earlier diagnosis58 80 these tests require culture of live sars coronavirus to provide the relevant antigen used in the assays and require reliable inactivation of virus infectivity before they can be used outside biohazard level 3 containment recombinant viral nucleoprotein and spike protein antigens expressed in escherichia coli and other substrates have been assessed as alternative serological test platforms79 81 82 these have the potential for providing low cost reproducible and non-hazardous serological tests in an eia format that is amenable to high throughput testing79 83 84 however it should be borne in mind that each antigen and assay format must be individually tested to assess the possibility of cross-reaction with other related human coronaviruses whereas such serological cross-reactions did not prove to be a major problem with the whole native viral antigen assays mentioned above this should not be assumed to mean that recombinant antigens are equally specific until they have been shown to be so furthermore although serological cross-reactivity proved not be a problem during the period of the sars outbreak in the post-sars era when the prior probability of sars is extremely low a positive serological result must be treated with even greater caution in addition to the two known human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 a new human coronavirus has been discovered85 the possibility of cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses although rare is real and must be taken seriously furthermore individuals vary in the antigenic epitopes to which they produce antibodies hence cross-reactivity may well be a rare event although such a result if not interpreted with care may have major implications for public health we therefore suggest that all positive serological results should be confirmed by neutralisation tests in reference laboratories in periods in which there are no outbreaks of sars clinical specimens for investigation of sars should be tested with particular care positive rt-pcr results should be confirmed by an independent molecular test on a different specimen rt-pcr tests for different genome targets eg replicase gene and nucleoprotein gene should be available in reference laboratories to confirm positive results and for selective use in confirming negative results on patients on whom there is a high degree of suspicion serial specimens from many sites eg respiratory faeces and serum should be tested in addition to avoid obtaining false-negative results assays with internal pcr inhibitor control should be encouraged positive results should be confirmed in an independent reference laboratory serological assays should show a significant rise in antibody titres to native viral antigens eg iifa and be confirmed by virus neutralisation human infection with an animal sars-like coronavirus which is what we are most likely to encounter may behave atypically compared with sars for example the clinical disease may be milder and the viral load may be even lower and more transient than with sars this means even greater vigilance may be required in making the diagnosis of a infection with the sars-related animal coronavirus possible options for the re-emergence of sars includes the undetected continued transmission of the virus from the outbreak in the summer of 2003 escape of the virus from laboratories that contain live sars coronavirus or the re-emergence of the virus from an animal reservoir there is at present no evidence for the virus persisting in the human population although the virus may be detected by rt-pcr in the faeces for months after the onset of disease51 virus isolation is rarely possible after the third week of illness and there is no evidence for disease transmission by patients in late convalescence the possibility that immunocompromised patients such as those with aids may harbour the virus long term has to be considered however if epidemiologically relevant transmission from such cases occurred sars should have been manifest by now given the intense global surveillance and awareness that now exists escape of the virus from a laboratory has indeed occurred on three occasions86 and highlights the importance of biosafety who has provided strict biohazard guidelines for the handling of this virus and its secure storage87 at least one of these events involved the handling of virus that was thought to be chemically inactivated86 88 thus researchers should use appropriate and internationally accepted methods for the inactivation of live viruses89 a detailed study on sars-coronavirus inactivation has been recently reported90 to prevent any inadvertent laboratory-acquired infection leading to secondary transmission in the community as happened after the laboratory infections in beijing88 a high level of alert for febrile and respiratory illness in all laboratory workers who handle infectious sars coronavirus needs to be maintained the re-emergence of the virus from its animal reservoir remains possible given that the virus is detectable in the faeces and respiratory secretions of small mammals within live-animal markets in southern china re-emergence in four patients with sars in guangdong in december 2003 and january 2004 and epidemiological genetic linkage to live-game markets and viruses isolated from them prompted the wholesale cull of civet cats and other small mammals in these markets in january 200491 no further human cases of sars acquired from animals have since been detected

  double-edged spike are sars-cov-2 serologic tests safe right now richard torres henry rinder m   validation of new immunologic tests aint easy its been said validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a particularly daunting task while we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic serologic testing for antibodies to sars-cov-2 has now come to the limelight sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on health care resources in the united states and many other countries specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion ie flatten the curve scientific experts governmental officials and other professionals have publicly advocated for sars-cov-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially reenter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus a test for detecting immune individuals who will not be reinfected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept but is it realistic the temporary easing of food and drug administration fda marketinguse regulations has enabled the rapid expansion of accurate fast and reliable nucleic acid tests to identify acute infection with sars-cov-2 laboratory professionals diagnostic companies suppliers investigators and hospital administrators have all stepped up to manage acute supply shortages for critical testing components including instruments test-compatible swabs and nucleic acid extraction kits ensuring continued availability of reliable and timely test results as we approach the peak of severe disease prevalence in several regions according to comprehensive models developed by epidemiologists and statisticians we now are faced with a new laboratory crisis sars-cov-2 antibody testing numerous antibody tests have recently become available serologic tests for antibodies to sars-cov-2 are typically based on lateral flow immunochromatography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa currently available tests predominantly target antibodies to 1 of 2 main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus  the nucleocapsid protein n and the spike protein s several assays focus on the s1 subunit of the spike protein which is somewhat specific to each coronavirus strain12 the s1 subunits host the binding domain for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is thought to be the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 gains entry into cells1 because the s1 subunit is highly immunogenic and its affinity for the ace2 receptor appears to correlate with infectivity1 it has been the target for sars-cov-2 serologic assays with reportedly high sensitivity and specificity23 clinical implementation urgently requires validation of these new assays since real-life performance data are scarce the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has been marked by an inspiring level of interlaboratory collaboration at yale-new haven hospital we are particularly grateful for invaluable discussions and sharing of data with johns hopkins massachusetts general hospital mount sinai nyu-langone cornellcolumbia arup mayo clinic and many others scientific journals have contributed via the rapid dissemination of curated studies and preprint sites offer additional information that can be scrutinized in a shorter time frame prior to dedicated reviewer analysis the accumulation and exchange of valuable laboratory evidence has increased our understanding of the serologic testing landscape in a short period of time as a result we now know that individuals with symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection will generally not have detectable antibodies to sars-cov-2 within the first 7 days of the onset of symptoms34 the majority of hospitalized sars-cov-2-infected individuals with confirmed viral rna will have detectable igg antibodies 14 days and more certainly 28 days after the onset of symptoms with assay sensitivity and specificity in the high 90 percents5 total antibody concentration appears to rise to detectable levels first igm and iga both rise 1 to 2 days earlier than igg3 unpublished observations preliminary data suggests older individuals produce more robust antibody responses assays differ in overall performance but several methods being validated by large laboratories appear comparable one might therefore ask what exactly is the problem as valuable as this information is it may be insufficient to support critical decisions that providers managers administrators and governmental agencies will face especially regarding immunity in individuals who have remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during the pandemic to determine whether an individual is immune to sars-cov-2 we must know the pretest probability in the specific population being tested as well as the sensitivity and specificity for protective antibodies of the assay a significant challenge is that to date serologic data are largely limited to hospitalized ill patients there is reason to suspect that serologic findings in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic exposures may not correlate as well as in hospitalized patients particularly as anecdotal evidence suggests individuals with low viral loads produce lower antibody titers unpublished data in addition assessment of antibody effectiveness is problematic even in seriously ill patients approximately one-third of sars-cov-2-infected patients who developed antibodies during hospitalization have been reported to lack antibodies that neutralize virus in plaque growth assays considered the standard laboratory test for antibody effectiveness6 this implies an individual with antibodies may not be immune to reinfection finally a positive antibody result in a potentially immune individual does not guarantee noninfectious status there may be continuing active viral shedding particularly if their antibodies are nonneutralizing the molecular heterogeneity of sars-cov-2 subtypes7 could also have an effect on the sensitivity and specificity of serologic assays the imperfect performance of comparable more established serologic tests for other diseases eg toxoplasma igm may be acceptable because we have a much better understanding of the clinical scenarios unfortunately the same confidence does not hold true for sars-cov-2 serologic testing quality will play a pivotal role in ensuring we are able to obtain the data required to understand covid-19 immunity some of the serologic tests currently available are simply bound to be inferior and that needs to be documented the united kingdom abandoned large-scale purchasing of test kits when the kits failed to satisfy minimum validation metrics8 predictably online direct-to-consumer tests are being aggressively marketed without any published information to evaluate their clinical performance9 while some antigenic targets have shown minimal cross-reactivity with the 4 prevalent non-sars-cov-2 coronaviruses2 without validation studies there is a real risk that some assays may simply reflect prior exposure to the common cold fortunately reputable commercial entities with experienced scientists sophisticated equipment and good manufacturing practices have begun to release serologic assays under fda guidance commercial assays typically undergo extensive prerelease standardization including testing for interferences and matrix effects quality control and test results in large patient cohorts this sets the stage for acquisition of clinical and epidemiologic data but concerns remain when proposals call for testing populations different from those used to validate the assay what if a health care worker hcw who had a fever and no other symptoms 14 days ago wants to return to work and tests positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies can we assume with high confidence that this hcw is both immune and noninfectious if we are wrong then we have placed patients and coworkers at risk a failed prevention is also likely to erode faith in the integrity of laboratory tests for the disease we have heard the argument that any testing is better than none providing a path to restoring normalcy and the lack of which has high ongoing societal costs as laboratory professionals we can only respond that for anti-sars-cov-2 serology 1 bad assays will always be counterproductive 2 good assays have not been proven in the proposed test population and 3 more experience is needed to help us properly interpret the serologic test results regulatory and health officials appear to recognize these limitations eg return to work guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention currently do not include serologic testing the role of serologic testing in identifying potential donors for convalescent plasma remains to be fully investigated as does the therapeutic benefit of such an intervention in this setting but other uses for serologic testing may emerge one such clinical scenario where sars-cov-2 serologic assays may be particularly useful is when a positive serology is accompanied by repeatedly negative nucleic acid testing in the setting of a highly suggestive clinical presentation serology may provide the basis for specific therapies for covid-19 infection still until we understand the patterns of antibody response to sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic individuals and the correlation of antibody response with susceptibility to reinfection it seems prudent to apply caution to the criteria used to frame economic social and corporate policy biological variability is the bane of clinical pathology in the setting of validation and clinical application of serologic testing this variability presents a daily struggle reputable diagnostic companies and both commercial and academic clinical laboratories have repeatedly demonstrated that the value of dedication to testing quality ensures clinical utility health industry manufacturing experts engineers quality and regulatory managers sales professionals scientists and physicians have been working diligently under significant duress during the covid-19 pandemic to the great benefit of society as laboratory medicine professionals we must now leverage these efforts by ensuring that 1 serologic tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies perform as well as intended and 2 we provide information that enables health care providers administrators and health officials to best interpret and apply the available evidence at this point in the evolution of serologic testing for sars-cov-2 we must say in unison caveat emptor  interklinisch transport van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen martin kneyber c   tot voor enkele jaren geleden bestond er slechts een beperkte voorziening voor het overplaatsen van ic-behoeftige kinderen naar een picu het interklinisch transport werd veelal verzorgd door de insturend kinderarts of in sommige gevallen door een anesthesioloog van het insturend ziekenhuis deze persoon had in de meeste gevallen weinig tot geen ervaring met het transport van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen3 daarnaast beschikte men tijdens het transport niet of onvoldoende over de juiste apparatuur uit nederlands onderzoek bleek dan ook dat het voor het kind beter was als het interklinisch transport plaats zou vinden door een transportteam van de picu waar het kind zou worden opgenomen4
 op grond van deze gegevens heeft de sectie intensive care kinderen van de nederlandse vereniging voor kindergeneeskunde een notitie opgesteld waarin de zorg voor ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen werd besproken5 deze notitie volgde op een beleidsnotitie met een soortgelijke strekking opgesteld door de inspectie voor de gezondheidszorg6 in beide notities werd gesproken over het transport van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen naar een picu dit leidde onder andere tot de afspraak om in 2006 een landelijk dekkend transportsysteem functionerend te hebben uit diverse onderzoeken uitgevoerd in australi het verenigd koninkrijk en de verenigde staten blijkt dat de kwaliteit van zorg tijdens een interklinisch transport groter is als het transport begeleid wordt door een picu-team hiervoor is een aantal verklaringen te geven ten eerste de ruimere ervaring en scholing in het herkennen en behandelen van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen evenals kennis van het voortschrijden van het ziekteproces beyond the golden hour ten tweede het gebruik van de trolley met eigen materialen en als derde een veel lagere frequentie aan complicaties zoals bijvoorbeeld accidentele detubatie of onvoldoende sedatie tijdens transport nu functioneert in een aantal regios in nederland een 24-uurs transportsysteem voor ernstig zieke of gewonde gentubeerde kinderen bij patinten bij wie geen noodzaak tot endotracheale intubatie bestaat wordt het transport door het insturende ziekenhuis verzorgd het voordeel van het 24-uurssysteem is dat insturend artsen niet meer hoeven te zoeken naar een beschikbaar picu-bed als zij een patint over willen plaatsen naar hun regionale picu wordt contact gezocht en wordt de overname gerealiseerd in het geval van een niet te realiseren opname zorgt het regionale centrum voor opname op een andere picu inclusief het transport naar deze afdeling de insturende specialist blijft verantwoordelijk voor de primaire opvang van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen in toenemende mate hebben kinderartsen maar ook anesthesiologen en seh-artsen van perifere ziekenhuizen met succes deelgenomen aan de advanced pediatric life support apls-cursussen waarin de opvang van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen op gestructureerde wijze eigen wordt gemaakt de insturende specialist heeft telefonisch overleg met de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist over de conditie van het kind en de indicatie tot endotracheale intubatie daarnaast kan de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist adviezen geven omtrent de verdere stabilisatie van het kind het kind zal volgens de abc-methodiek gestabiliseerd worden de veiligheid van het transport net als de outcome van de patint wordt voor een groot deel bepaald door de kwaliteit van primaire opvang en stabilisatie het picu-transportteam bestaat uit een kinderarts-intensivist of een anesthesioloog-kinderintensivist en een kinder-icverpleegkundige dit team is volledig op elkaar ingespeeld en kent elkaars functioneren vanuit de dagelijkse patintenzorg op die manier kan de picu-behandeling al beginnen op locatie continue scholing van deze personen in het vervoeren van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen is essentieel het transportteam beschikt over een speciale trolley waarmee kinderen tot ongeveer 75 kilogram kunnen worden vervoerd de trolley is ingericht als een mobiele intensive care unit micu en is onder andere uitgerust met beademingsapparatuur bewakingsapparatuur en perfusoren voor het continu toedienen van medicatie zie foto 1 daarnaast wordt een uitgebreid arsenaal aan hulpmiddelen meegenomen die nodig zijn bij het waarborgen van de zorg voor ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen volgens de abc-systematiek zie foto 2 ook is een uitgebreid formularium aan medicamenten aanwezig


 ouders kunnen tijdens het interklinisch transport niet mee in de ambulance daarom is een goede voorlichting aan de ouders voorafgaand aan vertrek essentieel de procedure rondom een transport is vrij strak georganiseerd en begint met de aanmelding van een patint door de insturende specialist de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist geeft zo nodig adviezen over de verdere stabilisatie van de patint en de indicatie tot intubatie deze indicatie wordt altijd in samenspraak met de insturende specialist gesteld veelal wordt geadviseerd om indien mogelijk de intubatie plaats te doen vinden op de operatiekamer onder zo gecontroleerd mogelijke omstandigheden in de tussentijd wordt het transportteam gewaarschuwd buiten kantooruren komen zij naar het ziekenhuis er vindt een korte overdracht plaats tussen de dienstdoende kinderarts- intensivist en het transportteam waarna het transportteam begint met de voorbereidingen voor het transport de brancard wordt gecontroleerd volgens een checklist de apparatuur wordt gecontroleerd en diverse medicamenten worden opgetrokken en klaargemaakt voor gebruik op de perfusor de arts van het transportteam maakt bij de meldkamer ambulance melding van een picu-transport waarop zo spoedig mogelijk een ambulance vrijgemaakt wordt de picu-transporten worden altijd uitgevoerd als a1-ritten dat wil zeggen dat altijd zwaailicht en sirene worden gevoerd het streven is om te vertrekken binnen n uur na melding door de insturende specialist bij aankomst van de ambulance vertrekt het transportteam naar het insturende ziekenhuis daar aangekomen volgt een korte medische en verpleegkundige overdracht van de patint waarna het transportteam de behandeling van de patint en daarmee ook de verantwoordelijkheid overneemt er wordt lichamelijk onderzoek verricht volgens het abcprincipe de apparatuur en de perfusoren worden ingesteld en vervolgens wordt de patint overgetild op de transportbrancard kleine kinderen zullen op een vacummatras worden geplaatst de patint wordt aangesloten op de ventilator en de bewakingsapparatuur er wordt dan wederom een kort lichamelijk onderzoek volgens het abc-principe verricht waarna het transportteam vertrekt in overleg met de ambulancechauffeur wordt bepaald hoe er wordt teruggereden naar het eigen centrum niet zelden zal begeleiding van het korps landelijke politiediensten noodzakelijk zijn bij terugkomst in het eigen ziekenhuis wordt de patint overgetild en aangesloten op de apparatuur de patint wordt overgedragen aan de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist het transportteam is vervolgens verantwoordelijk voor het reinigen en aanvullen van de brancard zodat het direct gebruiksklaar is voor een volgend transport sinds 2004 functioneert het transportsysteem in de regio amsterdam waarbij 60 procent van de transportdiensten verzorgd wordt door het academisch medisch centrum en 40 procent door het vu medisch centrum in heel 2004 werden 97 kinderen door een van beide transportteams vervoerd naar een picu respiratoire insufficintie was bij ongeveer 55 procent de primaire reden van opname meer dan de helft van de transporten 56 procent vond plaats buiten kantooruren of op weekenddagen gemiddeld duurt een transport twee uur waarbij het transportteam ongeveer 45 tot 60 minuten aanwezig was in het verwijzende ziekenhuis tijdens de transporten hebben zich geen noemenswaardige problemen voorgedaan op zondagavond omstreeks elf uur wordt een 15-jarig meisje aangemeld met het beeld van een septische shock door de dienstdoende kinderarts-intensivist worden behandelingsadviezen gegeven en wordt het transportteam gealarmeerd rond n uur s nachts arriveert het transportteam dat de patint beoordeelt er is sprake van een ernstige septische shock met een zeer ernstige ards de patint wordt zowel centraal veneus als arterieel opgelijnd er worden diverse vaatvullingen gegeven en vaso-actieve medicatie wordt gestart tevens wordt de beademing fors aangepast uiteindelijk vertrekt het transportteam rond half vier in de ochtend de patint heeft hoge beademingsvoorwaarden peep 20 fio2 10 en forse inotrope ondersteuning dopamine 20 mcgkgmin en noradrenaline 04 mcgkgmin bij gebrek aan plaats in het eigen centrum wordt de patint vervoerd naar een ander ziekenhuis waar men om half vijf arriveert gedurende het transport doen zich geen noemenswaardige problemen voor om half acht s ochtends is het transportteam terug in het eigen centrum rond het middaguur op een maandag wordt melding gemaakt van een vier weken oude baby die respiratoir insufficint is geworden op basis van een rsv respiratoir syncytiaal virus pneumonie door de dienstdoende kinderarts- intensivist worden behandelingsadviezen gegeven en wordt het transportteam gealarmeerd de baby wordt onder gecontroleerde omstandigheden op de operatiekamer gentubeerd door de anesthesioloog bij aankomst in het insturende ziekenhuis wordt de baby onderzocht overgetild op de transportbrancard en aangesloten op de apparatuur er zijn geen verdere interventies noodzakelijk ruim twee uur na de initile melding is het transportteam weer terug in het eigen centrum en wordt de picu-behandeling voortgezet ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen bij wie een noodzaak tot endotracheale intubatie bestaat dienen door een picutransportteam vervoerd te worden naar een picu het vervoer van deze patinten door artsen en verpleegkundigen die zijn opgeleid en getraind in het handelend optreden bij ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen n het gebruik van speciaal materieel heeft een gunstig effect op zowel morbiditeit als mortaliteit  sars-cov-2 serology much hype little data abbreviations emergency use authorization eua severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 christopher farnsworth w neil anderson w   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019  has led to significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world 1  in response to a lack of covid-19 testing the fda issued guidance regarding serologic assays stating that although manufacturers could use the emergency use authorization eua pathway for approval serologic assays could also be marketed in the us bypassing this approval process 2  this has led to a dramatic availability of serologic tests most of which from companies with little to no track record in the in vitro diagnostic market at the time of writing more than 100 manufacturers have notified the fda that they are offering  plan to offer serologic testing in the us and only 4 have received eua clearance 3  this represents an unprecedented release of manufacturer developed laboratory tests that have not been reviewed by the fda some have appeared in non-peer reviewed preprint servers and have both gained attention and generated criticism in the lay press nonetheless calls for serologic testing for covid-19 have continued to gain momentum serology has been suggested to play three roles in the covid-19 pandemic 1 diagnosis 2 identification of convalescent plasma donors 3 screening populations with the purpose of determining exposure and immunity diagnosis a common question from physicians in our hospital network is if serology can be used for diagnosis serologic assays are unlikely to be useful for this application early reports indicate patients become positive for anti-sars-cov-2 igg approximately 7-14 days after onset of symptoms 4  in our hospital the median time from onset of symptoms to patient presentation is 3 days mean 5 days making serologic diagnosis unlikely at the time of initial patient evaluation many have suggested the use of anti-sars-cov-2 igm to detect early infections and many lateral flow-based devices include igm however most igm based assays suffer from higher false positive rates relative to igg based assays 5  due to these limitations molecular techniques are favored for the diagnosis of covid-19 however sensitivity limitations have been noted with molecular testing directing providers to alternate means of testing in pcr-negative patients with compatible symptoms the utility of serologic testing in this setting has yet to be established in our experience testing of patients previously negative by covid-19 pcr revealed a small subset of serologically positive patients 1 of symptomatic pcr negative patients while the exact disease status of these patients is difficult to adjudicate these findings suggest a limited niche for diagnostic serologic testing this presumably patients with high anti-sars-cov-2 titers would be the ideal donor population making this a useful application further studies are needed to demonstrate if antibodies against sars-cov-2 are neutralizing and provide protection at the same level at which they are detected furthermore since many serologic assays do not provide quantitative results there are limited mechanisms for distinguishing between donors with high titers of antibody versus those with low titers if there is an intent to convert qualitative assays to quantitative assays for this purpose they must be evaluated as such including an assessment of precision spanning the reportable range population screening population screening has been proposed to identify exposed patients that are presumptively immune to sars-cov-2 secondary to exposure and to quantify the prevalence of exposure within a population for epidemiologic purposes while specific guidelines regarding how presumptive immunity will be determined and used do not exist this potential use has generated the most excitement in the lay public members of the white house coronavirus task force have touted serologic assays to allow protected americans to return to the workplace and rekindle the economy 7 unfortunately it is not known if anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies are protective at this time although the general assumption is that the presence of antibodies will provide at least some immunity though this is only an assumption it is not without merit given what is known about other respiratory viruses ie influenza as well as the evidence the convalescent plasma may be an effective therapy 8  the challenge with this approach is that even in areas with reported extensive spread of covid-19 seroprevalence is likely low even a laboratory test with excellent sensitivity and specificity is often unhelpful in low-prevalence settings here specificity and the incidence of false positive results must be accurately determined if the prevalence of covid-19 in the population is 20 a test with a sensitivity and specificity of 98 will make the value of a positive result ppv 925 figure 1  in new york city the estimated prevalence is 169 9 therefore if a serologic test has a specificity of 995 the ppv is 766 however if the specificity is lowered to 98 the ppv plummets to 45 or 12 positive results is a false positive in such a scenario one half of those cleared to return to work would not have sars-cov-2 specific antibodies and would be at risk of acquiring and transmitting infection in cities and states with lower prevalence such as missouri 01 10 even a specificity of 995 will result in a ppv of 164  understanding the correlations between prevalence specificity and ppv is a necessity before implementing serologic testing for screening the importance of specificity of serologic tests for screening low prevalence populations was recently demonstrated in a non-peer reviewed publication 11  3300 residents in california were screened for antibodies to sars-cov-2 using a device without an eua the authors found that 15 of those screened were positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies and after analysis found the estimated prevalence to be 24 using 30 specimens from patients pre-covid-19 in combination with the manufacturers claims the authors asserted a sensitivity of 803 and specificity of 995 however the 95 confidence interval of the specificity was 982-999 the authors acknowledged that the device had not been adequately validated and that if the specificity was near98 the estimated prevalence would fall from 24 to 1 with a 95 ci reaching 0 what could be the reason for these false positive results given the homology of sars-cov-2 to other coronaviruses it is likely that antigens used as targets in poorly designed assays will cross react this risk is exaggerated in older populations who are likely to have been exposed to a wider variety of coronaviruses 12  many serologic assays also cross-react in patients with ebv rheumatoid factor and heterophile antibodies careful antigen selection in covid-19 serological assays is required to avoid cross reactivity of anti-seasonal coronavirus antibodies if validation studies are not designed appropriately ie if only young asymptomatic pre-pandemic patients are used as the negative population then these limitations may not be thoroughly vetted and specificity of the assay may be grossly overestimated given the lack of scientific rigor regarding the assessment of available serologic assays it is a necessity that the laboratory community provide thorough examination of these methods and clearly articulate to providers their utility this is particularly true of assays without an eua whose performance may be variable the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi recommends that sensitivity be assessed by analyzing at least 50 positive specimens from patients with confirmed disease 13  ideally this would be performed serially to determine the sensitivity at various days post-symptom onset the clsi also recommends 50 specimens to determine clinical specificity while these recommendations are helpful the rigor of the validation should ultimately be dependent on the intended test population 13  for population-based screening with low seroprevalences the specificity needs to be 99 with small confidence intervals ie between 990-999 to ensure a high ppv this would require a negative control population exceeding 750 people 14 or 2000 people 15 in conclusion while serologic assays have generated much hype there is a need for data to support their clinical utility when not properly evaluated they have the potential to misdiagnose and misinform it is also crucial for laboratories to rigorously validate assays to assure they are suitable for their ultimate use  furthermore as the general public becomes enamored with the promise of covid-19 serologic testing it is the responsibility of laboratory professionals to remind everyone of the peril

coronavirus strains 229e oc38 oc43 and mouse hepatitis virus mhv strain a-59 is described in adults with upper respiratory disease two outbreaks of coronavirus infection occurred one during the winter of 1965-1966 associated with complement fixing cf antibody responses to oc38 oc43 and mhv and the other during the following winter associated with cf antibody responses to 229e in hospitalized children infection with 229e was rare infection with oc38 oc43 and mhv occurred less often in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract disease 35 than in a control group with non-respiratory tract disease 82 the limitations of the cf test using available coronavirus antigens are discussed  several investigators have recently reported the recovery from adults with upper respiratory infection of ether-labile viruses morphologically indistinguishable from mouse hepatitis virus mhv and avian infectious bronchitis virus ebv 1 2 3 4 5 6  the distinctive appearance of these viruses by electron microscopy suggested that they be designated as a new group the coronaviruses 7  members of the group are medium-sued rna-containing and etherlabile and bear characteristic club-shaped surface projections nine of the 23 strains recovered from the human respiratory tract were originally isolated in human embryonic tracheal organ culture hetoc 1 3 6 8  three of the nine were subsequently adapted to growth in monolayer tissue cultures and two others oc38 and oc43 were successfully adapted to growth in suckling mice and shown to be antigenically related to several strains of mhv by cf tests and fluorescence staining 6 9 10  the 14 remaining human strains were originally recovered in tissue culture monolayers and appeared antigenically similar or identical to the prototype tissue culture strain 229e 2 5  little is known of the epidemiology of human infection with coronaviruses cf and neutralizing antibodies to several strains of 685 mhv were found in military recruits before any coronavirus strains had been recovered from man 11  epidemiologic analysis of these findings indicated that although fourfold rises in antibody were frequent there was no discernible association with disease both strain 229e and strain b814 have been shown to cause colds in adult volunteers 1 12  preliminary seroepidemiologic surveys performed in this laboratory suggested that 229e oc38 and oc43 infection occurred with sporadic frequency in adults with upper respiratory tract disease 5 9  this report describes a more extensive seroepidemiologic study using the available cf antigens from human strains and an antigen of mhv strain a-59 shown by hartley and others to detect cf antibody in human sera 11  adults nasopharyngeal washings and acute phase sera were obtained from employees of the national institutes of health with upper respiratory tract disease on or before the fourth day of illness and convalescent phase sera three weeks later there were 466 patients admitted to the study some of them on multiple occasions so that 577 serum pairs were available for study the periods covered were october 1962 through may 1964  and september 1965 through september 5 1967  some aspects of the study have been published 5 13  infants and children throat or nasal swabs and acute phase sera were obtained from pediatric patients on admission to childrens hospital washington dc and convalescent phase sera about three weeks later a diagnosis of lower respiratory tract disease lrtd indicated croup laryngotracheobronchitis bronchitis pneumonia or bronchiolitis control sera were obtained at similar intervals from hospitalized patients with non-respiratory tract disease individuals with incidental respiratory tract disease at the time of selection were excluded from the group there was difficulty in finding sufficient control infants under 12 months of age see table 1  members of the control group were not matched with respect to their length of hospital stay the sera chosen for study were obtained from october 1965 through april 1966 and from october 1966 through april 1967 14  the preparation and maintenance of human embryonic intestine hei diploid cell cultures and their use in the recovery of coronaviruses have been described 5  human embryonic tracheal organ cultures were prepared and maintained as previously reported 3  the methods used for recovery of coronaviruses in organ culture have also been described 3 dr hamre kindly supplied coronavirus strain 229e which had been purified by the terminal dilution technique it was passaged several times in human diploid cell strain wi38 in this laboratory cf antigen was prepared as a single lot of infected wi38 cells 5  eight units of antigen as measured with a standard convalescent human serum were used in all tests cf antigen of mhv strain a-59 was prepared from infected mouse liver nctc 1469 tissue culture as previously described 11  a single lot of antigen was used for the study reported here four to eight units of antigen as measured with hyperimmune mouse serum were used the adaptation of organ culture grown coronavirus strains oc38 and oc43 to swiss mice and the preparation of cf antigens from infected mouse brain have been described 9  the antigens used in this study were from a single lot for each virus and were free of contamination with mycoplasma and cytopathic agents moreover screening cf tests were performed for possible contamination with theilers agent lymphocytic coriomeningitis virus sendai virus mouse leukemia reoviruses rubella mumps measles respiratory syncytial es virus parainfluenza virus types 1 2 3 and 4 and influenza virus types a b and c all such tests were negative the techniques of insuring that the antigens were also free of mhv strains have been previously described 9  eight to 16 units of antigen as measured with hyperimmune mouse serum were used control uninfected wi38 cell nctc 1469 cell and mouse brain antigens were prepared in parallel to infected antigen lots and were included in each test sera reacting with control antigens were not included in  the data reported these omissions account for the differences in the total number of serum pairs analyzed for each antigen see table 2  cf tests were performed by the microtiter technique using overnight fixation at 4 c and 17-18 units of complement as previously described 15  figure 1 is a diagram representing the number of and per cent antibody responses to the various coronavirus antigens tested in mhv and because of their reported close antigenic relationships 9 in certain analyses these agents are grouped together table 1 shows the proportion of infants and children with and without lrtd showing fourfold or greater antibody responses to the three related coronavirus antigens oc38 oc43 and mhv strain a-59 when all age groups were combined a positive correlation between coronavirus infection and lrtd did not exist however the youngest age group under one year with lrtd tended to have more coronavirus infections than the control group but the difference was not statistically significant p  05 in all age groups taken together there was a significant negative correlation with lrtd x  74 p 01 this negative correlation was particularly striking in the children over the age of one x  106 p 01 in table 2 is shown the proportion of individuals tested who had measurable 14 or greater cf antibody to coronavirus antigens during the period 1965-1967 cf antibody to strain 229e was rare in children 06 per cent and quite common in adults 41 per cent cf antibody to oc38 and oc43 was increasingly common in children up to the age of three years when it was measurable in approximately 50 per cent of those tested in adults 72 per cent of those tested had measurable cf antibody to one or both strains during 1962-1964 and 67 per cent during 1965-1967 antibody to mhv strain a-59 was of somewhat lower prevalence approximately 10 per cent in children and 34 per cent in adults during the periods noted above information obtained from serologic tissue culture and organ culture studies is summarized in figures 2 and 3 among adults figure 2 coronaviruses appeared to be rarely associated with upper respiratory tract disease during 1963 and 1964 the frozen nasopharyngeal washings of a small group of patients who in preliminary studies had shown cf antibody responses to strain 229e were examined in hei tissue culture three of these yielded coronaviruses serologically similar to strain 229e sporadic frozen specimens were examined in tracheal organ in the second outbreak antibody responses to oc38 oc43 and mhv antigens were rare and no coronaviruses were recovered in organ culture in children on the other hand figure 3 there appeared to be no meaningful temporal pattern of coronavirus cf antibody responses and no strains were recovered in organ culture  the children under study were examined for evidence of infection by other respiratory viruses and a certain number of dual infections with myxo-or paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses were found there was no evidence that coronavirus infection potentiated the pathogenic effect of infection by either parainfluenza virus 3 or rs virus the two viruses found most often in conjunction with coronaviruses table 3  discussion these studies were undertaken to define more clearly the seroepidemiology of coronavirus infection in adult and pediatric popu-lations serum samples and nasopharyngeal washings were studied from adults with colds occurring in two two-year periods during the first period 1962-1964 detectable coronavirus infection was uncommon however in the winter of 1965-1966 members of the oc38-oc43-mhv group were prevalent and detectable both by serologic and organ culture techniques one year later members of the 229e group were prevalent and again detectable by both serologic responses and virus isolation it is of interest that among adults all the coronavirus recoveries and most of the coronavirus serologic responses occurred in the four winter months of december january february and march in several surveys of colds in adults respira-tory disease was common during these winter months but rhinovirus infection though frequent in the fall and spring was rare 13 16 17  this pattern of rhinovirus infection prevailed in this study during the period 1965-1967 thus during these winter months coronaviruses although still accounting for less than 50 per cent of colds became the predominant identifiable organisms associated with adult upper respiratory disease it is evident from the studies of hospitalized children that infection with coronaviruses was not significantly associated in this survey with pediatric lower respiratory tract disease indeed a negative correlation of coronavirus infection with lrtd was found it may be that the presence of severe lrtd requiring hospitalization interfered in some way with infection of the respiratory epithelium by coronaviruses on the other hand it seems more likely that this negative correlation reflects the fact that it was not possible to select a completely comparable control group control children were drawn from different pediatric wards and their lengths of stay in the hospital frequently differed from those of the test group in any case the data reported suggest that the coronaviruses tested were not an important cause of lrtd in infants and children during the period covered by this study our studies did not provide information on the etiologic association of coronavirus infection with respiratory tract disease in adults two coronavirus strains 229e and b814 were administered to adult volunteers and in both instances a significant number of common colds occurred 1 12  data are still lacking however to show that members of the oc38-oc43 serologic type cause disease under natural conditions it is of interest that in the seroepidemiologic studies of hartley and others where several strains of mhv were tested with sera from military recruits no epidemiologic association of mhv or mhv-like virus infection with respiratory tract disease was made 11  the infrequency of detectable cf antibody to 229e in the pediatric population studied here was surprising although 229e virus infection may indeed be rare in children several other explanations for this anomalous finding are possible the 229e antigen in contrast to the other coronavirus antigens may have reacted with cf antibody to a narrow range of coronavirus serologic types owing either to the type of tissue in which it was made or to some characteristic of the virus itself possibly serum cf antibody as opposed to serum neutralizing or secretory antibody did not develop in children in response to 229e virus infection studies of 229e neutralizing antibody in different age groups would contribute to the clarification of this finding antigenic studies of human coronaviruses have shown that those members of the group which were originally recovered in tissue culture are all closely related to the prototype virus strain 229e 2 5  in contrast the strains isolated in organ culture include at least two and probably several more anti-genie types 10  one type exemplified by strains oc38 and oc43 is clearly related to the mhv group the other type or types have an indefinite relationship with mhv and with the oc38-oc43 group in particular patients yielding coronaviruses in organ culture varied markedly in their antibody responses to the cf antigens used in this study one such patient showed in multiple tests no rise to any of the coronavirus antigens two others showed responses in some tests and not in others infection with strain b814 was likewise difficult to detect serologically using oc38 oc43 mhv and 229e antigens 10  the heterogeneity of antibody response in subjects with known or presumed coronavirus infection and the probable insensitivity of presently available serologic tests in the detection of coronavirus infection indicate that the serologic studies reported here do not describe a complete picture of coronavirus infection it is probable that undetected coronavirus infections occurred in these populations during the study periods cf antigens from the other known coronavirus strains and further efforts to isolate and characterize new strains will contribute to further definition of the epidemiology of coronavirus infection  are antibodies tests accurate understanding predictive values and uncertainty of serology tests for the novel coronavirus naomi brownstein c yian chen ann  antibodies testing in the coronavirus era is frequently promoted but the underlying statistics behind their validation has come under more scrutiny in recent weeks we provide calculations interpretations and plots of positive and negative predictive values under a variety of scenarios prevalence sensitivity and specificity are estimated within ranges of values from researchers and antibodies manufacturers illustrative examples are highlighted and interactive plots are provided in the supplementary material implications are discussed for society overall and across diverse locations with different levels of disease burden specifically the proportion of positive serology tests that are false can differ drastically from up to 3 to 88 for people from different places with different proportions of infected people in the populations while the false negative rate is typically under 10 all rights

currently have limited evidence of efficacy 1  thus it is critical to develop agents to prevent the spread of coronavirus such as vaccines although research and development on vaccine candidates is ongoing 10 11  widespread availability of a safe and effective vaccine is not expected for months or even years 12 13 14  simultaneously there is increasing evidence of asymptomatic infection and spread 15  with scarce testing supplies 16  many people blind to their prior infection status or lack thereof are self-isolating the current situation has even consequently been derided as schroedingers virus 17  without a vaccine excitement about antibodies testing is growing 18 theoretical benefits of identifying individuals with antibodies abound for example health workers with prior undetected asymptomatic infections could gain peace of mind during patient care and conserve personal protective equipment for their remaining susceptible colleagues daily activities such as shopping traveling and dining could begin to resume alleviating currently acute social and economic effects of the pandemic hoping to implement these potential benefits some politicians have considered issuing immunity passports for people who are cleared by an antibodies test 19  yet serology testing is not a panacea and is associated with concerns about its use 20 21 22 23  proposals for implementing serology testing programs and understanding their benefits and limitations are available 24 25 given the increase in testing proper interpretation of the results is critical with implications for medicine public policy and personal action the goal of this paper is to estimate quantify and visualize uncertainty in the predictive values and false positive rates of serology testing candidates available at the time of writing graphical displays of predictive values feature a range of scenarios section 2 reviews key metrics for serology tests section 3 summarizes and visualizes metrics in general and for serology tests operating under an emergency use authorization eua section 4 applies the concepts to specific locations in the united states us section 5 discusses limitations and implications finally section 6 details our statistical and graphical methods this section outlines key statistical definitions related to serology testing readers familiar with testing characteristics may skip to section 3 definitions are included in the supplementary material in section 92 additional details on these concepts and examples relevant to serology may be found elsewhere 25 26 27 28  two properties of serology tests quantify how well the tests perform in on samples in a lab with known antibody status sensitivity is the probability that a serology test correctly classifies a sample with antibodies for sars-cov-2 specificity is the probability that a test correctly classifies uninfected samples as lacking antibodies for sars-cov-2 sensitivity and specificity are pretest quantities or validation metrics primarily meaningful before a serology test is taken sensitivity and specificity are defined by equations 1 and 2 in the supplementary material section 92 rather people who confront serology tests are likely interested in post-test probabilities including positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv ppv is the probability that a person with a positive serology test indeed has a prior infection with and antibodies for sars-cov-2 npv is the probability that a person who tests negative lacks antibodies for and has not yet been infected with sars-cov-2 definitions and calculations for npv and ppv are in equations 3 through 7 ppv and npv are more relevant to patients and clinicians in interpreting serology test results than sensitivity and specificity the complements of the predictive values are probabilities that test results of each type are false the false positive rate fpr the complement of ppv is the proportion of people who test positive that are actually lacking a prior coronavirus infection similarly the false negative rate fnr the complement of npv is the proportion of people who test negative that actually had a prior infection with coronavirus the fpr fnr can be interpreted as the proportion of positive negative serology tests are false positives negatives fpr and fnr are shown in equations 8 and 9  this section reports values for the statistics described in section 2 to help contextualize serology test results prevalence estimates are reported in section 31 graphical displays of npv and ppv for the range of values under study are found in section 32 sensitivity specificity ppv and fpr for tests under study are reported in 33 due to the lack of available diagnostic tests in the us official counts of covid-19 cases are likely undercounted 29 30  additionally people with asymptomatic infections are unlikely to seek medical care or diagnostic testing and are likely excluded from official counts consequently reliable prevalence estimates are limited prevalence which affects predictive value estimates can be considered unknown and varies over time emerging research is beginning to estimate population prevalence over the period from march 31 to april 7 by one estimate 31  the prevalence by state ranged from about 04 in alaska hawaii kentucky and west virgina to 85 in new york with a median prevalence of 09 another estimate 30 from april 11 found infection proportions within states spanning from 01 in rural states to 70 in new york and an overall us prevalence of 12 a third group proposes a method 29 with estimates that could indicate a prevalence of up to 10 of the population as of april 4 2020 additional specific overall and local estimates are currently limited a collection of case studies is highlighted in section 4 in brief the prevalence of specific cities states and counties estimates ranged from less than 1 to about 30 in especially hard hit areas such as chelsea county in boston and new york city in this section we investigate ranges of plausible values of sensitivity specificity for antibodies tests available and and prevalence for relevant areas and compare the predictive values predictive values are of interest based on minima of 80 sensitivity and 90 specificity to reflect reported values for fda-authorized serology tests and described in section 33 in general the false negative rate is low and false positive rate is highly variable for available serology tests figure 1 is a plot of npv for these specificity and sensitivity values and prevalence ranging from 1 to 30 the range currently reported elsewhere as discussed in sections 31 and 4 under these scenarios the minimum npv was 913 indicating that the false negative rate was less than 10 in all scenarios thus npv should be high and fnr should be low for all serology tests within similar ranges for sensitivity specificity and prevalence in other words negative serology tests have a high likelihood of accurately reflecting a lack of antibodies in the general population of non-infected individuals by contrast figure 2 shows a corresponding plot spanning a wide range of plausible ppv values ppv increases with prevalence and is low with lower rates of antibodies in the population at fixed prevalence values specificity also quickly increases ppv with prevalence higher sensitivity improves ppv although the growth of ppv with increases in sensitivity is less pronounced than with increases in specificity at a given prevalence for example an area with 10 prevalence would have 471 ppv for a test with 80 sensitivity and 90 specificity 667 ppv for a test with 90 sensitivity and 95 specificity and 913 ppv for a test with 95 sensitivity and 99 specificity equivalently the false positive rates would be 529 333 and 87 in areas with a 30 infection rate the same tests would yield respective ppvs of 774 885 and 976 and false positives of 226 115 and 24 yet if the prevalence is 1 then ppv could reach 490 for 95 sensitivity and 99 specificity or fall as low as 75 indicating that only 75 of people with positive serology tests in fact possess antibodies put another way for tests with 80 sensitivity and 90 specificity in locations with 1 prevalence about 93 of people with positive serology tests would be expected to lack antibodies for sars-cov-2 figure 1  plot of npv by prevalence 0 to 03 specificity 09 to 1 and sensitivity 08 to 1 the bar on the right with sensitivity is denoted by color with lighter colors denoting lower sensitivity and darker colors denoting higher sensitivity all parameters are reported as decimals ranging from 0 to 1 npv values exceeded 09 for all input parameters as of may 22 2020 the fda has allowed 13 serology tests to operate under an emergency use authorization eua 32  characteristics of these tests appear in table 1  sensitivity estimates range from 83 to 100 with 95 confidence limits ranging from about 68 to 100 specificity estimates range from about 94 to 100 with confidence bounds ranging from 88 to 100 figures 3 and 4 highlight the relationship between ppv and prevalence for each of the 13 serology tests granted an eua by the us fda the figures illustrate the known relationship that ppv should be lower in populations with lower prevalence 28  and that ppv increases more rapidly with increasing specificity than with increasing sensitivity at low prevalence such as 1 many tests exhibit low ppv and high rates of false positives  table 1  the upper limits of false positive rates for 9 tests exceed 60 and 12 tests exceed 50 given 1 prevalence thus in regions with 1 prevalence scenarios having 50 or more percent of positive serology tests corresponding to people lacking sars-cov-2 antibodies would be within the realm of reasonable expectations in addition two tests have not only poor estimated false positive rates but report high precision tests by cellex and chembio are estimated to have 808 and 856 false positives at 1 prevalence with even the lower bounds on their fprhovering around 70 in such low prevalence populations on average anywhere between 7 and 9 out of 10 positive tests by cellex and chembio are expected to be false results for all tests improve with prevalence but overall false positive rates remain concerning although only two point estimates for false positive rates exceed 20 assuming 10 prevalence which is higher than most currently estimated infection rates 30 31  the upper bound for false positive rates exceed 20 for 7 out of 13 tests moreover only 3 tests -abbott architect ortho-clinical igg and roche -have upper bounds on false positive rates below 10 when the prevalence is 10 in other words 10 out of 13 tests could reasonably produce at least 1 false positive out of 10 if the regional prevalence is 10 estimates or confidence bounds of exactly 100 reported for seven out of the thirteen tests are shown for completeness these estimates should be interpreted with caution as tests establishing sensitivity and specificity were done on small samples 32  which may lack sufficient precision 20 33 for estimation when these quantities are expected to be close to 1 in fact while specificity estimates of the tests by ortho-clinical were validated based on samples of around 400 estimates of 100 sensitivity by abbott and roche or 100 specificity by euroimmun and mt sinai were validated on samples of less than 100 yet as shown in equations 6 and 7 perfect 100 specificity implies perfect ppv and perfect sensitivity implies perfect npv in these cases it is especially important to consider the entire range of values for ppv and fpr indeed while tests by mt sinai 3 specificity 09 to 1 and sensitivity 08 to 1 sensitivity is denoted by color with lighter colors denoting low sensitivity and darker colors denoting higher sensitivity all parameters are reported as decimals ranging from 0 to 1 ppv varied widely based on different parameters ranging from 007 to 1 32  interval estimates for the false positive rates are minimum and maximum values of all possible false positive rates calculated at the specified prevalence level for the

positive test results could come from patients lacking antibodies to sars-cov-2 given the sample size 32 of 29 for calculating sensitivity the associated uncertainty could be compounded in the estimates of ppv and fpr rendering the upper bounds critical to measure and understand in this section we evaluate ppv and fpr for a set of areas with three local studies of seroprevalence in

false positive rate in new york ranged from 2 to 88 depending on the region and assumed prevalence under consideration and uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity researchers at massachusetts general hospital conducted a seroprevalence study in the city of chelsea 22 and reported that 315 of participants tested positive the researchers on the chelsea study reported specificity exceeding 995 however the manufacturer biomedomics which is not part of the labs with eua in section 33 reports a sensitivity of 8866 and specificity of 9063 41  assuming prevalence of 315 and specificity and sensitivity values reported by biomedomics 41  ppv was only about 81 this means that in this sample of 63 positives about 51 are expected to be true positives and about 12 are expected to be false positives thus the prevalence estimate in chelsea reported in the press based on this sample alone is likely to be too high in addition participants were recruited by a convenience sample of people outside on a particular street which may not be representative of the general population in chelsea antibodies tests can yield two possible errors with different implications 25  consequences of false negative test results would likely relate to failing to remove negative effects of limitations during the pandemic for example assuming that antibodies indeed confirm protection then people with antibodies who test negative would be safe to return to work but their negative test might convince them to remain at home this would prolong the negative mental and physical effects of social isolation as well as economic effects to individuals and society overall fortunately the false negative rate was under 10 in all scenarios unfortunately the false positive rate can be shockingly high

plasma which could inadvertently harm patients using all samples that test positive could mean that large numbers of samples falsely considered to contain convalescent plasma with would become inadvertent placebos for patients actively struggling with covid-19 one recommendation for individuals who test positive is to consider a follow-up antibody test 45  for instance if the fpr is 50 assuming independent tests the probability of two false positives drops in half 25 the fda includes a calculator for ppv of individual and combined tests 32  follow-up tests are common in other diseases with low ppv screening methods such as mammograms for breast cancer 46  another idea is to test all contacts for antibodies and use their results as evidence to support or refute the original serology test pursuing contacts of additional seropositive individuals may increased contact tracing and testing which can either hinder growth of future outbreaks or divert scarce resources from higher risk contacts 25  moreover increased testing brings cost and feasibility concerns there are some additional limitations of our paper for instance some of the information may become outdated quickly tests operating under an fda eua will likely increase over time for instance one of the 13 tests was added to the original 12 tests made available by fda under eua while writing this paper the fda is aware that at least 160 serology tests were available before the fda increased its oversight 47  this implies some of the antibody tests on the market might even have lower sensitivity or specificity than those included in this paper and therefore have even higher fpr similarly if an infected patient takes the test before antibodies are developed then the sensitivity will be lower an extended discussion is included in the supplementary material section 91 at the same time prevalence may increase over time at least for some of the cities or towns importantly neither the results nor the interpretation for serology tests generalize to diagnostic tests see section 94 in conclusion serology tests for the novel coronavirus generally have low false negative rates and highly volatile false positive rates while false positive rates decrease with increasing prevalence current prevalence estimates remain low in most areas of the us with increasing serology testing and likely increased reporting of testing results it is critical to understand these values and interpret test results properly we hope that this context and interpretation can aid doctors patients researchers and policy makers in informed decision making which may even save lives we collected reported sensitivity and specificity values of serology tests with eua approval by the us fda prevalence estimates were also collected to determine an appropriate range for the plots these values were combined to produce estimates of ppv and npv for a variety of input parameter values we then honed in on specific fda tests and areas that have conducted serology tests to provide estimates and uncertainty for ppv and false positive rates all programs utilized r version 361 ppv and npv were calculated using

infection on antibodies test results and includes a analysis of one of the fda tests for individuals tested too early ie less than two weeks after initial infection section 93 includes intermediate calculations and commentary on the difference between the test positivity rate and estimated prevalence seroconversion is the process during which antibodies develop after infected by covid19 become detectable in the blood the seroconversion duration could complicate the consideration of interpretation of serology test results after infection patients took about 3-40 days to develop detectable antibodies 51 52  typically after 14 days most patients will develop antibodies if the testing period is within 14 days the sensitivities of the tests will be lower we provide an example of the effect of test timing on ppv as noted in section 33 of the main text the test by roche pharmaceuticals 34  reported relatively high ppv compared to its competitors table 1 and figure 4  with 95 confidence intervals of 88100 for specificity and 9961 9991 for sensitivity when the test is taken at least 14 days after infection however when the test is given early ie within 6 days the sensitivity is only about 655  561 -741  when the test is given between 7-13 days the sensitivity is 881  771 -951  figure 7 displays the ppv by prevalence  for the illustrative purposes of this paper we include simplifying assumptions first we assume that people who have not yet had a sars-cov-2 infection with or without symptoms should lack antibodies conversely we assume that a person who does not have antibodies either has not yet been infected with sars-cov-2 or has been infected too recently for the body to have developed antibodies limitations and further discussion on these items are included in sections 5 and 91 and external sources 25 52  statistical notation for these definitions follow for a randomly selected person consider the following random variables d is the indicator of whether

can invoke bayes rule 53 and the law of total probability 54 to show that although sensitivity and specificity clearly differ from ppv and npv respectively these distinct quantities are often misinterpreted in practice 55 56  importantly the ppv and npv of serology tests depend on pretest parameters and on the prevalence of sars-cov-2 which is unknown and difficult to measure 29  ppv and npv correspond to probabilities that test results of each type are correctly classified their complements refer to false testing ratse false positives refer to positive serology tests for patients lacking antibodies while false negatives refer to negative tests for patients with antibodies the studies in new york and chelsea provided only positive testing rates not prevalence estimates the positive testing rate is not the same as the prevalence we conduct sensitivity analyses after including initial calculations results were generally similar often the estimated prevalence and ppv was slightly lower than the seropositivity rate first we break down the probability of testing positive in equation 10 the proportion testing positive in a seroprevalence study can be used to estimate the true prevalence denotep t as the observed proportion who have have antibodies we can substitutep t on the left hand side of 10 as an estimate for pt  1 and solve for the prevalencep the result is equation 11 it is important to note that this means not every combination of sensitivity and specificity is possible for a given positive testing rate as otherwise the estimated prevalence will be negative 37  given that sensitivity and specificity are usually large eg each exceeding 80 we would expect sensitivity  speci f icity  1  0 in order for the prevalence estimate to be non-negative this

t should be at least be large as the false positive rate of the antibody test used in that study indeed if we saw fewer positive tests than the proportion of false positive tests expected by chance if everyone were lacking antibodies then we would have little evidence to suggest that the prevalence is nominally different from zero a sensitivity analysis follows for the studies in chelsea and new york which reported only seropositivity estimates while the seropositive rates are not necessarily identical to the prevalence estimate the estimated seropositivity rate was generally either close or a slight overestimate of the prevalence in chelsea the original seropositivity rate was 315 the updated prevalence estimates based on 11 was 279 which is about 36 lower than the proportion who tested positive using this lower prevalence yields a lower ppv or 786 which would correspond to about to expecting about 49 of the positive tests to be true positives and 14 to be false positives the sensitivity analysis in the new york serology study presented in section 4 there were 156 estimates of ppv resulting from the product of 3 possible values for sensitivity 4 potential values for specificity and 13 potential seropositivity estimates from the two studies 38 40  prevalence estiamtes were calculated based on 11  unlike in the sensitivity analysis for chelsea 36 scenarios resulted in negative estimated prevalence values for these combinations the estimated ppv would be zero which is lower than the ppv in the paper the false positive rate in the sensitivity analysis would be even higher in the sensitivity analysis than in the paper for the 120 remaining scenarios with estimated positive prevalence values the difference between the prevalence and positivity rate was generally small and centered close to zero among the 120 scenarios the differences between the two estimated proportions ranged from -62 to 47 with a median difference of -03 and a mean difference of 06 while the distribution of differences in prevalence was approximately symmetric the distribution of differences in ppv was strongly left-skewed the median difference in ppv was -096 and mean difference was -544 with a range from -41 to 14 the large differences in absolute value of ppv correspond to values where the ppv in this sensitivity analysis is much lower than the ppv when using seropositivity to estimate prevalence however most differences were small in absolute value meaning that most ppv estimates were similar regardless of which value was used for prevalence an updated plot of ppv by prevalence estimated with 11 is shown in figure 8  the shape is similar to figure 6  with noticeable missing segments for combinations with the lower bound of specificity and prevalence estimates outside of the range from about 5 to 20 small prevalence and specificity estimates likely violate expression 12 it is important to note the difference in analysis and interpretation in this paper compared to other tests for sars-cov-2 our paper showed that npv was reasonably high and ppv was low with a lot of potential for harm such as increasing risk for covid19 the interpretations differ for diagnostic tests false positives for diagnostic tests would mean that an uninfected patient would be quarantined and their contacts tested false negative diagnostic tests would mean that an infected person could be cleared their future contacts put at risk of exposure and their past contacts less likely to be tested thus the potential harm for a false negative likely exceeds the potential harm for a false positive and npv should be emphasized to mitigate this harm all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the

serologic tests safe right now richard torres henry rinder m   validation of new immunologic tests aint easy its been said validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a particularly daunting task while we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic serologic testing for antibodies to sars-cov-2 has now come to the limelight sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on healthcare resources in the united states and many other countries specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion ie flatten the curve scientific experts governmental officials and other professionals have publicly advocated for sars-cov-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially re-enter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus a test for detecting immune individuals who will not be re-infected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept but is it realistic the temporary easing of fda marketinguse regulations has enabled the rapid expansion of accurate fast and reliable nucleic acid tests to identify acute infection with sars-cov-2 laboratory professionals diagnostic companies suppliers investigators and hospital administrators have all stepped up to manage acute supply shortages for critical testing components including instruments test-compatible swabs and nucleic acid extraction kits ensuring continued availability of reliable and timely test results as we approach the peak of severe disease prevalence in several regions according to comprehensive models developed by epidemiologists and statisticians we now are faced with a new laboratory crisis sars-cov-2 antibody testing numerous antibody tests have recently become available serologic tests for antibodies to sars-cov-2 are typically based on lateral flow immunochromatography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa currently available tests predominantly target antibodies to 1 of 2 main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus  the nucleocapsid protein n and the spike protein s several assays focus on the s1 subunit of the spike protein which is somewhat specific to each coronavirus strain12 the s1 subunits host the binding domain for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is thought to be the mechanism by which sars-cov gains entry into cells1 because the s1 subunit is highly immunogenic and its affinity for the ace2 receptor appears to correlate with infectivity1 it has been the target for sars-cov-2 serologic assays with reportedly high sensitivity and specificity23 clinical implementation urgently requires validation of these new assays since real-life performance data are scarce the covid-19 pandemic has been marked by an inspiring level of inter-laboratory collaboration at yale-new haven hospital we are particularly grateful for invaluable discussions and sharing of data with johns hopkins massachusetts general hospital mount sinai nyu-langone cornellcolumbia arup mayo clinic and many others scientific journals have contributed via the rapid dissemination of curated studies and preprint sites offer additional information that can be scrutinized in a shorter time frame prior to dedicated reviewer analysis the accumulation and exchange of valuable laboratory evidence has increased our understanding of the serologic testing landscape in a short period of time as a result we now know that individuals with symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection will generally not have detectable antibodies to sars-cov-2 within the first 7 days of the onset of symptoms34 the majority of hospitalized sars-cov-2-infected individuals with confirmed viral rna will have detectable igg antibodies 14 days and more certainly 28 days after the onset of symptoms with assay sensitivity and specificity in the high 90 percents5 total antibody concentration appears to rise to detectable levels first igm and iga both rise 12 days earlier than igg3 unpublished observations preliminary data suggests older individuals produce more robust antibody responses assays differ in overall performance but several methods being validated by large laboratories appear comparable one might therefore ask what exactly is the problem as valuable as this information is it may be insufficient to support critical decisions that providers managers administrators and governmental agencies will face especially regarding immunity in individuals who have remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during the pandemic to determine whether an individual is immune to sars-cov-2 we must know the pre-test probability in the specific population being tested as well as the sensitivity and specificity for protective antibodies of the assay a significant challenge is that to date serological data are largely limited to hospitalized ill patients there is reason to suspect that serological findings in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic exposures may not correlate as well as in hospitalized patients particularly as anecdotal evidence suggests individuals with low viral loads produce lower antibody titers unpublished in addition assessment of antibody effectiveness is problematic even in seriously ill patients approximately one-third of sars-cov-2-infected patients who developed antibodies during hospitalization have been reported to lack antibodies that neutralize virus in plaque growth assays considered the standard laboratory test for antibody effectiveness6 this implies an individual with antibodies may not be immune to reinfection finally a positive antibody result in a potentially immune individual does not guarantee non-infectious status there may be continuing active viral shedding particularly if their antibodies are non-neutralizing the molecular heterogeneity of sars-cov-2 subtypes7 could also have an effect on the sensitivity and specificity of serologic assays the imperfect performance of comparable more established serologic tests for other diseases eg toxoplasma igm may be acceptable because we have a much better understanding of the clinical scenarios unfortunately the same confidence does not hold true for sars-cov-2 serologic testing quality will play a pivotal role in ensuring we are able to obtain the data required to understand covid-19 immunity some of the serologic tests currently available are simply bound to be inferior and that needs to be documented great britain abandoned large-scale purchasing of test kits when the kits failed to satisfy minimum validation metrics8 predictably online direct-to-consumer tests are being aggressively marketed without any published information to evaluate their clinical performance9 while some antigenic targets have shown minimal cross-reactivity with the 4 prevalent non-sars-cov-2 coronaviruses2 without validation studies there is a real risk that some assays may simply reflect prior exposure to the common cold fortunately reputable commercial entities with experienced scientists sophisticated equipment and good manufacturing practices have begun to release serologic assays under fda guidance commercial assays typically undergo extensive pre-release standardization including testing for interferences and matrix effects quality control and test results in large patient cohorts this sets the stage for acquisition of clinical and epidemiologic data but concerns remain when proposals call for testing populations different than those used to validate the assay what if a healthcare worker hcw who had a fever and no other symptoms 14 days ago wants to return to work and tests positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies can we assume with high confidence that this hcw is both immune and non-infectious if we are wrong then we have placed patients and co-workers at risk a failed prevention is also likely to erode faith in the integrity of laboratory tests for the disease we have heard the argument that any testing is better than none providing a path to restoring normalcy and the lack of which has high ongoing societal costs as laboratory professionals we can only respond that for anti-sars-cov-2 serology a bad assays will always be counterproductive b good assays have not been proven in the proposed test population and c more experience is needed to help us properly interpret the serologic test results regulatory and health officials appear to recognize these limitations eg return to work guidelines from the cdc currently do not include serologic testing the role of serologic testing in identifying potential donors for convalescent plasma remains to be fully investigated as is the therapeutic benefit of such an intervention in this setting but other uses for serologic testing may emerge one such clinical scenario where sars-cov-2 serologic assays may be particularly useful is when a positive serology is accompanied by repeatedly negative nucleic acid testing in the setting of a highly suggestive clinical presentation serology may provide the basis for specific therapies for covid-19 infection still until we understand the patterns of antibody response to sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic individuals and the correlation of antibody response with susceptibility to re-infection it seems prudent to apply caution to the criteria used to frame economic social and corporate policy biological variability is the bane of clinical pathology in the setting of validation and clinical application of serologic testing this variability presents a daily struggle reputable diagnostic companies and both commercial and academic clinical laboratories have repeatedly demonstrated that the value of dedication to testing quality ensures clinical utility health industry manufacturing experts engineers quality and regulatory managers sales professionals scientists and physicians have been working diligently under significant duress during the covid-19 pandemic to the great benefit of society as laboratory medicine professionals we must now leverage these efforts by ensuring that a serologic tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies perform as well as intended and b we provide information that enables healthcare providers administrators and health officials to best interpret and apply the available evidence at this point in the evolution of serologic testing for sars-cov-2 we must say in unison caveat emptor  sars-cov-2 infection serology a useful tool to overcome lockdown marzia nuccetelli massimo pieri sandro grelli marco ciotti roberto miano massimo andreoni sergio bernardini   in early december 2019 a novel human coronavirus was identified as the agent responsible for the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin in wuhan capital of hubei province china1 the virus was classified as a wrapped rna betacoronavirus2 which was readily called sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 223 the sars-cov-2 infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 documented both in hospitals and in home structures1 the world health organization who on january 12 2020 declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on march 11 who assessed that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic the sars-cov-2 infection has been extremely contagious with over 2314621 infected people and 157847 death cases confirmed in laboratories since april 20 20204 it has been rapidly spreading all over the world with minor local differences inducing a progressive growth in the number of patients who need access to emergency departments and an increasing demand in diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection5 the covid-19 pandemic is more than a public health emergency it is a financial and political crisis afflicting every nation in the world to date millions of people stay at home worldwide to minimize transmission of sars-cov-2 except healthcare workers and workers employed in essential services such as food production transport and delivery police firefighters and others267 in the meantime that social isolation lockdown prevents and controls the pandemic diffusion to mitigate sars-cov-2 spreading states economies get in serious troubles and many governments are looking to find a good balance between prevention of sars-cov-2 disease and a soften up lockdown to restart industrial production and limit gross domestic product loss in the absence of a vaccine authorities have to find a way to reach the best compromise between covid-19 prevention and lockdown economic and social impact8 indeed it is well known that isolation in the elderly may increase the risk of cardiovascular autoimmune and neurocognitive diseases together with mental health problems not only these but many other important social aspects of peoples daily life have to be considered education stress and family conflicts and job lost911 schools have been suspended nationwide in 188 countries according to the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization and over 90 enrolled learners 15 billion young people are now out of education it should be considered that childrens daily routines are important in particular for those with special needs eg children with autism children and adolescents living in isolation in abusive homes are in danger during this time of economic uncertainty and stress12 finally distance-learning educational activities are not available to everyone and are a source of inequity worldwide13 moreover how to manage surgical patients during covid-19 pandemic is still a matter of debate with a tremendous impact on the surgery units organization and productivity14 to date all patients must be judged as potentially positive in consideration of the high estimated number of asymptomatic subjects and of the maximum contagiousness that occur 23 days immediately preceding the onset of symptoms recently it has been shown that surgery performed on patients unaware of being infected and in the incubation phase determines a 20 increasing risk in postoperative mortality and 50 in post-surgery intensive care unit hospitalization possibly because surgery led to an inflammatory process acceleration causing covid-19 progression15 currently sars-cov-2 rna detection in the nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage bal together with some hematological parameters and chest computed tomography ct are the primary tools for confirmation of covid-19 clinical suspicion8 detection of viral nucleic acid takes place by real-time quantitative pcr rt-qpcr method inside authorized laboratories with biological safety class 2 however rt-qpcr kits can give some false-negative results depending on swab sampling and extraction method and on the possibility that virus even if present in the individuals is not detectable in nosepharynx mucous membrane16 recently some studies described a discrepancy between the diagnostic power of rt-qpcr and ct the latter being more sensitive8 incidence of false negatives at molecular tests sometimes force repetition of the same up to three times in clinically suspected covid-19 patients andor with a covid-19 ct scan pattern8 new more user-friendly molecular tests are on the horizon for out of the lab sars-cov-2 rna screening utilizing heating unextracted diagnostic samples obliterate nuclease and cards to run clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprs methods as dna endonuclease targeted crisprs trans reporter17 in this context a great debate is ongoing about the role of serological assays able to detect igg iga or igm anti-sars-cov-2 in serum plasma or capillary blood to have a clear picture of the outbreak size in each country to assess the degree of immunization and to support the decision to re-admit people at work18 several serological assays have been developed since the beginning of covid-19 pandemic including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa rapid antibody immunochromatographic tests point-of-care test poct-fluorescence assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays clias18 more than 120 different diagnostic kit brands have been proposed on the market many are ce european community approved to date very few are food and drug administration fda approved1920 serological tests to detect antibodies against viral antigens are not yet widely used during this pandemic but rather in a leopard spot manner in publics and private laboratories however they could be as useful as they were during sars epidemic of 200221 and some studies demonstrate the anti-sars-cov-2 iggigm presence in clinically confirmed cases with negative rt-qpcr results22 serological tests are cheaper than molecular tests require a shorter analytical time and productivity can be much greater than molecular tests in case of automated instruments in medium-large hospital laboratories employing clia and elisa serological tests for specific sars-cov-2 antibodies detection in patients blood are currently important to a trace contacts b activate serological surveillance at the local regional and national level and c identify those who have already had contact with virus23 assuming there is protective immunity serological information can be used to decide return at work of infected workers especially people who work in environments in which they can potentially be exposed to sars-cov-2 eg health professionals unfortunately majority of in vitro diagnostic ivd companies do not report nature of the antigens utilized in the assays and then it is difficult to understand whether antibodies detected with different kits and methodologies have a neutralizing effect on the virus possibly through binding with the viral spike protein s subunits receptor-binding domain rbd2425 in addition serological tests can be used retrospectively in post-mortem diagnosis and finally they can be eventually used together with molecular tests for improving their diagnostic accuracy furthermore in the near future serological tests could play a role in the efficacy evaluation of any identified vaccines26 although igm antibodies generation may occur as rapidly as the viral genetic material in the respiratory tract generally the timing of immunoglobulin production from 4 days after the onset of symptoms to 1014 days limits its applicability in the acute phase diagnosis2728 nevertheless it should be pointed out that molecular tests represent an instantaneous picture of possible virus presence whereas serological tests display virus presence during a wider phase of the infectious process whether or not it reaches a clinical relevance moreover in particularly serious cases the use of serological tests in titration of convalescent patients hyperimmune plasma cannot be excluded once the antibodies ability to neutralize the virus has been established after considering all possible side effects of this treatment29 about that fda is coordinating a national effort to develop blood-based antibody-rich covid-19 therapies serological tests through the study of humoral response profile and clinical observations may also contribute to definition of igg serum concentration suitable for a subject to be immune as well as the persistence time of any immunization based on all the above considerations the aim of this study was to compare and to evaluate different serological tests diagnostic accuracy two different immunochromatographic card tests an immunofluorescence chromatographic card test and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay test able to detect anti-sars-cov-2 igg and igm in healthy controls and in covid-19 patients monitored at tor vergata university covid-hospital of rome from march 16 to 23 april 2020 in our hospital were performed 9414 nasopharyngeal swabs mean age 554  190 years with 1085 rt-qpcr sars-cov-2-positive results mean age 621  187 years at first card 1 was the only available method for serological screening of nurses physicians and other healthcare workers the test was performed on about 1200 people and to evaluate card 1 serological specificity and sensitivity we collected blood samples related to people analyzed by rt-qpcr at least after 4 days from the execution of the nasopharyngeal swab we selected 307 samples as follows 82 with rt-qpcr nasopharyngeal-positive swabs mean age 634  157 years and 225 with rt-qpcr nasopharyngeal-negative swabs mean age 545  195 years on this cohort specificity was 100 but sensitivity was lower 536 and 769 for igm and igg respectively although commercial manufacturers claim their tests have high sensitivity and specificity many of them have not published on field validation studies yet later on with other tests becoming available we decided to compare the anti-sars-cov-2 igg and igm detection sensitivity and specificity among different methods and kits two immunochromatographic card tests named card 1 and card 2 fig 1a one immunofluorescence chromatographic card test card 3 fig 1b and one chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay clia at this purpose we collected 43 positive samples from covid-19 patients with rt-qpcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection mean age 631  130 years and 40 control subjects negative to nasopharyngeal swabs rt-qpcr mean age 499  128 years specificity and sensitivity were calculated using receiver operating characteristic roc curves for semi-quantitative tests and with formulas reported under materials and methods for qualitative cards results with the analytical parameters for each test area under curve auc sensitivity and specificity are shown in table 1 they have been correlated to the manufacturers cut-off and recalculated on a best fit cut-off that emerged from our data analysis the roc curves have optimal auc values close to 1 for igg detection in card 3 and clia 0981 and 0997 respectively auc values for igm detection are moderately lower 0921 and 0943 respectively fig 2 moreover our data displays an excellent specificity for all the immunocromatographic tests 100 with a slight decrease in the igm specificity of clia 94 on the other hand igg sensitivities are about 90 for all tests with better performances for card 3 and clia 93 and 95 respectively igm sensitivities are lower around 84 with a best performance of card 2 878 and a low value for card 1 614 interestingly with our recalculated best fit cut-off 054 cutoff index coi instead of 1 coi clia igm sensitivity increased from 84 to 91 due to the rapid spreading of covid-19 pandemic many molecular and serological detection tools have been rapidly developed818263033 laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection was based on rt-qpcr-positive results34 however molecular tests carried out through swabs can also be negative in people who harbor the virus because swab collection and time of sampling are critical in severe cases the most suitable samples showing a higher rna-positive rate seem to be bal or deep sputum35 and who recommends to repeat a negative test under a strong clinical suspicion moreover the great sanitary and social pressure increased the request in the number of tests carried out in laboratories leading to a worldwide shortage of kits and reagents therefore today ivd companies are getting in trouble in delivering an adequate number of tests to cover all laboratories needs for this reason who and centers for disease control and prevention recommend a prioritization of testing policy36 of course the sustainability grade of covid-19 screening in different countries may determine serious inequities the most used viral proteins as antigens in the available serological assays are as follows nucleocapsid protein n transmembrane spike protein s or protein s subunits rbd37 whatever the method used nature of the antigen is important considering that detection of antibodies directed against spike protein or its subunits are more likely to have a neutralizing activity and would better describe the immunization state according to these observations our samples higher sensitivities were obtained with the assays based on the presence of both n and s proteins therefore this information should be reported on kit datasheets but several times it is missing based on our good analytical performance results for all tested methods it should be pointed out that chemiluminescence assays are fully automated and can be run in total automation laboratories also limiting technologists exposition to blood samples about laboratory safety of technologists engaged in routine hematologybiochemistry we are confident that these procedures are not deemed to be aerosol generating moreover viraemia does not appear to be a significant feature of mild-to-moderate covid-19 and where viral rna has been detected this has been at a low level nevertheless viraemia may be a feature in more severe covid-19 although current data are conflicting about that however it is strongly recommended to wear face masks gloves disposable coats and protective glasses mandatory safety set in italian clinical laboratories regarding immunochromatographic cards they are fully manual and the reading is subjective whereas immunofluorescence cromatographic cards set up is manual but the reading is accomplished through a fluorescence detector traceability is complete in clia and in fluorescence assays furthermore both of them are able to send results directly to laboratory information system we strongly suggest to revise the cut-off values reported on datasheets by companies because sometimes they are calculated in a small number of subjects belonging to a specific ethnicity or region in addition given the large number of certified companies able to produce and distribute serological kits each of them should be first tested and validated by accredited laboratories in each context relying on the instruments on the available economic investments and on the wideness of screenings all different methods described can be utilized considering the limits of each one for example screening sustainability should take into account the costbenefit ratio assuming the cost of one immunochromatographic card igg  igm as 10 the cost of an immunofluorescence card as 15 igg  igm and the cost of clia igg  igm as 20 nevertheless different strategies can be chosen depending on the target support to diagnosis with igm or serological screening and epidemiology studies with only igg finally considering the advantage that immunochromatographic cards are ready-to-use and time-saving38 in some contexts may be easier to analyze capillary blood rather than collect centrifuge transport and store blood samples airports prisons religious communities sports associations and centers for the elderly in our study we used serum also in the immunocromatographic cards so we cannot completely exclude different performances with capillary blood at present most countries are in some form of lockdown with journeys severely restricted and reduced to essential trips only these security measures reduce disease transmission by reducing the number of susceptible persons in the population or by reducing the basic reproductive number r0 that is modulated by such factors as duration of viral shedding infectiousness of the organism individuals at stage i stealth carriers and contacts matrix between infected and susceptible persons39 moreover given that serological assay sensitivities in our study around 94 and 84 for igg and igm respectively implicate a number of false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments the only currently available procedure to reduce sars-cov-2 transmission is to identify and to isolate persons who are contagious at this purpose we would like to submit a proposal for a flowchart in which serological tests are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase fig 3 the flowchart shows two different paths as follows in the first there are subjects who have always been asymptomatic in the second there are patients who have overcome the disease serology is integrated with nasopharyngeal rt-qpcr swab when necessary to exclude topical virus presence it is true that there is no 100 guarantee of virus-free among the groups tested with serological and molecular assays but in the flowchart we propose a 2-week preventive quarantine and a second serological iggigm assay before re-admitting people at work taking into account that no test method is perfect and there are still a lot of unknown elements for this virus social distancing should be kept for a longer time especially before a valid vaccine or therapy are established in fact it will be still highly suggested that people finally labeled as return to work should continue to use personal protections such as face mask frequent hand-washing and keeping necessary physical distances with each other the median day of serum conversion for both igg and igm has been calculated 13 days after symptom onset2740 so the preventive security measures together with the double igg and igm serological testing one at the beginning of the quarantine and one after 2 weeks can be helpful for recovery of activities in less time and in safety obviously the span of natural immunization is still unknown and will be determined in the future through clinical and serological follow-up for this reason we prudently suggest a time of 3 months for testing igg-positive subjects considering a sars-cov-2 epidemic duration of at least 6 months reported during 2002 sars epidemic41 finally prevalence is currently determined on the number of subjects with positive rt-qpcr nasopharyngeal swabs then the real prevalence is probably much higher if we compare the most affected northern italy region covid-19 prevalence lombardia 067 to a center italy region prevalence lazio 009 the positive predictive value of serological tests would be extremely low in the second case serological screening should therefore be performed first on an epidemiologically significant population sample to define the usefulness of a more massive screening42 in italy such population serological sample screening 150000 subjects will be carried on by may 2020 to establish covid-19 prevalence in each different region and to support the management of the so-called phase two the flowchart proposed in this work emphasize the importance of serological tests and manage resources for resuming activities and overcoming lockdown in particular for wide screenings through blood sampling including surgical patients we recommend to adopt clia methods in large hospital laboratories working in total automation immunochromatographic cards could be utilized during sampling in specific contexts outside the hospitals such as follows high prevalence areas airports police and military forces stations prisons immigrants homeless religious and other communities nevertheless from a public health perspective testing for igg anti-sars-cov-2 presence could determine who has been exposed to better define the possibility of asymptomatic infections and to give us a more reliable case counts and mortality estimates and a useful tool to control the restarting phase lastly in a very less time all countries will be challenged by phase two but until the neutralizing effect of detected antibodies with all different methods and antibody serum level needed to be fully protected towards a re-infection will be definitively reported we could not consider serological positivity as a license to quit social distance rules and protective devices serum samples were collected from rt-qpcr-diagnosed

yi-wei tang jonathan schmitz e david persing h charles stratton w alexander mcadam j   the identification by us public health officials of presumptive covid-19 cases believed to be due to community transmission of this infection brings into sharp focus the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 15 the current recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 from the cdc are that clinicians coordinate this testing with local public health authorities andor the cdc the preferred testing method is the real-time reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr test 68 similar to that developed for the diagnosis of sars-cov 9 10 viral cultures are not recommended this commentary addresses current issues for the laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 that must be understood by clinicians clinical microbiology laboratories and public health authorities i initial respiratory tract specimen collection for diagnosis and screening of patients with covid-19 pneumonia within 5 to 6 days of the onset of symptoms patients with covid-19 have demonstrated high viral loads in their upper and lower respiratory tracts 1114 a nasopharyngeal np swab andor an oropharyngeal op swab are often recommended for screening or diagnosis of early infection 9 12 15 a single np swab has become the preferred swab as it is tolerated better by the patient and is safer to the operator np swabs have an inherent quality control in that they usually reach the correct area to be tested in the nasal cavity wang et al have just reported that op swabs n  398 were used much more frequently than nasal swabs n  8 in china during the covid-19 outbreak however the sars-cov-2 rna was detected in only 32 of op swabs which was significantly lower than the level in nasal swabs 63 16 while collectiontesting of both nasal and op swabs either as independent specimens or together within a single aliquot of viral transport medium might be an attractive option under normal circumstances institutions must also consider the potential stress that this pandemic places on nationalinternational supply chains in this light another excellent reason to limit testing with np swabs is to prolong supplies of flocked swabs andor transport media however as we understand more about respiratory and oral contact routes of transmission we may learn that patients with pharyngitis as a dominant initial presenting symptom can be adequately sampled via the op route in order to properly obtain an np swab specimen the swab must be inserted deeply into the nasal cavity patients will likely flinch but that means the swab has hit the target swabs should be kept in place for 10 s while being twirled three times swabs should have flocked nontoxic synthetic fibers such as polyester as well as synthetic nylon handles 17 collecting an npop swab specimen may carry a theoretical risk of transmitting sars-cov-2 particularly if airborne transmission is demonstrated as the investigation of the covid-19 outbreak continues 18 if personal protective equipment ppe cannot be utilized due to scarcity of such ppe other means of collecting upper respiratory tract specimens will be needed 18 one alternative option for collecting an upper respiratory tract specimen to evaluate patients with suspected covid-19 pneumonia is a self-collected saliva specimen 1922 should the supply of swabs become scarce other nonflocked swabs and transport media have been cleared equivalently by the food and drug administration fda under an emergency use authorization eua but head-to-head comparisons are lacking currently after collection swabs should be placed in viral universal transport medium for rapid transportation to the clinical microbiology laboratory ideally under refrigerated conditions 17 it should be noted however that in some cases salivanpsops may miss early infection and that in later infection the main site of replication may have shifted to the low respiratory tract repeated testing or obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens may be required moreover other respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses must be ruled out in many ways covid-19 highlights the key difference between analytic and clinical sensitivities that is the ability of an assay to detect a pathogen when it is present in a clinical specimen versus the ability of a test to identify a patients overall infected status the latter of course reflects various other factors that include the specimen site and method of collection in conjunction with the burden of organism as a function of anatomic location disease severity and time symptomatic and variability of these factors from individual to individual repeated testing may be particularly important if a patient has a clinical picture of viral pneumonia a potential exposure history andor radiographic findings chest computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri scan consistent with covid-19 pneumonia equally challenging are how the results of a single undetected result should impact decisions regarding patient quarantine and social distancing in particular when the patients themselves are health care providers including clinical laboratory staff serology as discussed in the postanalytical section may assist in such situations ii late detection and monitoring of patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia ideally sputum sampling or bronchoalveolar lavage should be used for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens as they have yielded the highest viral loads for the diagnosis of covid-19 18 23 a recent study revealed that samples bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid yielded the highest sars-cov-2 rna rate although this study did not compareevaluate results from np swabs 16 patients who present with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may require emergent intubation as well as respiratory isolation in a negative-pressure room if possible a lower respiratory tract sputum specimen should be collected during the intubation procedure alternatively sputum andor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens can be collected after intubation 9 11 however some patients with covid-19 pneumonia have demonstrated high viral rna loads of sars-cov-2 in fecal material 24 25 as well as delayed shedding from the respiratory tract 4 18 late in their clinical course enteric involvement previously has been seen in patients with severe novel coronavirus infections 9 2632 in four such studies sars coronavirus was isolated from stool cultures 26 28 31 in another study sars coronavirus was demonstrated inside enterocytes by electron microscopy 30 thus aside from direct respiratory sampling the preferred method for detecting sars-cov-2 in advanced covid-19 cases may be a rectal swab and real-time rt-pcr 9 2628 3032 iii safety measures for specimen processing for pcr processing and testing processing of respiratory specimens should be done in a class ii biological safety cabinet 6 9 10 although some laboratories would argue that biosafety level three bsl-3 work procedures should be used and that the safety cabinet should be in a negative-pressure room within the laboratory such as that used for mycobacterial cultures for nucleic acid extraction before real-time rt-pcr is performed the specimen should be transferred to lysis buffer under this bsl-2 cabinet the lysis buffer should contain a guanidinium-based inactivating agent as well as a nondenaturing detergent indeed the buffers included in common commercial extraction platforms such as the biomrieux easymag or qiagen ez1 do contain guanidiumdetergents and are able to inactivate any viable coronavirus 3335 similarly universal transport medium that includes guanidinium salt is available from merlin biomedical xiamen china httpwwwchinamerlincomenindexphppproductsshowid166sidcid68lanmu2 because this test is a reverse transcription method the salivaswabs used to collect the clinical specimens should be quickly added to lysis buffer to disinfect the specimen as well as to stop degradation of the coronavirus rna 6 9 10 the clinical specimensswabs should not be heated to 56c for 30 min as evidence suggests that this process may also degrade the coronavirus rna even as it inactivates viable coronavirus 9 36 moreover self-enclosed systems integrating nucleic acid extraction amplification and detection such as id now abbott san diego ca 37 38 cobas liat roche molecular systems pleasanton ca and genexpert cepheid sunnyvale ca 39 when available and meeting local regulatory requirements for sars-cov-2 testing will be very useful once the clinical specimen in viral transport medium is transferred into a cartridge in a class ii biosafety cabinet the cartridge is sealed many of these random-access sealed devices are suitable for point-of-care testing for local hospitals and clinics without biosafety cabinets in this situation the specimen collector in appropriate protective gear splash guardgoggles mask gloves and disposable laboratory coat could directly transfer the specimen into detection cartridges at bedside or in a location without a class ii biosafety cabinet and the closed cartridge could be safely placed on an instrument for testing however spills of transport solution during transfer to these cartridge-based tests should be avoided and if they occur decontamination should be performed as appropriate i assay selection immunoassays have been developed for rapid detection of sars-cov-2 antigens or antibodies these rapid point-of-care immunoassays are generally lateral flow assays but high-throughput immunoanalyzer versions are also in development for population-level screening such lateral flow assays have been developed for detecting antigens such as the sars-cov-2 virus or for detecting antibodies igm and igg against covid-19 rapid antigen lateral flow assays would theoretically provide the advantage of a fast time to result and low-cost detection of sars-cov-2 but are likely to suffer from poor sensitivity early in infection based on the experience with this method for influenza flu viruses 4044 monoclonal antibodies specifically against sars-cov-2 have been under development and several rapid antigen assays are being developed 45 there is concern that given the variability of viral loads in covid-19 patients antigen detection may miss cases due to low infectious burden or sampling variability serology measures the host response to infection and is an indirect measure of infection that is best utilized retrospectively serological methods are rapidly being developed and have proven to be useful in confirming past covid-19 25 serology previously has had an important role in the epidemiology of sars 46 and other coronavirus outbreaks 47 rapid lateral flow assays for both igm and igg antibodies undoubtably will play an important role in the covid-19 outbreak and should allow the burden of infection the role of asymptomatic infections the basic reproduction number and the overall mortality to be determined however igm responses are notoriously nonspecific and given the weeks required to develop specific igg responses serology detection is not likely to play a role in active case management except to diagnoseconfirm late covid-19 cases or to determine the immunity of health care workers as the outbreak progresses cell culture is not recommended for diagnostic purposes ii assay selection for molecular detection of sars-cov-2 random-amplification deep-sequencing methods played a major role in the initial identification of sars-cov-2 4852 deep sequencing molecular methods such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic next-generation sequencing will continue to be needed to determine future mutations of sars-cov-2 but are currently impractical for diagnosing covid-19 most of the molecular diagnostics being developed for the diagnosis of covid-19 involve real-time rt-pcr assays including those from the us centers for disease control and prevention 53 charit institute of virology in berlin germany 7 54 and hong kong university 21 55 other molecular methods are being developed and evaluated worldwide and include loop-mediated isothermal amplification multiplex isothermal amplification followed by microarray detection and crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-based assays 56 iii target selection for real-time rt-pcr assays a real-time rt-pcr method is recommended for molecular testing 6 810 a major advantage of real-time rt-pcr assays is that amplification and analysis are done simultaneously in a closed system to minimize false-positive results associated with amplification product contamination there are a number of coronaviruses that cause respiratory and intestinal infections in humans 8 57 among these coronaviruses are a group of sars-like bat coronaviruses including both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 that comprise a unique clade under the subgenus sarbecovirus 57 58 coronaviruses have a number of molecular targets within their positive-sense single-stranded rna genome that can be used for pcr assays 6 7 57 58 these include genes encoding structural proteins including envelope glycoproteins spike s envelope e transmembrane m helicase hel and nucleocapsid n 5759 in addition to the genes that encode structural proteins there are species-specific accessory genes that are required for viral replication these include rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp hemagglutinin-esterase he and open reading frame 1a orf1a and orf1b 7 5355 57 58 in the united states the cdc recommends two nucleocapsid protein targets n1 and n2 53 while who recommends first-line screening with an e gene assay followed by a confirmatory assay using the rdrp gene 7 chan et al have just developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time rt-pcr assays targeting the rdrphel s and n genes of sars-cov-2 among them the covid-19-rdrphel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro and higher sensitivity and specificity 59 however it is likely that well-optimized targets will arise from a number of viral genomic locations since assay performance is usually dictated by the reagent design not the target itself since the viral genes are present in equal copy numbers to avoid potential cross-reaction with other endemic coronaviruses as well as potential genetic drift of sars-cov-2 at least two molecular targets should be included in the assay various investigators in different countries have used a number of these molecular targets for real-time rt-pcr assays in the united states the cdc has selected two loci in the nucleocapsid gene as the two-target assay appears to be performing well 53 one study utilized two sequence regions open reading frame 1b and a nucleocapsid protein that are highly conserved among sarbecoviruses for initial real-time rt-pcr testing 6 another study in hong kong china used two targets for its rt-pcr assay the first used the nucleocapsid for screening followed by confirmation by the open reading frame 1b 55 in germany two molecular targets envelope and rna-dependent rna polymerase have been selected 7 in china at the time of manuscript preparation several molecular devices had received urgent approval 8 to date there has been no indication that any one of the sequence regions used offers a unique advantage for clinical diagnostic testing however the ideal design would include at least one conserved region and one specific region to mitigate against the effects of genetic drift especially as the virus evolves within new populations in the united states regulatory issues have complicated the development and implementation of laboratory-developed molecular tests for the diagnosis of covid-19 on 29 february 2020 the fda issued new guidance for laboratories to be able to develop and implement covid-19 molecular diagnostic tests prior to obtaining eua laboratories are required to submit an eau to the fda within 15 business days after validation moreover the validation must include the specimen types eg nasopharyngeal oropharyngeal or saliva that are to be used clinically although these new regulatory burdens did not prohibit the development of molecular laboratory testing for the diagnosis of covid-19 they did create a lot of extra work at the time of writing the us fda had granted quite a few euas httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesemergency-use-authorizationscoronavirus2019 accessed 28 march 2020 i interpretation of molecular results in the united states initially if both of two targets in the cdc assay nucleocapsid proteins n1 and n2 test positive a case is considered to be laboratory confirmed 53 a cycle threshold ct value of less than 40 is defined as a positive test while a ct value of 40 or more is defined as a negative test a ct value of 40 for only one of the two nucleocapsid protein n1 and n2 is defined as indeterminant and requires confirmation by retesting 53 currently in china for the assays with three targets positives for two or more targets are considered positive 60 although some correlations have been revealed viral loads determined by real-time rt-pcr assays should not be used yet to indicate covid-19 severity or to monitor therapeutic response 1113 61 62 however low ct values indicating high viral loads may be used as an indication of transmissibility 18 63 ii test of cure and test of infectivity monitoring patients with resolution of covid-19 pneumonia may also be important in terms of when they should be released from isolation and discharged if discharged patients are still shedding viable coronavirus they are likely to infect other people 27 therefore self-quarantine for up to 1 month has been recommended in some cases np and op swabs may not be sufficient for either test of cure or test of infectivity 64 but this needs further investigation one approach to test of cure has been to demonstrate two consecutive negative real-time rt-pcr tests from rectal swabs this suggestion is based on the fact that sars-cov-1 was cultured from stool during the 2002-2003 sars outbreak 26 28 31 and sars-cov-2 has been cultured from stool during the covid-19 outbreak 16 thus a rectal swab that is positive by real-time pcr testing suggests that this patient may be shedding viable sars-cov-2 in their stools thereby remaining infectious 16 2428 3032 however a very recent study on 20 serial covid-19 patients indicated that infectious virus was not isolated from stool samples in spite of high virus rna concentrations 14 the correlation of rt-pcr positivity in stool with recovery of live virus from the same samples remains to be fully investigated iii serology of covid-19 members of the coronavirus family have four structural proteins the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins two of these proteins appear to be important antigenic sites for the development of serological assays to detect covid-19 serological methods have focused on detecting serum antibodies against s proteins from the coronavirus spike 47 the coronavirus envelope spike is responsible for receptor binding and fusion and determines host tropism and transmission capability 57 58 s proteins are determined by the s gene and are functionally divided into two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 domain is responsible for receptor binding while the s2 domain is responsible for fusion sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is found on human respiratory cells renal cells and gastrointestinal cells 57 65 66 the other protein that appears to be an important antigenic site for the development of serological assays to detect covid-19 is the n protein which is a structural component of the helical nucleocapsid the n protein plays an important role in viral pathogenesis replication and rna packaging antibodies to the n protein are frequently detected in covid-19 patients 67 68 suggesting that the n protein may be one of the immunodominant antigens in the early diagnosis of covid-19 69 as mentioned above rapid lateral flow assays for antibodies igm and igg produced during covid-19 have been developed 70 seroconversion occurred after 7 days of symptomatic infection in 50 of patients 14 days in all but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load 14 serological methods when available will play an important role in the epidemiology of covid-19 and in determining the immune status of asymptomatic patients but are unlikely to play any role in screening or for the diagnosis of early infections 14 67 68 however serology may be useful for confirming the diagnosis of covid-19 25 the ongoing unprecedented outbreak of covid-19 globally has emphasized the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of human coronavirus infections in order to limit the spread as well as to appropriately treat those patients who have a serious infection this commentary has addressed current issues regarding such testing for sars-cov-2 for example an np rather than op swab is recommended for early diagnosis or screening because it provides higher diagnostic yields is better tolerated by the patient and is safer for the operator an np swab can be combined with an op swab to increase sensitivity but requires twice the number of swabs should the np swabs become scarce self-collected saliva or nasal washes could be used as an alternative specimen type for epidemiological screening and for the worried well who are asymptomatic persons with no exposure history who wish to be tested just to be sure they are not infected np swabs would then be reserved for hospitalized patients those who test negative may need deep sputum or bal fluid samples collected the importance of repeated testing or the use of bronchoscopy in patients with severe illness should the first screening test be negative must be understood the role of rectal swabs in testing patients with late infection or as a test of infectivitycure is currently not well studied but needs urgent attention equally unappreciated is the need for broad screeningtesting with molecular testing andor serological testing in order to determine the true mortality rate as well as other epidemiological markers finally the importance of rapid development of integrated random-access point-of-care molecular devices for the accurate diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infections cannot be overemphasized these short-turnaround-time stat tests will be very important for real-time patient management and infection control decisions especially when other less infectious forms of pneumonia are present and respiratory isolate resources are scarce these assays are safe simple and fast and can be used in local clinics and hospitals that already have the needed instruments and that are responsible for identifying and treating such patients  suggested new breakpoints of

serologic tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and immunofluorescence assay ifa are available as commercial kits and have been used for various purposes including epidemiologic investigations evaluation of antibody kinetics and assessing feasibility of convalescent plasma infusion therapy 26 the manufacturers instructions provided relatively high cut-off values for positivity to warrant specificity which were derived from limited positive samples elisa igg euroimmun lbeck germany 4 mers patient samples and 500 negative controls 7 in previously conducted serologic studies cut-off values were differently applied depending on the purpose of serologic tests several epidemiologic studies applied low cut-off values to increase sensitivity of the test 3 6 while others followed the manufacturers instructions 2 4 also as not all confirmed mers-cov-infected patients mounted robust neutralization activity 2 the performance of serologic tests should be separately analyzed depending on the purposes of the tests predicting neutralization activity in mers-cov-infected patients and diagnosing mers-cov infection in epidemiologic surveillance to provide optimal cut-off values depending on the purposes of the tests we evaluated performance of various anti-mers-cov serologic tests using 138 serum samples of 49 mers-cov-infected patients and 219 serum samples of 219 rrt-pcr-negative mers-cov-exposed healthcare personnel hcp and patients the performance analysis included sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value and was conducted under two different purposes of serologic tests 1 prediction of neutralization activity in mers-cov-infected patients and 2 epidemiologic surveillance of mers-cov infections among mers-cov-exposed individuals plaque reduction neutralization test prnt and sputum real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr for mers-cov were used as gold standards for assessing neutralization activity and diagnosing mers-cov infection respectively mers-cov exposure dates and symptom onsets of collected serum samples were clearly identified owing to thorough contact investigation and monitoring of exposed individuals 8 to provide a common point of reference we used days post onset of illness dpoi assessing neutralization activity since symptom onset could be clearly identified among mers-cov-infected patients meanwhile as epidemiologic surveillances are usually conducted on the basis of exposure events we applied days post exposure dpex assessing diagnostic performance of serologic tests in epidemiologic surveillance to compare performances of serologic tests depending on serum collection time each test was evaluated at three different timepoints 1 regardless of serum collection time 2 after 14 dpoi or 21 dpex and 3 after 21 dpoi or 28 dpex during the 2015 korean mers outbreak we obtained 138 serum samples from 49 mers-cov infected patients study population included 42 patients who were managed at a 1950-bed tertiary care university hospital 8 9 and seven patients who donated sera for plasma infusion therapy or serologic testing mers-cov infections were confirmed on the basis of rrt-pcr assays targeting upstream of the e gene upe and the open-reading frame gene 1a orf1a 10 11 epidemiologic investigation data and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain exact exposure date and symptom onset one or two serum samples were collected per week of illness during hospitalization follow-up serum samples were obtained up to 6 months from symptom onset at an outpatient clinic sera of 219 rrt-pcr-negative mers-cov-exposed hcp and patients were used as negative control samples 3 collected samples were stored at 70 c for about three months before testing the institutional review board of samsung medical center approved the present study anti-mers-cov elisa igg and iga euroimmun lbeck germany were based on soluble mers-cov spike protein s1 domain expressed in hek-293 t cells 6 1214 sera were tested according to the manufacturers instructions with 1100 dilutions secondary detection was done with peroxidase-labeled anti-human igg and iga elisa igg was initially tested in all of the collected serum samples and other serologic tests including elisa iga ifa and prnt were selectively performed depending on elisa igg using optical density od ratio cut-off value of 02 and sputum rrt-pcr results table 1 since ifa igg was limitedly tested among an rrt-pcr-negative population diagnostic performance for epidemiologic surveillance of ifa igg could not be evaluated
 anti-mers-cov ifa igg and igm euroimmun were performed with slides carrying vero cells infected with full mers-cov 12 14 15 sera were tested according to the manufacturers instructions with 110 and 1100 dilutions for ifa igm and igg respectively for comparison of the performance of ifa igg with that of elisa igg 71 sera were selected for titration from 150 to 11000 dilutions including sera collected between 14 and 27 dpoi presumed window period of seroconversion 4 5 and sera of patients who were serially sampled at least four times table 1 mers-cov prnt was performed as previously described 12 14 pre-dilution before setting up the log2-dilution series was 110 defining 120 as the lowest possible significant titer for categorizing a sample as positive 12 cut-off values with optimal sensitivity and specificity were analyzed per 01 od ratio or each ifa intensity areas under the curve aucs were calculated using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve r-331 for windows rstudio boston ma usa was used for all statistical analyses the performance of serologic tests improved with delayed sampling time being maximized when sera collected after 21 dpoi were used fig 1a in predicting neutralization activity elisa igg and ifa igm tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 21 dpoi at cut-off values of od ratio 04 and weekly-positive ifa intensity respectively table 2 especially elisa igg showed 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity at this time point while elisa igg and ifa igm exhibited slightly lower performance area under the curve auc 1000 0996 and 0917 respectively meanwhile elisa iga showed optimal performance using sera collected after 14 dpoi at cut-off value of od ratio 02 detailed performance values depending on serum collection time and cut-off values are presented in supplementary tables 1 to 3 ifa igg showed optimal performance with cut-off value of 1500 dilutions and overall performance was not superior to elisa igg supplementary table 4

 in diagnosing mers-cov infection elisa igg elisa iga and ifa igm tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 28 dpex at cut-off value of od ratio 02 od ratio 02 and weakly-positive ifa intensity respectively table 3 most values of rrt-pcr-negative mers-cov-exposed individuals were under these cut-off values discriminating mers-cov-infected and non-infected individuals fig 2 overall elisa igg showed better performance than elisa iga or ifa igm for diagnosing mers-cov infection auc 0982 0914 and 0875 respectively when sera collected after 28 dpex were used performance of serologic tests improved with delayed sampling time being maximized when sera collected after 28 dpex were used fig 1b and supplementary tables 5 to 7 in addition the specificity of elisa igg elisa iga and ifa igm tests was 100 regardless of serum collection time at cut-off value of od ratio 05 od ratio 03 and ifa intensity 1 respectively

 neutralization testing is a gold standard method for detecting antiviral antibodies especially exhibiting virus-killing function however neutralization tests against mers-cov cannot be readily performed worldwide as it requires biosafety level 3 facilities skilled experts and carries a potential risk of infection 5 to reduce such risks and workloads previous anti-mers-cov serologic studies applied step-wise approaches using elisa and ifa which are relatively easy and safe to test 6 12 to make anti-mers-cov serologic tests more practical we assessed performance of elisa and ifa tests for two clinical purposes and suggested optimal cut-off values as previous cut-off values for positivity were provided for diagnosis of mers-cov infection 7 we firstly suggest cut-off values for predicting neutralization activity in the present analysis both elisa igg and iga excellently predicted neutralization activity using sera collected after 21 dpoi auc 1000 and 0996 respectively of note elisa igg showed 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity at this time point with od ratio cut-off value of 04 predicting neutralization activity is extremely important in selecting donors and recipients of convalescent plasma infusion therapy which is a potential treatment for mers-cov infection 2 in the present analysis even after 21 dpoi 195 841 supplementary table 1 of collected sera did not have neutralization activity which emphasizes importance of antibody testing before collecting convalescent plasma in addition measurement of neutralization activity is also important in selecting recipients and evaluating effect of convalescent plasma infusion using elsia tests with performance data from the present analysis evaluation of neutralization activity can be performed in the field of mers patient management without delay diagnosing mers-cov infections using anti-mers-cov serologic tests has been practically used for post-exposure epidemiologic studies or sero-prevalence investigations in endemic regions 3 6 12 16 to increase sensitivity of elisa as a screening test several epidemiologic studies applied low cut-off values of od ratio usually a three-fold value of negative controls elisa igg od ratios 02 to 03 depending on study sites 3 6 in the present analysis we demonstrated that an elisa igg cut-off value of od ratio 02 actually showed optimal performance with high specificity of 92 to 94 this is visually well demonstrated in fig 2 an elisa igg cut-off value of od ratio 02 optimally discriminated negative controls and symptomatic infections groups 1 to 3 while elisa iga and ifa igm show inferior performance differentiating negative controls and mild patients group 1 asymptomatic patients group 0 did not show any serologic responses which make serologic diagnosis inapplicable the manufacturers instructions provided a significantly higher break point for mers diagnosis to warrant specificity for elisa igg borderline od ratio cut-off of 0811 and positive 11 7 however we demonstrated that elisa igg exhibits 100 specificity from the cut-off value of od ratio 05 supplementary table 5 while previous cut-off value of od ratio 11 showed extremely low sensitivity of 348 therefore we suggest elisa igg od ratio 02 as a new break point for mers-cov diagnosis for general application while od ratio 05 can be applied for maximal specificity in addition we recommend taking at least a 28-day interval from mers-exposure to serum sampling for post-exposure serologic investigations to warrant seroconversion in our unpublished data seroconversion occurred around the third week of illness or the fourth week after exposure 18 dpoi in median ranged 1424 22 dpex in median ranged 1830 ko et al data under review although elisa igg showed slightly higher auc than ifa igg supplementary table 4 the number of ifa tested samples was not sufficient which limited comparison of performance between the two different methods however performance of elisa igg was at least not inferior to that of ifa igg which implies that additional confirmation by ifa after elisa screening is not mandatory in addition considering the cross-reactivity of the serologic tests to other coronaviruses 12 the performance for mers diagnosis could be affected by the local epidemiology of human coronavirus infections in conclusion in a performance analysis using 138 serum samples form 49 mers-cov-infected patients elisa igg showed optimal performance in predicting neutralization activity and diagnosing mers-cov infection at cut-off values of od ratio 04 and 02 respectively with this performance analysis anti-mers-cov serologic tests can be practically used in the field of mers management  serodiagnostics for severe acute

laura mazzola jilian sacks a sabine dittrich jesse papenburg   we searched the medline ovid database for articles on sars-cov-2 serologic assays the appendix available at annalsorg shows the search strategy additional studies were identified by hand-searching references of selected articles consulting international experts and searching covid-19 and sars-cov-2 preprints on medrxiv and biorxiv this search was last updated on 20 may 2020 whereas the utility of antibody detection tests for the diagnosis of active covid-19 is limited 8 serologic assays are crucial for documenting prior infection and the presence of antibodies which may indicate immunity table 110 shows potential use cases for sars-cov-2 antibody testing the interpretation of the results of antibody testing for sars-cov-2 figure can present challenges owing to uncertainty about 1 whether mild and asymptomatic cases mount a detectable humoral immune response 2 whether the detection of antibodies correlates with protective immunity 3 the duration of antibody response and anamnestic responses after infection and 4 the relative importance of the humoral cellular and innate responses of note infection prevalence in the population being tested must always be considered in patients with clinical features of covid-19 a highly specific test such as sars-cov-2 polymerase chain reaction pcr has a high positive predictive value for true infection conversely if testing asymptomatic individuals when the true seroprevalence of a population is only 5 an assay with a specificity of 95 would produce a false-positive rate of 50 low specificity is particularly problematic
in cases where incorrectly identifying an individual as immune could place them at significant riskfor instance if they were to enter settings with high risk for exposure without appropriate personal protective equipment the sensitivity of a serologic assay can be established by testing sera from patients who have been identified as infected on the basis of a reference standard however a single estimate of sensitivity to describe test performance can be difficult to interpret when samples are collected at different time points since infection sensitivity estimates will vary according to time since infection in the validation cohort early 7 days since symptom onset and mid-stage 8 to 14 days pcr-confirmed cases of covid-19 will have lower rates of seroconversion than in the later stage 14 days thus antibody tests will have lower sensitivity to detect infection in earlier phases likewise antibody responses may be more easily detectable in severe cases hospitalized patients than in mild or asymptomatic infections 11 establishing the analytic specificity of sars-cov-2 seroassays presents a challenge because of potential for cross-reactivity with antibodies to related coronaviruses 11 12 to address this test reactivity thresholds used to define a positive result can be adjusted to optimize the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity 13 with higher thresholds sensitivity decreases as cases with low serum antibody levels are categorized as negative but specificity improves as low amounts of nonspecific antibody are no longer considered positive physicochemical assay variables can also be modified so that less specific antibodies with less avidity for the antigen are excluded this also improves specificity at some expense to sensitivity tests that target igm which by its nature can be nonspecific will probably have
increased risk for false-positive results validation of the clinical specificity of a serologic assay requires sera from different types of sources in the case of covid-19 sera collected before the end of 2019 are presumed to be seronegative for sars-cov-2 14 the samples chosen should be representative of the population of interest in addition individuals known to have been infected with various common pathogens including other human coronaviruses but who could not have been infected with sars-cov-2 should be evaluated to demonstrate the absence of cross-reactivity finally patients with illnesses known to stimulate high levels of polyclonal antibodies such as epsteinbarr virus infection malaria or conditions associated with production of rheumatoid factor can be evaluated for cross-reactivity 1517 without these validations assay specificity will be difficult to establish
once a particular assay is shown to have high sensitivity and high specificity this assay can serve as a surrogate gold standard for the validation of other assays as well as a standard for quantitative assays to date most published sars-cov-2 serologic assay validations have classified patient sera according to sars-cov-2 pcr results 18 polymerase chain reaction assay is an imperfect comparator for sars-cov-2 diagnosis because of variable analytic performance across assays 19 and because pcr sensitivity depends on sample type quality of sampling and timing relative to illness onset 4 20 this can lead to unpredictable directions of bias for seroassay accuracy estimates there is an urgent need for validation studies to provide more detail on pcr comparators and on study populations especially regarding disease severity and timing in the illness course furthermore to enable a better understanding of the diagnostic accuracy of various sars-cov-2 serologic tests the development of reference
panels including seroconversion panels by using well-characterized sera is necessary only a subset of antibodies raised against a specific antigen have the property of neutralizing viral replication neutralization assays such as plaque reduction and microneutralization methods provide essential data for the validation of candidate diagnostic tests and to define correlates of protective immunity the primary drawback of functional assays of sars-cov-2 neutralization is that they can only be performed by experienced staff in a biosafety level bsl 3 laboratory owing to the need to culture live virus which increases complexity and cost thus efforts to circumvent these obstacles have converged on finding surrogates of traditional neutralization titers live pseudotyped viruses have been developed that incorporate the s protein of sars-cov-2 can be cultivated in bsl-2 conditions and express a reporter enzyme when infecting cells through binding to the ace2 receptor thereby allowing for automated quantification 27 such reporter virus systems would offer substantial advantages in terms of speed cost and scalability while providing a quasi-functional assessment of the host neutralizing antibody response 18 other groups are striving to create surrogates of neutralization that bypass the need for viral culture through the use of blocking elisa formats 28 for high-throughput and inexpensive after initial capital outlay screening in clinical laboratories relevant antigenic targets can be purified or synthesized and 1 or more can be incorporated into an elisa test platform specific antibodyantigen reactivity is detected by using enzyme conjugates that produce color changes or other detector labels that can be objectively measured 29 the elisas detect antibodies directed at the chosen antigen without regard for their ability to elicit viral neutralization thus interpretation of immune status from elisa results requires rigorous characterization of the assay with respect to a reference standard for the moment this work has not been done for sars-cov-2 furthermore universal standards for reporting are lacking some assays produce semiquantitative results others are qualitative and assays have variable test detection limits and reproducibility and use
different analytes igg igm iga or combinations thereof with unclear effect on performance 30 it is thus not surprising that estimates of elisa test sensitivity and specificity vary widely across assays and even within assays evaluated by different investigators table 23147 the lfas leverage the same capture agents as an elisa in a lateral flow strip format 48 the lateral flow format enables a simple and fast time to result 10 to 30 minutes but with tradeoffs in detection that is several-fold less sensitive than their elisa counterpart a higher cost per test and lower throughput 49 for lfas follow-up confirmatory testing is typically recommended most provide qualitative visual results subjectively interpreted by the operator the use of a small instrument reader can increase test sensitivity and may permit quantitative and more reproducible results 50 51 to enable community-based and home testing lfas should be paired with minimally invasive samples such as finger-prick or oral fluid or swabs and minimal sample processing these tests are ideal for near-patient testing and low infrastructure settings such as the lower levels of the public health system in low- and middle-income countries 52 where they have been used to effectively screen and triage cases of epidemic and nonepidemic diseases particularly where resources are constrained inexpensive lfas may be useful to expand diagnostic test capacity many sars-cov-2 lfa antibody tests are available however the performance of these tests is still under evaluation and their value needs to be carefully weighed depending on the use case a recent large study found heterogeneous and inconsistent results among 10 lfas and identified signal interpretation as a major obstacle 41 population-based seroepidemiologic studies are an important source of evidence about sars-cov-2 transmission dynamics and will be critical for informing interventions to mitigate the effects of the covid-19 pandemic 53 whereas reports of clinical cases identify persons with acute disease seroepidemiologic studies identify those who were infected previously including those who experienced mild disease or subclinical infections and thus may not be subject to biases due to health careseeking behavior and limitations on eligibility for testing during acute disease these assessments of seroprevalence overall and in specific groups can be used to estimate important characteristics of the pandemic 5456 serologic surveillance studies can also assess the accumulation of persons with antibody responses over time to estimate incidence of sars-cov-2
infection 57 58 and can track age- and jurisdiction-specific disease susceptibility and identify at-risk populations 59 utilizing standard protocols for the design and implementation of serologic studies 60 and making protocols publicly available can improve scientific rigor and ensure comparability across studies undertaken in different populations of note the who unity studies aim to combine worldwide seroepidemiologic study data 61 cross-sectional serologic surveillance studies are a key first step toward determining the proportion of a population that has been infected with sars-cov-2 when estimating age-specific seroprevalence is the primary aim the gold-standard study design is the conduct of appropriately powered cross-sectional age-stratified population-representative randomly sampled serologic studies in each population of interest this study design when implemented appropriately ensures that the estimates obtained are representative of the population of interest and minimizes the potential that the results may have common sources of bias 62 in addition many variations of this design are also valuable for estimating age-specific seroprevalence especially when statistical methods are used that can account for alternative design elements and sources of uncertainty 63 layering seroprevalence
surveys onto other existing observational or interventional studies or utilizing residual sera from blood donors or from routine lab tests can increase feasibility and timeliness of estimating seroprevalence at some risk to generalizability to determine sars-cov-2 seroincidence or the proportion of the population seroconverting over a certain time frame longitudinal studies can be conducted among cohorts of individuals who are at high risk for exposure such as health care workers or among those for whom little is known about the risk for infection such as children furthermore longitudinal serologic surveillance can be implemented to provide insight in situations where prevention and control measures are changing over time and to evaluate the impact of such measures on the incidence of infection studies on the dynamics of humoral responses over time also require longitudinal evaluation numerous other seroepidemiologic study designs can fill in gaps in our knowledge about sars-cov-2 for instance household- or workplace-based serologic studies can aid in the determination of secondary attack rates especially when the proportion of asymptomatic infections may be high in addition well-designed seroepidemiologic studies are critical for informing mathematical models and forecasting tools to guide prevention and control strategies a critical aspect in the interpretation of serologic tests is an understanding of the dynamic nature of the humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection a few studies have defined the kinetics of antibody formation in patients with disease ranging from mildly symptomatic to critically ill these studies have consistently shown that most patients seroconvert by 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and almost all patients have detectable antibodies by day 28 6 7 20 64 65 antibodies can be detected as early as 1 day after illness onset with peak igm and iga titers occurring in the ensuing 7 to 14 days and waning thereafter the igg response appears to peak simultaneously in some cases or slightly later in others 66 and plateaus between 15 and 21 days 6 in some cases igg titer declines significantly within weeks 67 some patients appear to have weak or undetectable seroconversion 44 66 illness severity probably affects antibody responses critically ill patients had a delayed but more robust formation of igm and igg in one study 7 antisars-cov-2 responses in subclinical infections have yet to be characterized finally the suitability of alternative specimen types to serum such as saliva or dried blood spots 68 69 must be established for sars-cov-2 serodiagnostics correlates of protection are empirically derived specific immune markers associated with protection against infection or disease 53 seropositivity is often a useful correlate for clinical immunity though cell-mediated immunity is known to be essential and antibody production is not the sole mechanistic contribution to protection 70 the relationship between seropositivity and immune protection has not yet been established for coronaviruses a recent report on 175 patients who recovered from covid-19 showed that nab titers were moderately correlated with antibodies binding to s protein domains 24 surprisingly 30 of patients developed only low titers of nabs after recovery with younger patients 15 to 39 years of age having significantly lower antisars-cov-2 and nab titers this suggest that innate and adaptive cellular immunity are also likely to play a significant role in viral clearance and immunity to coronaviruses 71 little is known regarding seropositivity and risk for reinfection to coronaviruses in a challenge study with hcov-229e healthy volunteers who had lower specific igg titers at baseline were more likely to develop clinically overt infection 72 after the challenge specific igg and nab peaked at 3 weeks and fell considerably at 12 weeks one year later 6 out of 9 previously infected participants became infected after a rechallenge though they were asymptomatic and the duration of viral shedding was shorter than during the first challengesuggesting at least partial protection induced by the first infection of note the immune response dynamics after sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov infection differ substantially from what was seen with hcov-229e challenge values for igg and nab peaked 4 months after sars-cov-1 and decreased after 16 months after mers-cov infection 86 of
patients had detectable igg and nabs for at least 34 months 11 evaluations of sars-cov-2 serologic assays must account for potential cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses including the 4 endemic human coronaviruses hku1 oc43 nl63 and 229e a systematic review of antibody-mediated immunity to coronaviruses found that studies of serologic responses to human coronavirus n proteins suggest cross-reactivity within human alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 and human betacoronaviruses oc43 and hku1 but not between human alpha- and betacoronaviruses 11 the available evidence suggests that natural infections with endemic coronaviruses produce little cross-reactivity to emerging coronaviruses sars-cov-1 and mers-cov regarding sars-cov-2 elisa using s1 protein epitopes several pilot studies report positive results with sera from patients with sars-cov-1 and a lack of significant cross-reactivity when using sera from small numbers of patients seropositive for the endemic human coronaviruses 18 44 data regarding sars-cov-2 elisa based on the n protein are more limited the specificity of 2 elisa and 10 lateral flow assays has also been assessed against 108 precovid-19 sera from us patients collected in july 2018 and ranged from 843 to 100 41 finally in keeping with these results a surrogate assay of sars-cov-2 viral neutralization tests was found to be highly specific among sera positive for endemic human coronaviruses antibodies but showed some degree of cross reactivity with sars-cov-1 positive sera 28 thus cross reactivity of sars-cov-2 serologic assays may be a concern in areas where sars-cov-1 and mers-cov circulated widely overall serologic tests based on s protein appear to distinguish between emerging and endemic coronaviruses assays based on the n protein can serve as a marker of recent infection but might be expected to cross react more with endemic coronaviruses convalescent plasma therapy as a means of providing passive immunity to susceptible individuals and as early therapy after infection has been used for many viral infections 73 this approach was used in a small number of patients with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov and has shown promise in a few case series of sars-cov-2 infection 7477 use of covid-19 convalescent plasma has been approved in several jurisdictions under the category of an emergency investigational new drug 78 as a general principle the efficacy of plasma therapy is a function of several factors including timing of plasma donation plasma obtained a few weeks after recovery during convalescence is considered more immunogenic with higher titers of polyclonal neutralizing antibodies dosage and timing of administration in relation to onset of disease in the recipient for covid-19 identifying optimal donors will prove to be an additional challenge given the heterogeneity in antibody titers during convalescence and the lack of an established correlation between specific antibody titers and clinical efficacy 79 as an example in the treatment of influenza plasma with high nab titers collected from a nonconvalescent general population did not show efficacy 80 81 suggesting that donor selection should not be based solely
on serologic titers eventually antibody derived from vaccinated donors may deserve further study serologic tests are essential to better understand the determinants of sars-cov-2 immunity and to guide vaccine development for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the s protein was shown to be the most important antigen leading to production of nabs and inhibition of viral entry into the host cells 82 since then s protein has been the major target for vaccine candidates previous experience using sars-cov-1 subunit vaccine based on the full-length s protein showed potent nab responses and protective immunity in animal models however some of these vaccines were also associated with a harmful immune enhancement as seen in vaccine candidates for dengue or respiratory syncytial virus leading to a potentially more severe disease in vaccinated individuals 83 antibody-dependent enhancement has also been seen among sars-cov-1infected macaques injected with antispike igg 84 for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s protein was shown to be the major immunodominant region subunit vaccines targeting rbd specifically elicited high nab titers but were not associated with immune enhancement 82 85 in sars-cov-2infected patients among the binding antibodies to the different regions of the s protein s1 s2 rbd rbd-specific igg correlated best with nabs suggesting that rbd is be a promising target for sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates 24 however because rbd is the most variable region of the genome 86 there is still a theoretical risk for immunologic escape as well as immune enhancement development 87 the n protein a more conserved region of the genome has been of interest for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccine candidates and was thought to be at lower risk for immune enhancement however it was not shown to elicit nabs 82 the role of the n protein in sars-cov-2 immune response is still unknown in conclusion the covid-19 pandemic has revealed several gaps in our diagnostic arsenal and is highlighting the essential role of serodiagnostics as part of our public health response with the use of carefully validated assays appropriately designed serologic studies will help characterize transmission dynamics and refine disease burden estimates urgent scientific research is needed to link specific serologic variables with immunity against sars-cov-2  an

immunofluorescence assay ifa enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa and passive hemagglutination test by use of antigenically related tgev and ccv have been widely applied for detection of anti-coronavirus antibody in cats 14 16 23  in recent years several feline coronavirus isolates cultivable in cell cultures have led to the development of homologous serologic assays 4 24 25 26 27  the purpose in the present report is to evaluate elisa that uses ccv-infected cells as antigens for coronavirus serology in cats canine coronavirus grows very efficiently in feline cells and the use of such virus-infected cultured cells saves laborious and expensive virus purification a canine coronavirus designated 5821 strain was obtained from dr masayuki ajiki kyoto-biken lab kyoto this strain was originally isolated from feces of a puppy died of enteritides manifesting diarrhea and vomiting in 1984 and had been previously passaged 8 times in primary dog kidney dkp cells the virus was further cultured twice in dkp cells and once in crandell feline kidney crfkatcc ccl-94 cells in this laboratory and stored at -80c as a stock virus infective titer of the stock virus was determined by the plaque assay described previously 23  the crfk cells were used for the plaque assay micro-neutralization test mnt and elisa they were cultured in eagles minimal essential medium eagles mem nissui pharm co ltd japan containing 10 nu-serum nus collaborative res inc usa 10 tryptose phosphate broth difco lab usa and antibiotics  twenty-three sera and 5 ascites were collected from cats clinicopathologically suspected as fip one serum 3 ascites and 2 thoracic fluids and 2 ascites which were from the pathologically confirmed spontaneous fip cases and possessed specific ifa antibodies against the yayoi strain of fipv 28 as listed in table 1  were obtained from the department of veterinary pathology university of tokyo tokyo and the department of veterinary microbiology iwate university iwate respectively two litters of conventional kittens which were about 6-to 8-week old clinically normal and seronegative were used in the experiments each of 5 littermate kittens was orally administered with 45 x 10 6 plaque forming units pfu of the virus four kittens of another litter received 75 x 105 pfu orally and one intramuscular dose of the triple viral vaccine panagen fvrc-p pitman-moore inc usa simultaneously each of them had another vaccine booster injection 3 weeks later the vaccine contained a mixture of inactivated feline panleukopenia virus and attenuated feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus which were prepared in feline cell cultures blood samples were taken from all kittens at appropriate intervals for a 7-week period neutralizing antibody titer was determined by the method of mnt described elsewhere 23  more than 14 of the titer was regarded as positive the crfk cells 8  105ml of cell density in the eagles mem10nus were mixed with an equal volume of the stock virus to be at 005 of multiplicity of infection and 100 pl of the mixture was dispensed into each well of a 96-well flat bottomed polystyrene plates corning glass works usa as described previously 23  after 48-h incubation in a humidified chamber containing 5 co2 the cells were fixed with methanol containing 03 h202 for 30 min the wells were then saturated with 2501 of blocking buffer which consisted of 3 gelatin in dulbeccos phosphate buffered saline solution pbs after 1 h at room temperature the blocking buffer was removed from the wells and to which 501 amounts of the test sample serially diluted in pbs containing 1 gelatin and 005 tween 20 gtpbs was added the plate was incubated at 37c for 1 h and was washed by emptying filling with 005 tween 20 in pbs from a wash-bottle and leaving for 3 min this process was repeated 3 times then 501 of freshly diluted 1400 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-cat igg goat serum cooper biomedical inc usa in gtpbs was added to each well and kept for 1 h at room temperature after which plates were washed the result was read spectrophotometrically 405 nm by an elisa reader mtp-02 type corona electric co ltd japan 30 min after the addition of abts substrate 22-azino-di3-ethyl benzylthiazoline sulfonic acid-6-disodium salt polysciences inc usa to wells the test sample was applied to the mock-infected normal crfk cells in parallel with the virus-infected cells by the same manner optical density od values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen the corrected od value the elisa titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which the corrected od value exceeded 005 as shown in fig 1 in which typical titration curves for positive and negative sera were drawn the elisa titer of more than 1  10 was regarded as positive all cats manifested no clinical signs throughout the experiments rapid rise in both mnt and elisa antibody titers was detected in all cats administered with ccv on the 8th day as shown in fig 2  both antibody titers gradually rose until the 30th day and declined thereafter in parallel with each other the geometric means of elisa titers were about 4-10 times higher than those of mnt titers although elisa titers of pre-administration sera were regarded to be less than 110 by the corrected od value all had low reactivities 120-150 to the mock-infected normal crfk cell antigen as shown in fig 3  the reactivities against the normal crfk cell antigens of the cats with no vaccination did not change so drastically as those of the cats administered with the parenteral vaccine after the vaccination the sera became to be reactive with not only the ccv-infected cell antigen but also the mock-infected cell antigen to comparable degrees however the od values of each dilution of serum against the infected cell antigen were so higher than those against the control cell antigen as to generate the specific values relationships between mnt and elisa titers of 28 samples from the cats suspected as fip were shown in fig 4  twenty-three of them 821 were anti-ccv mnt antibody-positive with titers of 14 to 1512000 and anti-ccv elisa antibody with titers of 110 to 1256000 were detected in all of them the samples with high mnt titers 1256 or more n  9 had proportionally high titers of elisa antibody as well the calculated correlation coefficient between both mnt and elisa titers of them was found to be r 0907 but significantly high elisa antibody titers 12560 or more were detected in 12 out of the other 19 samples possessing low or negative mnt titers 1  64 or less table 1 shows mnt and elisa antibody titers against ccv of the serum and i  i  i  i  i i  i  i  1  i  i  0  10  20

against ccv were correlative with the ifa titers against homologous fipv however the elisa titers were generally lower than the ifa titers clinical diagnosis of fip is generally performed by evaluation of results of physical and hematological examinations serum electropholetic analysis and anti-coronavirus antibody testing moreover biopsy in the living animal or necropsy after death are considered to be the most definitive diagnosis of fip the serologic tests are however only an aid to diagnosis because anti-coronavirus antibody can be detected not only in fip cats but also in cats with other diseases and even in healthy animals 8 18 19 22 28 29  the tests used routinely for detection of anti-coronavirus antibodies in felines are ifa or elisa in which tgev or ccv have been popularly used as the target antigen 17q9 21  the results in the present study indicate that the elisa using ccv-infected cultured cells as antigens saves laborious purified viral antigen preparation and it detects anti-coronavirus antibodies in cat sera more extensively than the mnt using ccv and as efficiently as ifa using homologous fipv however the elisa titers were generally lower than those obtained by the ifa as shown in table 1  this may result from qualitical differences of the substrate antigens ie heterologous or homologous coronaviruses for cat applied in the tests as reported by others 27  in the histochemical serological assays such as elisa and 1fa non-specific binding both  globulin associated and non- globulin associated of serum samples to the antigen preparations is often an additional problem it has been described that most but not all of false-positive reactions are attributable to recent vaccination 17 27 30 31  some kinds of cell culture vaccines prepared for use in cats have been commonly utilized in japan as well antibodies against vaccine ingredients other than desired viral antigens especially serum components in a tissue culture-derived vaccine may be elicited in cats after parenteral injection and they react with antigenically similar components presented in the antigen preparations of serologic tests therefore serum samples should be tested in parallel against negative antigen controls and results are adjusted accordingly as in kinetics-based elisa described by barlough et al 17  in the present study presumably because whole cultured-cell antigens were used all cat sera showed a variety of reactivities to the mock-infected normal crfk cell antigens as well and it was indispensable for generating the coronavirus-specific activity that the od values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen some in vivo subtle antigenic differences among fipv fecv and other heterologous coronaviruses doses have been described 4 32 33 34 35  although recently developed competitive elisa using type-specific mabs may prove useful in distinguishing cats which are infected with virulent fipv from cats infected with avirulent feline coronaviruses 36  none of the serologic assays routinely used has been specific enough to discern the virus to which a cat had been exposed 9 26 27  the elisa using ccv-infected cultured cells in the present report does not specifically determine the type of coronavirus exposure in cats but the results indicate that it is routinely applicable as a very simple and easy serologic test for anti-coronavirus antibody detection in cats  covid-19 current trends in invitro diagnostics r arun krishnan rhema elizabeth thomas ajaikumar sukumaran jofy paul k d vasudevan m   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is the latest pandemic gaoling the humanity having very high spreading rate and approximately 56 of mortality worldwide this novel beta coronavirus is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense rna virus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 genome structure comprises single stranded rna with nucleocapsid protein which are enclosed by membrane proteins envelope proteins and spike glycoproteins 1 fig 1 as a coronavirus the sars-cov-2 has high similarity with other viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov 2 the entry of the novel coronavirus to host is through the interaction between the densely glycosylated spike proteins to the receptors on host cell membrane the spike glycoprotein is a trimeric class i fusion protein consisting s1 and s2 domains 3 it is reported that there is 55 similarity in s1 domain of spike glycoproteins among sars-cov-2 and sars-cov and 91 similarity in case of s2 domain it is evident that the sars-cov-2 can infect the human respiratory epithelial cells through interaction of spike protein with the human ace2 receptor 4 the coronaviruses are large rna viruses 65125 nm in diameter come under the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order normally the coronavirus genome contains six open reading frame orfs which encodes for the structural as well as accessory proteins in the virus the nucleocapsid protein n-protein in the coronavirus binds to rna genome and forms a capsid around the enclosed nucleic acid the function of n-protein includes the interaction with membrane protein during viral assembly assists in rna synthesisfolding and affects host cell responses including cell cycle and translation the structural and accessory proteins are essential for viral replication genome maintenance and pathogenesis of the virus 5  at present the most widely used approved test for the diagnosis of covid-19 is the polymerase chain reaction pcr two different strategies are in use for pcr based assays the reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr and the loop mediated isothermal amplification pcr lamp pcr both methods offer high sensitivity 8590 and specificity for the covid-19 diagnosis as the methods are focusing on direct amplification of the virus genetic material the rt-pcr is quantitative in nature whereas the lamp pcr is qualitative as compared to rt-pcr lamp pcr will be more cost effective and less time consuming high throughput screening is another nucleic acid detection technology it is costly and has high equipment dependency making it less widely used even though the aforementioned methods can offer nearly 90 accurate result the improper sample collection handling and transportation may lead to false negative results obviously decreasing the sensitivity of the assay the rt-pcr is the most common and effective method used in the market to detect sars-cov-2 in rt-pcr reverse transcriptase converts virus rna into cdna following amplification into millions of copies of dna using a set of specific primers and probes the amplification taking place in 3 steps 1 denaturation 2 annealing and 3 elongation these three steps take place at 95 c for 30 s 50 for 30 s and 72 c for 60 s respectively the primers target and amplify different regions for sars-cov-2 such as nucleocapsid protein n gene envelope protein e gene and orf1ab gene regions which can be determined within the same cycle and separately for confirmatory testing 6 the turnaround time for sample analyses is 2535 h one-step rt-pcr assay to detect e gene and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene regions of sars-cov-2 has been developed by tib-molbiol 7 predominantly upper respiratory samples including nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs are recommended for analysis there are many breakthrough assays developed by various ivd manufacturers including abbott bosch and cepheid where a specific gene of sars-cov-2 is detected within few minutes although rt-pcr is the most widely used confirmatory test for covid-19 this technique is not robust and can only be performed by skilled analysts due to various biological safety hazards making sample detection cumbersome in many cases 8 even though the rt-pcr is a robust technology there are many factors contributing to false-positive and false-negative results mutations in primers targeting virus genome can lead to false negative results laboratory practices and safety procedures including collection transportation and handling also contribute to false negative results 9 the sampling timing and optimum sample types play significant role in obtaining highly sensitive and highly specific results 10 in most pcr assays two different regions of genes are targeted hence the result interpretation will be positive negative or inconclusive if both genes are amplified the result is positive if only one gene is positive that is called inconclusive and negative could be a false negative so inconclusive and negative persons should be treated as doubtful the efforts on minimizing length of the entire pcr process and practice of isothermal amplification has resulted in the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification the lamp is a highly specific isothermal amplification technique with an analytical limit of detection of 75 copies per l in lamp conversion of rna to dna is followed by amplification of sample genome using 46 primers forward inner primer forward outer primer reverse inner primer and reverse outer primer targeting different regions of the dna 11 the lamp has several advantages over rt-pcr it is considered to be more user friendly with easy detection speed and less background signal when compared to rt-pcr in addition to its speed lamp shows high level of specificity and high amplification efficiency than rt-pcr 12 the recently developed chitra gene lamp-n by sree chitra thirunal medical institute and technology in collaboration with agappe diagnostics ltd detects two different regions of n gene the turnaround time of 20 min for the analysis of 30 samples is a remarkable achievement however stringent evaluations on commercial lamp kits are needed for accuracy check and processing of large samples is an impetus for covid-19 testing apart from rt-pcr and lamp united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc approved one-step real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr to quantitatively detect viral particles in more than 90 samples within 45 min 13 recently specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking sherlock that allows multiplexed portable and ultra-sensitive detection of rna is a detection strategy used to combat sars-cov-2 cas13a ribonucleases used for rna sensing binds to amplified rna which when activated cleaves fluorophore-quencher probes emitting fluorescence sherlock has previously been used to detect clinical samples for zika virus 14 nevertheless there is a need for further optimisation of this technique in larger samples to achieve large scale evaluation of sars-cov-2 though the rrt-pcr is considered as the gold standard in the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 it has own limitations as a pandemic screening and isolation of the infected patients is the only way to reduce the spread of covid-19 in rt-pcr the testing directly look for the presence of viral dna but serological tests detect the presence of antibodiesantigens in human blood against the covid-19 hence rt-pcr will give the positive results in 37 days of infection but serological test will take 714 days to give positive results the test cost and testing time of pcr based assays inevitably demands the development of rapid serology tests 1517 several immunoassays are developed by various ivd companies for detecting covid-19 infection in serum plasma and whole blood among these strategies lateral flow immunoassays elisa and chemiluminescence are most promising approaches the limitation of rrt-pcr to detect covid-19 past infection and the progress of the disease increases the importance of serological assays the serological tests can detect both active and past infections if the tests are performed within the correct time frame after the onset of the disease in case of antibody detection assay both igg and igm antibodies against the covid-19 are the target analytes where igm appears in blood within a week of time and igg expression will take more than 10 days apart from antibody detection antigen detection against spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein is also under development which offers early detection of covid-19 infection in case of rt-pcr one of the important reasons for false negative results is improper sampling throat swab and transport whereas the sample of choice for serological test is serumplasmawhole blood which are easy to handle and transport serological tests like lfia for antigenantibody detection can be used as a rapid test or a point of care testing which offers quick screening of the patients with limited expertise 18 detecting antibody titre is important for convalescent plasma therapy and the development of vaccines for covid-19 apart from that serological testing would also provide valuable information regarding the course and degree of immune response as well as the durability of immunity in both infected individuals and participants in the vaccine clinical trials 19 the lfia can be utilized as a preliminary testing tool for covid-19 in case of community spread or in mass population screening at present the covid-19 iggigm antibody evaluation kits based on lfia is widely available in market upon covid-19 infection the igm and igg antibodies will start to develop in our body from 710 days and 1420 days respectively though igm can be detected earlier it also decreases and disappears earlier but igg can persist for a long time after the infection even though the antibody test kits are reliable for preliminary screening the test cannot be used as a confirmatory test because of non-specific interaction of antibodies and other proteins in the blood with capture and detector molecules in the membrane which may results in false positive or false negative results 20 the main advantages of lfia are that it can be used as a rapid poc test and it can be detected using finger-pricked blood or serumplasma it does not require any instruments or expertise staff for carrying out the test and it gives result in 530 min 21 the lfia antibody test for covid-19 can also be considered as a prognostic tool there by provides information about the immune status of the patient mostly the lfia results are qualitative but can be made quantitative by the use of customized color readers currently covid-19 antigen lfia test is under development which will offer more sensitive and specific result for covid-19 diagnosis and will detect the viral antigen in 3 days of infection 22 the elisa and clia platforms are widely using serology techniques for the quantitative detection of specific antigen or antibody in the samples zhang et al have developed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of covid-19 igm and igg antibody from serum sample sars-cov-2 rp3 nucleocapsid protein is adsorbed on the surface of a 96 well plate as capture molecule and anti-igg antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase is used as the detector molecule 23 manual elisa kits for detecting covid-19 have been developed by ivd manufactures like ibl international drg diagnostics gmbh epitope diagnostics and euroimmun for detecting the igg and igm antibodies developed in response to covid-19 infection 24 elisa and clia based covid-19 antigen detection kits are under development by ivd manufacturers worldwide automated clia method can also detect igg and igm antibody in serum or plasma the advantages of automated clia analyzers compared to rapid lfia tests is the very high throughput of samples and the ability to detect other biomarkers like c- reactive protein simultaneously 22 dz-lite sars-cov-2 clia developed by diazyme usa and maglumi clia developed by snibe china are chemiluminescent analyzers which can detect igg and igm antibodies of covid-19 besides the aforementioned specific tests certain routine biochemical and haematological tests show abnormal results in covid 19 patients upon covid-19 infection the level of prothrombin time lactate dehydrogenase ldh d-dimer alanine transaminase alt c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and creatine kinase are elevated 25 there is a marked lymphopenia with depletion of cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes in the early phase of the disease as the disease progress patients show higher levels of interleukin-2 il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factorgcsf interferon gamma-induced protein monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein alpha and tumour necrosis factor- tnf- its also noted that patients in intensive care show significant increase in amylase and d-dimer and in case of non survivors there is a marked elevation in the level of ferritin blood urea neutrophil count and d-dimer and creatinine levels but procalcitonin pct is not elevated in covid 19 so procalcitonin level can be used for the differential diagnosis of covid 19 from bacterial pneumonia 26 27 the level of crp starts to rise at the time of mild pneumonia and reaches peak at severe pneumonia the crp is also used as a marker of inflammation and the rise correlates with the level of inflammation regardless of the factors such as age sex and physical condition it is reported that the crp levels are positively correlated with lung lesions in early stage of covid 19 cases and can be used as a key indicator for disease monitoring 28 29 the nucleic acid based diagnostics methods and serological assays described above are serving as strong diagnostics tools for the covid-19 diagnosis the assurance of quality of developed diagnostics kits is having prime importance at this scenario even though recently many developments happened in the field of serological diagnosis for covid-19 still there are many concerns regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assays the complexity cost effectiveness and limitations of nucleic acid based diagnostic tools impetus the innovative development of well standardized high sensitive specific and low cost serological assays for covid-19 diagnosis  analysis of serologic cross-reactivity between common human coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 using coronavirus antigen microarray saahir khan rie nakajima aarti jain rafael de assis ramiro al jasinskas joshua obiero m oluwasanmi adenaiye sheldon tai filbert hong donald milton k huw davies philip felgner l   the 2019 novel coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 originating in wuhan china has become a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates up to 2 of confirmed cases the current case definition for confirmed covid-19 due to sarscov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk however this case definition likely underestimates the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested and testing by pcr of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens is unlikely to be 100 sensitive in detecting subclinical infection widespread testing within the united states is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories therefore the true prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection is currently unknown and the sensitivity of pcr to detect infection is also unknown serology can play an important role in defining both the prevalence of and sensitivity of pcr for sars-cov-2 infection particularly for subclinical infection this point is demonstrated by analogy with influenza virus for which a meta-analysis of available literature measured the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by pcr as approximately 16 while the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by seroconversion was measured as approximately 751 the seroprevalence of common human coronaviruses is known to increase throughout childhood to near 100 by adolescence2 thus any serologic methodology to estimate prevalence of sars-cov-2 needs to identify and rule out cross-reactivity with these common human coronavirus strains one challenge in applying serology to sars-cov-2 is that the choice of antigen and choice of assay is less well defined for coronavirus than more well studied viruses such as influenza however prior approaches to serologic detection of infection with emerging coronaviruses including sars and mers have focused on the s1 domain of the spike s glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid n protein which are considered the immunodominant antigens for these viruses3 in particular the s1 domain is strain-specific while the n protein shows cross-reactivity across strains the assay methodologies used for serologic detection of coronavirus infection include binding and neutralization assays these methodologies have been shown to be well correlated4 however neutralization assays require viral culture which must be performed in high-level biosafety containment units for emerging coronaviruses with high epidemic potential such as sars-cov-2 conversely binding assays such as elisa can be readily performed with widely available reagents and equipment so are field deployable and suitable for point of care testing the protein microarray methodology has been widely used to simultaneously perform binding assays against hundreds of antigens printed onto a nitrocellulose-coated slide for detection of multiple antibody isotypes5 this methodology was recently demonstrated for simultaneous measurement of igg and iga antibodies against over 250 antigens from diverse strains and subtypes of influenza6 this methodology has previously been applied to detect antibodies against the s1 domains of sars and mers coronaviruses7 the blood specimens used in this study were collected for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in an eastern university were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection ari cases using questionnaires and rt-qpcr so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections built environment and immunologic phenotypes8 from among de-identified blood specimens for which future research use authorization was obtained five specimens that showed high igg reactivity against human coronaviruses in the larger study were chosen for validation of the coronavirus antigen microarray the coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or hek-293 cells see tables 13 these antigens were provided by sino biological inc wayne pa as either catalog products or service products the antigens were printed onto microarrays probed with human sera and analyzed as previously described figure 16910 briefly lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 01 mgml in phosphate-buffered saline pbs with 0001 tween-20 t-pbs and then printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides from grace bio labs gbl bend or using an omnigrid 100 microarray printer genemachines the microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1100 in 1x gvs fast blocking buffer fischer scientific overnight at 4c washed with t-tbs buffer 20 mm tris-hcl 150 mm nacl 005 tween-20 in ddh2o adjusted to ph 75 and filtered 3 times for 5 minutes each labeled with secondary antibodies to human igg conjugated to quantum dot fluorophore for 2 hours at room temperature and then washed with t-tbs 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried the slides were imaged using arraycam imager grace bio labs bend or to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysis descriptive statistics were used to summarize the igg reactivity as measured by mean fluorescence across antigen replicates t-test or f-test were used to test for the mean differences in continuous variables across infection groups all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 351 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria overall the 5 sera tested on the coronavirus antigen microarray all showed high igg seroreactivity to antigens from common human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses with known seasonal circulation versus low igg seroreactivity to antigens from epidemic viruses that were not circulating at time of collection figure 2 specifically 4 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity across the 4 common human coronaviruses while all of the sera showed low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to rsv and parainfluenza viruses while 3 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to adenoviruses for influenza all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to h1n1 and h3n2 influenza a and influenza b strains but low igg seroreactivity to h5n1 and h7n9 influenza a strains with respect to specific antigens the s1 domain of the spike protein including the receptor-binding domain rbd demonstrates very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses whereas the s2 domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein np show low-level cross-reactivity between these coronavirus subtypes similarly the head domain of influenza hemagglutinin ha1 is not cross-reactive between seasonal and avian influenza strains whereas the stalk domain ha2 is cross-reactive between influenza virus subgroups as seen between h1n1 and h5n1 influenza viruses this pilot study yields several insights into cross-reactivity of common human coronavirus antibodies for sars-cov-2 antigens the antibodies to the s1 and rbd domains of spike protein are highly subtype-specific consistent with the high variability in these sequences between different human coronaviruses conversely the s2 domain of spike protein and np protein are more cross-reactive consistent with these sequences being highly conserved across coronaviruses sars-cov-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to s2 domain and np protein in most people indicating that these antibodies are likely not protective whereas antibodies to s1 and rbd domains are more likely to be protective this observation favors a vaccination strategy based on s1 or rbd domains of spike protein over a vaccination strategy that also includes s2 domain or np protein in addition s1 and rbd domains are more likely to generate subtype-specific serologic tests for population surveillance studies in addition a key unexplained finding during the sars-cov-2 epidemic has been the low incidence of infection in children aged 15 and younger this observation generates two related hypotheses adults may have pre-existing antibodies against antigenically distinct coronaviruses that produce an ineffective humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection antibody-dependent enhancement as demonstrated for dengue virus or children younger than 15 may have initially encountered a coronavirus that is more closely related to sars-cov-2 so are more protected against this infection immunologic imprinting or original antigenic sin as demonstrated for influenza virus both of these hypotheses would be informed by comparing the level of cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies in pediatric and adult cohorts and correlating these antibodies with incidence of severe disease a coronavirus antigen microarray has been constructed with antigens from epidemic coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 and common human coronaviruses in addition to other common respiratory viruses a pilot study of 5 nave human sera shows high igg seroreactivity to common human coronaviruses but low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2 with some cross-reactivity seen for s2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein further studies are needed including with sars-cov-2 convalescent sera to fully realize the potential of this novel methodology to characterize the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 and the impact of pre-existing cross-reactive

other times infections occurred sporadically all age groups were involved especially the very young rises in titer by cf and by hal tests frequently did not occur together in the same individual agreement between the two tests was better in 1966 and 1969 than in the other years a portion of the paired specimens showing rises in cf and or hal titer was tested by neutralization rises in neutralizing antibody were usually found in pairs collected in 1966 and 1969 but not in those collected in 1967 and 1968 the infecting viruses in 1966 and 1969 thus appeared more closely related to oc43 than did those in 1967 and 1968  coronaviruses are significantly involved in respiratory infections of man especially in those occurring in the colder months of the year 1 2 3 4  however neither the total number of different coronaviruses nor their relative importance is known understanding of the behavior of these viruses has been hampered greatly by the difficulties in propagation encountered in the laboratory only one coronavirus 229e can be isolated in cell culture and this is difficult 5  a major contribution has been the adaptation of viruses originally isolated in organ culture to animals or cell cultures 6 7  several serologic tests have thus been made possible and infections can now be identified by rise in antibody titer 8 9  as part of the study of respiratory infections in tecumseh michigan specimens of blood were collected on a regular basis from families under surveillance 10  by testing of specimens collected in early 1967 a large-scale outbreak of infection with coronavirus 229e was detected 11  all segments of the population were involved and infection was significantly associated with respi-ratory illness specimens collected over four years have now been tested for infection with coronavirus oc43 the present report describes the occurrence of coronavirus infections during this period as determined by different serologic techniques population studied and processing of specimens details of the surveillance methods used in tecumseh have been described 12  families for study were selected randomly from those with children whose parents were under 46 years of age each family was followed for one year specimens were obtained for isolation of virus when a respiratory illness was reported within two days of onset 13  samples of blood were collected at time of recruitment six months later and at the end of the year of surveillance 10  because recruitment of families was staggered specimens of blood were collected during all months of the year blood was drawn by venipuncture from individuals of approximately five years of age and older and the specimens of serum were stored at -20 c the specimens were collected from younger children on filter paper disks by finger stick at least four disks were obtained at one time and they were dried and stored at 4 c until use for cf and hal tests two disks were placed in 05 ml of veronal-buflered saline and the blood was eluted for 18 hr at 4 c thereafter the fluid was completely expressed from the disks and inactivated at 56 c for 30 min the eluate was centrifuged for 1 hr at 650 g and the supernatant was considered to represent a 14 dilution the specimens of serum were inactivated at 56 c for 30 min before dilution for cf hal or neutralization tests a ntigens used oc43 antigen was prepared from a mouse brain-adapted strain obtained through the courtesy of mr h s kaye center for disease control the seed was propagated by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice antigen was prepared as a 10 suspension in phosphatebuffered saline for hal tests and in tryptose-phosphate broth for neutralization tests for cf tests antigen was prepared as a 20 suspension in veronal-buffered saline the identity of each pool of virus was confirmed by cf with a homologous and a hyperimmune antiserum to murine hepatitis virus the seed of 229e virus was originally obtained from dr dorothy hamre and was passed serially in wi-38 cell culture antigen for cf tests was prepared by inoculation of wi-38 bottles or tubes with undiluted virus after incubation for 34-38 hr at 33 c the cultures were frozen and thawed three times fluids were centrifuged and the supernatant was used as antigen 11  serologic tests cf and hal tests were performed on all specimens of serum collected from members of 269 families these families were selected randomly from within each of the four years of study so that all periods would be represented the standard cf test was performed by a microplate technique with sheep erythrocytes 4 units of antigen and 18 units of complement the hal test was performed in microplates by the method of kaye et al 8  sera were serially diluted in phosphate buffered saline from the initial 1 4 dilution and 4 units of antigen were added after incubation for 30 min at 24 c 04 chick erythrocytes were added the test was read after incubation for an additional 1 hr at 24 c for both cf and hal all sera from the same individual were tested simultaneously a significant rise in titer was considered to have occurred if antibody appeared in a 1 8 dilution when prior specimens did not have demonstrable antibody at a 1 4 dilution a fourfold rise from a previous antibody titer was also considered significant approximately 40 of serum pairs demonstrating a significant rise in antibody titer by cf and hal were also tested by neutralization 9  the neutralization tests were performed in cultures of bs-c-1 cells cells were grown in eagles minimal essential medium mem made in hanks salts with 10 fetal bovine serum before use the cultures were washed three times with balanced salt solution and they were maintained on serum-free mem in earles salts virus was used at a dose of 100-320 tcid5001 ml after inactivation at 56 c for 30 min the sera were serially diluted to 03 ml of diluted sera 03 ml of the appropriate dilution of virus was added and the mixture was incubated at 24 c for 1 hr thereafter 02 ml of each mixture of serum and virus was inoculated into each of two cell-culture tubes the tubes were placed in a roller drum and incubated at 33 c after four days rat erythrocytes were washed three times and 02 ml of a 04 solution was added to each cell-culture tube tubes were examined microscopically after 45 min at 24 c and end points were determined based on the presence of virus-specific hemadsorption all specimens of serum collected from members of 269 families were studied by cf and hal for rise in titer of antibody to coronavirus oc43 these specimens had been collected from november 1965 to june 1969 in nearly all cases three specimens were obtained from each individual during each period of surveillance to determine the temporal occurrence of infection with oc43related viruses the three specimens collected from each person were divided into two component pairs each spanning a six-month period the time of each pair was identified by the month of collection of the second serum of that pair results of the serologic tests are shown in figure 1 rises in cf and hal titers frequently were independent of each other therefore each rise was counted without regard to the presence or absence of the other and is indicated as a separate curve in the figure bars indicate the percentage of total specimens tested in which the rises in titer by cf and hal occurred together it has been reported that the principal periods of transmission of coronavirus are in the winter and early spring 2 3  this pattern could be seen when the cf and hal curves for oc43 were examined frequent infections were detected by cf and hal in sera collected during the six- as one means of exploring the divergence in serologic results results are given in table 1 the overall rate of infection for each age group was calculated by determining the total number of individuals who showed a rise in antibody titer by cf andor hal the proportion of these infected individuals who had a rise in cf antibody was then calculated as was the proportion of infected individuals with a rise in hal antibody since the intent was determination of the relative frequency of rise in titer detected by each test persons with increases in both cf and hal titer were counted in both categories as shown in table 1 age did not appear to be a factor in determining the type of response at all ages below 40 years rises in titer were more frequently detected by hal than by cf but the difference was often not great only among individuals 40 years and older was this pattern reversed slightly the total rates of infection table 1 fell gradually as age increased but not as precipitously as with other respiratory pathogens  10 13  a high annual rate of infection was observed among all adults studied study of specificity of antibody response agreement between the hal and cf tests was better in the first part of 1966 and in early 1969 than at other times including the peak of infections in 1968 it seemed possible that agents similar to oc43 might have been responsible for the 1966 and 1969 outbreaks and more distantly related agents for activity at other times such a hypothesis could be tested by evaluation of the specificity of observed rises in titer through use of the recently described neutralization test 9  approximately thereafter the rates dropped showed a suggestion of an increase in march-april 1967 the period of the 229e outbreak 11  and then remained low until march-april 1968 this peak of infection was detected by both serologic tests with the rate by cf twice that by hal after this point the rates dropped only to peak in 1969 again in march-april during this outbreak rates of incidence were very high with considerably more infections detected by hal than by cf during the four years studied 156 paired specimens showed a rise in titer by cf andor hal of these only 37 237 had a rise in titer by both techniques this divergence in serologic results which has been noted in previous studies of oc43 virus 4  was not uniformly spread over the full period as shown by the relative height of the bars in figure 1  agreement between the two serologic tests was an infrequent occurrence except in may-june 1966 and again in 1969 during these periods the percentage of positive paired specimens in which the rises occurred together was 392  but in the rest of the four years it was 98 even during march-april 1968 when a peak of infections occurred there was still little correlation between the two tests age-specific occurrence of infection results of past investigations have suggested that age may be a factor in producing differences in sensitivity of the cf and hal tests cf was found to be most sensitive when the population studied was composed of adults 9  and hal was most sensitive when the population was made up exclusively of children 4  the ages of individuals who exhibited the rises in titer were therefore examined showed rises in antibody by cf and hal were tested by neutralization they were selected randomly from within individual respiratory years so that all periods would be represented the respiratory year has been defined as extending from september to the following august and is identified by the date in which most of the year fell results are given in table 2 period of collection was the most important predictor of presence or absence of rise in titer of neutralizing antibody since the 1966 and 1969 periods on the one hand and the 1967 and 1968 periods on the other resembled each other they have been combined in serum pairs in which the second specimen was collected in 1967 and 1968 and in which there was a rise in cf titer alone no rises in titers of neutralizing antibody were found in the pairs from this period with a rise in hal antibody there was an occasional rise in titer of neutralizing antibody and among the few pairs showing an increase in titer by both cf and hal 286 had a rise in titer by neutralization the situation with the 1966 and 1969 specimens was quite different the specimens with rises in cf or hal titer both showed 667 agreement with the neutralization test all specimens with a combined cf and hal increase also had a rise in titer by neutralization thus the 1966 and 1969 period was distinct from the 1967 and 1968 period in having not only more frequent combined cf and hal rises in antibody titer but also because all rises in antibody titer were more likely associated with rises in neutralization titer these findings confirm that the 1966 and 1969 outbreaks were caused by viruses more closely related to oc43 than the viruses involved in infections during the 1967 and 1968 period during 1967 a large-scale outbreak of 229e monto and lim virus was detected in tecumseh 11  it is possible that some of the rises in titer of antibody to oc43 during 1967 might represent cross-reactions from an actual infection with 229e therefore the 21 sera with hal or cf rises in titer of oc43 antibody in 1967 were tested by cf against a 229e antigen of those tested only two 95 showed a rise in titer since this cf test is sensitive when used with sera collected close in time to infection it is probable that the agent involved in producing the rises in oc43 titer during 1967 was other than 229e study of the 1969 outbreak the outbreak detected serologically in late 1968 and the first part of 1969 not only was large scale but was also probably caused by an agent related to oc43 to define better the occurrence of infection during this period serologic data from the 106 families whose second and third specimens of blood were collected during the period from august 1968 to june 1969 were examined separately to complete the study of these families the blood specimens collected on filter paper disks from the younger children were also tested by cf and hal against oc43 antibody persons were identified as infected if they had a significant increase in antibody titer by cf or hal test since during the period both were equally likely to agree with the neutralization test the results shown in table 3 calculated on the basis of person-years of observation indicate the great frequency of infection with the agent those under five years of age showed the highest rates of infection and the rates fell slightly as the age of children increased among adults the 30-39-year age group had the highest rates the very high rate of infection in adults was similar to that observed in the commu- table 3  age-specific occurrence of infection with coronavitus oc43 during 1968-1969 as determined by cf and hal tests  number of persons with rise in antibody titer by cf alone hal alone or both cf and hal nity during the 229e outbreak of 1967 11  howevert the marked involvement of children under age five was not noted at that time nor has it been appreciated in other studies of coronavirus infections relative frequency of cf and hal response among these small children was like that of the rest of the population during this period t with approximately two and a half times as many rises in titer detected by hal compared with those detected by cf familial aggregation of infection was frequent as has been observed with other respiratory viruses 10  as many as four infections were observed in a single family during the 229e outbreak in 1967 in spite of the high rate of infection and the fact that infection was significantly associated with illness no peak in incidence of illness could be identified 11  similarly in the present outbreak no peak of incidence of illness could be identified in february or march 1969 the likely period of peak dissemination of virus investigations on the behavior in populations of respiratory pathogens ideally use as methods both isolation of infecting viruses and testing of sera an isolate can be used as antigen in the serologic procedures and rises in antibody titer related directly to the activity of that virus unfortunately with most of the coronaviruses isolation is difficult 14 15  seroepidemiology is thus the only technique available for study of infections caused by these agents in large numbers of people the relation between the virus chosen for antigen and the virus actually infecting the population can thus be determined only by inference it is known that rises in titer of heterologous antibody do occur 16 17 18  however the exact nature and frequency of these cross-reactions have not been determined only limited numbers of natural infections have been studied by both isolation and serology a situation in which the critical observations on antibody response should be possible thus basic gaps in essential knowledge exist use of parallel cf and hal procedures was based on the possibility that heterologous crossreactions might be encountered it seemed more likely that there would be agreement between the two tests when the infecting organism was closely related to oc43 disagreement could be a result 275 of either lack of close relation between the infecting organism and oc43 or the fact that one of the serologic tests was more sensitive than the other however in terms of differences in agreement from year to year the former factor was operative the viruses in circulation in 1966 and 1969 were clearly more closely related to oc43 than those in circulation in 1968 a difference that would not have been detected had both cf and hal not been used neutralization tests confirmed the difference and indicated that in the individual case during a period of prevalence of agents related to oc43 even if cf and hal do not agree it is likely that an infection with the agent actually did occur it may also be speculated that some minor differences existed between the 1966 and 1969 viruses since cf was more frequently positive in the former period and hal in the latter the annual periodic pattern of coronavirus infections in general is clear from the tecumseh data when the 1967 229e outbreak is included and is in agreement with the findings of others 2 3 8  the outbreaks take place in the period of late winter through early spring with sporadic infections at other times of the year a longer cycle for a specific virus type can also be deduced from the data the period between the oc43-like outbreaks was three years periods of high incidence of 229e infections have also been reported to recur on a two-or three-year cycle 19  the repetitive activity of specific coronaviruses and the fact that they cause large-scale outbreaks of infection is in marked contrast to the situation with the rhinoviruses cycling of these agents occurs but not on any sort of a regular or predictable basis however the number of infections caused at anyone time is low and many agents take part in a single peak of illness 20  the fact that coronaviruses individually seem to cycle more regularly and cause many infections suggests that there are a reasonably small number of these agents in existence this has positive implications in terms of control however reinfection with coronaviruses is a very frequent event in the present study 815 of the infections studied by the neutralization tests occurred despite prior neutralizing antibody others have also noted that antibody is usually present before a rise in titer and have thus called into question the protective value of this circulating neutralizing antibody 9 19  the occurrence of reinfections explains in part the age-specific patterns observed with oc43 infection in tecumseh antibody is acquired early in life as shown by high incidence of infection in children less than five years of age subsequently reinfection is frequent in older children and in adults this frequency of infection in adults may explain the relation of coronaviruses to exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 21  the proportion of the oc43 infections detected serologically that were expressed as clinical illness is difficult to assess kaye et al found that 473 of infections detected in children by hal were accompanied by illness 4  if such a ratio prevailed in tecumseh in the 1969 outbreak it would mean that 121  of all individuals experienced a symptomatic infection during the course of a single season clearly the coronaviruses make a major contribution to the overall burden of respiratory illnesses although illnesses caused appear to be mild their frequency and possible relation to chronic respiratory disease makes further

convalescent porcine canine and feline sera against tgev prcv ccv fipv and pedv were included as controls porcine sera were produced by experimental oronasal inoculation of spf pigs with tgev prcv or

diagnosed fip monolayers for ifat were prepared by infecting secondary porcine kidney cells with tgev and acetone fixation after 24 h sera were examined at a dilution of 12 in pbs using acetone-fixed

peroxidase-conjugated anti-swine igg dako both diluted 1200 in pbst were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 c finally the substrate 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole was added and left for 30 min serum

mixed with 100 tcidso of virus and incubated for 1 h at 37  c following incubation the appropriate cell suspension was added plates were sealed and incubated at 37c in a 7 co2-air mixture neutralizing titres were evaluated after 3-4 days using the method of reed and muench  1938   tgev ccv or pedv culture supernatants were clarified at 3500 g in a ja 14 rotor for 20 min followed by pelleting at 20

substrate o-dianisidine dihydrochloride sigma 03 mgml in pbs initially mink sera were examined in ifat using acetone fixed monolayers of secondary swine kidney cells infected with tgev as substrate and fitcconjugated protein-a to detect specific binding of antibodies to tgev of 71 sera collected during 1990 for routine testing of adv antibodies 68 were found to contain tgev cross-reacting antibodies in ifat at a dilution of 1  2 the pattern of fluorescence was most often diffusely cytoplasmic and very similar to that seen with sera from fipv-infected cats the serological data on mink sera have been summarized in table 1  all of 23 sera from a farm showing high neonatal mortality contained tgev cross-reacting antibodies in ifat at a dilution of 12 these sera represented adult females as well as 6 months old male and female kits also all of 17 sera from experimental animals were positive in ifat for tgev cross-reacting antibodies sera obtained during 1981-1988 were titrated in tgev pla and 31 of 41 samples were positive with titres ranging from 5 to 320 positive samples were evenly distributed over the years with no obvious time-clustering due to cytotoxicity some of the sera included in this study could not be examined in neutralizatioti test all of the 17 sera originating from experimental animals were tested in neutralization tests against tgev and prcv initial dilution 1  10 ccv fipv and fecv initial dilution 15  and none of the sera neutralized any of these viruses furthermore 20 sera  1320 positive by pla tested against tgev and prcv and 16 sera  1616 positive by pla or ifat tested against fipv and fecv were also negative for neutralizing antibodies a high-titered mink antiserum and representative high-titered antisera against tgev prcv ccv fipv and pedv were selected for further studies of the serological relationship of the putative mink coronavirus to other coronaviruses these sera were used to develop western blots of tgev ccv and pedv it should be noted that antisera to ccv and fipv are field sera and not homologous to the strains applied in this study it is apparent that antisera against tgev prcv ccv and mcv all react strongly with all three major structural proteins s 200k m 27k and n 47k of tgev fig 1  a fourth polypeptide 14-15k is revealed by antiserum to tgev only in contrast fipv antiserum reacts primarily with n and m of tgev antiserum against pedv reacts weakly with s and n of tgev a similar pattern was found when using ccv instead of tgev as antigen fig 2 except that staining of the s protein was only evident with ccv antiserum in parallel experiments weak staining of the s protein of ccv has been observed with tgev prcv and mcv antisera not shown antiserum against pedv reacts with s m 28k and n 55k of pedv whereas antisera against tgev prcv ccv and fipv barely reacts with n of pedv fig 3   mink antiserum occupies an intermediate position in that there is a distinct reaction with both m and n of pedv by cross-neutralization tgev prcv ccv fipv and fecv were found to be very similar all being neutralized by antisera to tgev prcv and ccv table 2  on the other hand antisera to fipv pedv and mcv did not neutralize any of the viruses in particular antiserum to fipv did not neutralize the strains of fipv and fecv applied in this study neutralization of pedv was not attempted due to the extreme dependance of replication on trypsin the reactivity of these sera was also tested in pla against tgev fecv fipv and pedv table 3  the titres of antisera against tgev prcv and ccv are higher against tgev and fecvfipv than against pedv antiserum against fipv and mcv are broadly reacting with tgev fecvfipv and pedv whereas antiserum against pedv reacts strongly with the homologous virus and only weakly with fecv examination of mink sera by ifat has shown a high prevalence of antibodies reacting with tgev these results indicate that one or more coronaviruses related to tgev are widespread in the danish mink population and that such viruses have been present at least since 1981 the high prevalence of seropositive animals over several years points towards an enzootic coronavirus infection in balance with its host population at present it is unknown whether this coronavirus infection causes any disease but if so it may be expected that the virus would manifest itself primarily in young animals either as a consequence of waning maternal antibodies or inadequate lactogenic immunity a number of clinical syndromes which might be associated with coronavirus infection have been described in mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis ecg larsen and gorham 1975  occurs primarily in mink four months and older exhibiting a mucoid diarrhea over 2-6 days coronavirus-like particles have recently been identified by negative contrast electron microscopy in feces of animals with ecg gorham et al 1990  a similar observation has been made by one of us bloch unpublished results who found coronavirus-like particles in stool samples from neonatal mink kits these mink kits originated from farms with a high neonatal mortality the mink kits were suffering from diarrhea referred to by farmers as wet mink kits the epizootiology of this syndrom is still unclear henriksen 1989   fip-like symptoms pyogranulomas vasculitis and immune-complex disease  have not been described in mink except for adv-associated immune-complex disease porter et al 1980 but such symptoms should be kept in mind when looking for possible effects of coronavirus infection from the data presented here it is clear that there is a close serological relationship between the putative mcv and both tgev and ccv the results of western blots show that antibodies to mcv react with all three major structural proteins of tgev and ccv however none of the mink sera neutralized any of these viruses indicating that the antigenic domains responsible for neutralization in the spike s protein of tgev and ccv are probably absent from mcv in this respect mcv may resemble field strains of fipv fecv as it has been found that feline field sera having ifat and pla titres of 20 480 or higher against tgev generally do not neutralize tgev or the laboratory strains of fipv and fecv used in this study have unpublished data  it would thus be interesting to have more recent isolates of feline coronavirus and analyze their relationship to mcv no clear relationship has been found between pedv and any other known coronavirus pensaert et al 1981  except for a weak cross-reaction with the n protein of fipv yaling et al 1988   the present results have confirmed this cross-reaction and further shown that it extends to tgev prcv ccv and mcv in addition the m proteins of pedv and mcv are clearly related as seen by the reaction of mink antiserum with the m protein of pedv the present study has shown that infection with a coronavirus serologically related to tgev and pedv is common in the danish mink population at present nothing is known of the pathogenic potential of mink coronavirus if any nor the preferred site of replication in the host studies aimed at answering these questions as well as attempts to isolate the virus have been initiated  evaluation of the serologic cross-reactivity between transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and porcine respiratory coronavirus using commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits ronaldo magtoto korakrit poonsuk david baum jianqiang zhang qi chen ju ji pablo pieyro jeffrey zimmerman luis gimnez-lirola g christopher papasian j   transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the alphacoronavirus 1 species within the genus alphacoronavirus in the family coronaviridae transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a highly contagious virus that causes enteric disease characterized by vomiting severe diarrhea and high mortality in piglets in tgevprcv-naive herds the virus was first described by doyle and hutchings in 1946 in the united states and subsequently reported worldwide 13 porcine respiratory coronavirus is a naturally occurring spike gene deletion 170 to 190 kda mutant of tgev first isolated in belgium in 1984 4 it infects the upper respiratory tract tonsils or lungs with limited intestinal replication 4 5 porcine respiratory coronavirus itself does not appear to be an important primary pathogen with the exception of its contribution to the porcine respiratory disease complex 6 tgev and prcv share biological and molecular features but differ in their epidemiology clinical presentation and pathogenesis real-time reverse transcription-pcr rrt-pcr and multiplex microarray hybridization using primers targeting the 5 region of the s gene spanning the deletion region in pcrv strain are commonly used for the diagnosis of tgev and differentiation of tgev and prcv 710 serum antibodies provide serological evidence of tgev or prcv infection but prcv-infected pigs produce antibodies that cross-react and cross-neutralize tgev ie conventional serological tests cannot differentiate between tgev- and prcv-infected animals this presents a complication for tgev seroprevalence studies and serological surveys of sows or slaughterhouse swine tested for international trade 5 to address the issue of cross-reactivity monoclonal antibodies targeting antigenic regions of tgev that have been deleted from the prcv s protein 1117 have been used to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas for tgevprcv differential serodiagnosis 1720 several commercial tgevprcv blocking elisas are available but comparative test performances have not been reported in recent publications in this study the diagnostic test performances of three commercial tgevprcv blocking elisa kits were evaluated using serum samples of precisely known porcine coronavirus immune status mild watery diarrhea was observed in pigs inoculated with tgev miller strain between 2 to 4 days postinoculation dpi no clinical signs were observed in pigs from the negative-control tgev purdue and prcv-inoculated groups throughout the experiment all animals survived until the end of the study 42 dpi all fecal samples collected from pigs in the tgev strain purdue tgev strain miller prcv-inoculated and negative-control groups were tested by rrt-pcr and found to be tgev and prcv negative prior to the inoculations likewise all oral fluid samples with the exception of one false-positive threshold cycle ct 355 result in the tgev purdue group were negative before inoculation the detection of tgev s and n genes and prcv n gene in pen-based feces and oral fluids by rrt-pcr is shown in fig 1 transmissible gastroenteritis virus was detected in feces between 3 and 28 dpi by rrt-pcr in pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller fig 1a and c no significant fecal shedding was detected in pigs inoculated with tgev strain purdue or prcv throughout the study fig 1a and c viral shedding was specifically detected by rrt-pcr in oral fluid samples collected from pigs inoculated with tgev strain purdue 1 to 21 dpi tgev

epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and porcine delta coronavirus pdcov all pigs in the negative-control group remained tgev and prcv seronegative throughout the monitoring period when tested with any of the three tgevprcv differential blocking elisa kits evaluated in this study swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant biovet ingezim corona diferencial ingenasa and svanovir tgevprcv-ab svanova assays the percentages of tgev antibody-positive serum samples reported by the three commercial elisa kits evaluated over the 50-day study period for pigs inoculated with tgev strains purdue and miller are presented in fig 2a to f respectively suspect results are presented as positives or negatives the first tgev-specific antibody detection was reported between 7 and 10 dpi in both tgev-inoculated groups strains purdue and miller the number of tgev antibody-positive pigs detected increased through the study regardless of the elisa kit used for the tgev purdue inoculation group no significant differences p  005 were found in the percentages of tgev-seropositive pigs reported by the three elisas regardless of the time postinoculation and interpretation of suspect results in contrast for the tgev miller inoculation group we found that a significantly higher p  005 percentage of tgev-seropositive animals was detected by the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa than by both the ingezim corona diferencial elisa dpi 10 and svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa 10 17 and 21 dpi only when suspect results were interpreted as negative a nonspecific tgev antibody response to prcv-inoculated pigs was reported by the three elisa kits between 7 and 42 dpi fig 2g to i no significant differences in the percentages of tgev false positives were found between elisas over the monitoring period when tgev suspect results were interpreted as negative p  005 however the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive regardless of the elisa kit evaluated moreover the percentage of tgev-false-positive results reported by the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa was significantly greater p  005 than those obtained with the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa 14 21 and 35 dpi and ingezim corona diferencial elisa 21 to 35 dpi with the exception of one false-positive result reported 42 dpi by the ingezim corona diferencial elisa kit the negative-control group remained seronegative for prcv by the three commercial elisas throughout the study figure 3 shows the percentage of prcv serum samples detected by the three commercial elisas in prcv-inoculated specific detection fig 3g to i and tgev-inoculated nonspecific detection fig 3a to f animals over the course of the study on prcv-inoculated animals an early prcv-specific antibody response was first detected at 7 to 10 dpi by the three commercial elisas and lasted through 42 dpi fig 3g to i an analysis of the proportion of prcv-seropositive animals showed significant differences between elisa kits over time following prcv inoculation regardless of the interpretation of suspect results p  005 the percentage of prcv-seropositive animals detected by the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa was significantly lower than those with both the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa dpi 14 to 35 and ingezim corona diferencial elisa dpi 17 to 21 and 28 p  005 no differences were found between the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant and ingezim corona diferencial elisas on tgev-inoculated animals a nonspecific prcv serum antibody response was detected by the three commercial elisas this serologic cross-reactivity seemed to be tgev strain dependent with a higher percentage of prcv-false-positive results in the tgev strain purdue-inoculated group fig 3a to c than in the tgev strain miller group fig 3d to f the cross-reactivity appeared more marked at early stages postexposure 7 to 14 dpi no differences were found between elisa kits over the course of the study except at 7 dpi when the proportion of prcv-false-positive animals detected by the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa was significantly greater p  005 than that by the ingezim corona diferencial elisa regardless of the interpretation of suspect results the analytical specificity and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial differential tgevprcv elisa kits evaluated in this study are presented in table 1 diagnostic parameters are presented relative to the interpretation of suspect results as positive or negative overall the diagnostic sensitivity for the tgev miller inoculation group was higher than for the tgev purdue group independent of the commercial elisa kit evaluated the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa kit showed the highest diagnostic sensitivity for antibody detection in pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller 94 regardless of the interpretation of suspect results the diagnostic sensitivity for the tgev strain purdue-inoculated group was higher with the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit 79 when suspect results were considered positive while it was slightly higher with the ingezim corona diferencial elisa kit 54 when suspect results were interpreted as negative the diagnostic sensitivities for prcv antibody detection obtained with both swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa 86 and ingezim corona diferencial elisa 81 to 85 were greater than that of the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit 28 with the exception of the ingezim corona diferencial elisa the diagnostic sensitivity calculated for each elisa kit was not affected by the interpretation of suspect results positive versus negative the three commercial elisas showed 100 diagnostic specificity for both tgev and prcv detection with the exception for one prcv-false-positive result reported by the ingezim corona diferencial elisa which resulted in a diagnostic specificity of 992 for prcv detection the diagnostic specificity of any of the evaluated elisa kits was unaffected by the interpretation of suspect results the ingezim corona diferencial elisa kit showed the highest analytical specificity less cross-reactivity for tgev-specific antibody detection 823 for all three commercial elisas we found higher cross-reactivity to prcv within the tgev purdue inoculation group than in the tgev miller group the highest analytical specificity for prcv was obtained with the ingezim corona diferencial elisa 84 when suspect results were interpreted as positive or with the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit 95 when suspect results were interpreted as negative however the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit showed the lowest analytical specificity 39 of the kits when suspect results were interpreted as positive the greatest risk of introducing tgev is through the importation of pigs from endemically infected countries seronegative pigs of all ages are susceptible to infection with tgev 1 21 22 with the route of infection typically being oral or oral-nasal 23 24 to prevent tgev from entering a naive herd it is important to introduce only animals from tgev-free and serologically negative herds along with disciplined biosecurity therefore quarantine and testing for tgev-seronegative animals are requirements for exportimport into a herd moreover the detection of tgev antibodies particularly in reproductive animals can assist in diagnosis and control of the disease however tgev serology is complicated by cross-reactivity with prcv 5 an s protein deletion mutant of tgev with altered tissue tropism nonenteropathogenic but respiratory that circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide 7 9 25 this cross-reactivity may explain why a region endemic for prcv has less tgev-associated disease 26 porcine respiratory coronavirus does not cause significant losses in swine except for its contribution to the porcine respiratory disease complex historically prcv diagnosis was based on recognition of respiratory disease in growing pigs that have high antibody titers to tgev but have had no clinical enteric disease or lesions of atrophic enteritis conventional serological tests such as virus neutralization indirect fluorescent antibody agar-gel precipitation indirect immunoperoxidase radioimmunoprecipitation and some elisas based on polyclonal tgev antibodies cannot be used for differentiation between tgev and prcv because the two viruses share antigenic determinants located on the spike s membrane m nucleoprotein n and envelope e structural proteins 27 28 the exception is a large deletion 227 amino acids in length in the amino terminus of the prcv s protein that is responsible for the loss of hemagglutination activity 29 this deletion provided the opportunity to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for differentiation of prcv and tgev infections and laid the basis for the commercial tgevprcv differential elisas that are currently available 1720 few field reports have described the use of tgevprcv blocking elisas to differentiate antibodies to tgev and prcv and their utility at the herd level 26 30 31 however no previous reports have compared the diagnostic performances of different commercially available tgevprcv blocking elisas in this study we assessed and compared the diagnostic performances sensitivity specificity and cross-reactivity of three commercial differential tgevprcv blocking elisa kits ie swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa biovet canada ingezim corona diferencial elisa ingenasa spain and svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit svanova sweden at the individual pig level using experimental samples of precisely known porcine coronavirus immune status the use of samples with the same diseaseimmune status allowed for accurate interpretation of test results including those that were discordant or unexpected molecular diagnostic methods eg in situ hybridization and multiplex rrt-pcr targeting both the conserved and prcv deletion regions are utilized to differentiate tgev and prcv in infected pigs 8 32 33 specimens primarily used for tgev virus detection include feces and intestinal contents and those for prcv detection include nasal swabs or lung homogenates in this study the verification and monitoring of the tgev or prcv viral shedding status were performed using rrt-pcr testing of pen-based feces and oral fluids this process provided further information on the dynamics of viral shedding in feces versus oral fluids viral shedding was detected in both feces and oral fluids however for pigs inoculated with prcv and interestingly for tgev purdue virus shedding was only detected in oral fluids this could be related to differences in pathogenicity and tissue tropism which were beyond the scope of this study these results indicated that oral fluids may replace feces as a more suitable specimen for direct detection and surveillance of tgevprcv by rrt-pcr overall we observed differences in the test performances of the three commercial elisa kits evaluated in this study however the differences were more marked for the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa kit compared to either the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa or the ingezim corona diferencial elisa for which test performance was comparable this could be due to differencessimilarities in assay design for instance both the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa and the ingezim corona diferencial elisa use a tgev recombinant s protein antigen on a plate while the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa claims to use noninfectious tgev antigen of an unknown source which could detect antibodies to a variety of viral proteins the way the antigen is presented may also affect assay performance the antigen can either be bound directly to the plate wells as in the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa and svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa or may be captured by antigen-specific antibodies immobilized on the plate as in the ingezim corona diferencial elisa in addition the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa is the only kit using unlabeled tgev and tgevprcv mouse monoclonal antibodies mabs which requires an additional incubation step with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase hrp-conjugated secondary antibody undisclosed differences in buffer composition could also be involved in the differences in assay performance among the kits all three elisa kits showed higher diagnostic sensitivity in the detection of anti-tgev antibodies in pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller 779 to 944 than in pigs inoculated with tgev strain purdue 653 to 789 regardless of the kit used the differences in diagnostic sensitivity among tgev-inoculated groups could be due to strain-related differences in virulence which may have impacted the magnitude of the immune response indeed in this study pigs inoculated with tgev strain miller showed mild watery diarrhea between 2 and 4 dpi while no clinical signs or viral shedding in feces were observed in the pigs inoculated with tgev purdue the diagnostic specificity of the three commercial elisa kits was evaluated on pigs of precisely known negative porcine coronavirus immune status ie the porcine coronavirus negative-control group to rule out potential cross-reactivity with other porcine coronaviruses ie pigs virologically and serologically negative for pedv pdcov porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev tgev and prcv all three kits evaluated in this study showed excellent diagnostic specificity ranging from 99 svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa to 100 swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa and ingezim corona diferencial elisa these results were consistent with previous reports in the field where a tgevprcv blocking elisa ie swinecheck and biovet showed a diagnostic specificity of 100 in wild boar populations historically free from coronavirus disease 34 with the final goal of maximizing both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity but understanding that there is a balance between the two parameters diagnostic specificity is of paramount importance during tgevprcv screening due to the impact of false-positive results on global pig trade operations the false-positive rate of any diagnostic test is a function of the specificity of the test and the prevalence of the disease the assessment of the selectivity of the antigen-antibody response analytical specificity was conducted on each of the three commercial blocking elisas using a panel of heterologous monotypic known-status-positive sera generated under experimental conditions specifically in this study the analysis of the analytical specificity was circumscribed to the cross-reactivity between tgev strains purdue and miller and prcv however the potential cross-reactivity between tgevprcv against other swine coronaviruses has previously been reported 35 a test was considered analytically specific for tgev or prcv when it did not react against heterologous positive sera as with the diagnostic sensitivity the overall analytical specificity varied among and across kits and groups of inoculation even with intrakit variations depending upon the interpretation of suspect results serological cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv was previously reported by use of an immunoblotting assay based on tgevprcv structural proteins s m and n and polyclonal antisera 11 this study further confirms that the serological cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv is significant even when using tgevprcv differential blocking elisas overall in this study we observed a poor analytical specificity ie high cross-reactivity for prcv antibody detection in pigs exposed to tgev strain purdue 63 to 72 with no significant differences among kits however with the exception of the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa 76 to 84 we found an acceptable analytical specificity for prcv antibody detection in pigs exposed to tgev miller using the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa 91 to 92 and the ingezim corona diferencial elisa 95 current tgevprcv differential immunoassays are based on a blocking elisa format which is inherently more specific than indirect elisas in the blocking elisa format the degree to which specific antibodies in the test serum sample prevent binding of an agent-specific mab is measured therefore the higher the levels of specific antibodies are in a serum sample the lower the likelihood for cross-reactivity in fact the overall higher tgev antibody detection rate observed within the group inoculated with tgev strain miller correlates with the lower cross-reactivity against prcv that would also explain the overall higher rate of serologic cross-reactivity regardless of the elisa kit used reported during the first few weeks postinoculation when specific antibody levels are still low previous reports indicated that the accuracy of the commercial tgevprcv blocking elisas for differentiating between us tgev and prcv strains was low 14 15 25 individual test results must be interpreted with caution particularly in the event of suspect results we have demonstrated that interpretation of suspect results can impact significantly the diagnostic performance of any of the commercial kits evaluated in this study with differences in their robustness in response to changes in the interpretation of suspect results while analytical specificity improved overall when suspect results were interpreted as negative this often comes at the cost of diagnostic sensitivity in the event of suspect undetermined or unexpected positive results it is recommended that serology testing on paired serum samples be conducted in which a second sample should be drawn 10 to 14 days after the first sample collection paired serum samples should be tested together to maximize the diagnostic value of test results moreover false-positive results reported at early stages postexposure when animals are actively shedding virus could be confirmed by rrt-pcr on oral fluid specimens as evidenced in this study the presence of tgev remains a barrier to international livestock trade 36 the blocking elisa format alone was determined to be useful in large swine populations for the detection of tgev-infected herds moreover the ability to specifically detect prcv antibodies minimized the probability of false-positive tgev results and subsequent exclusion of those herds for trading however this study demonstrates that the serologic cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv at the individual pig level affects the accuracy of commercial blocking elisas therefore it is important to remember that the tgevprcv blocking elisas should only be applied on a herd basis 14 15 17 19 known-status serum samples n  528 collected from pigs experimentally inoculated with tgev purdue n  12 tgev miller n  12 prcv n  12 or with culture

swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant biovet canada ii ingezim corona diferencial ingenasa spain and iii svanovir tgevprcv-ab svanova sweden all assays were performed according to the manufacturers instructions the pig serum samples and controls were first added to the tgev antigen-coated wells for the first incubation step in the ingezim corona diferencial elisa plate wells are coated with a recombinant tgev s protein which is captured by a specific monoclonal antibody mab the swinecheck tgevprcv recombinant elisa is also based on a recombinant tgev s protein but directly coated on plate wells while the svanovir tgevprcv-ab elisa uses noninfectious tgev antigen source unknown as a coating antigen if anti-tgev or anti-prcv antibodies are present in the test sample they will bind to the viral tgev antigen in the wells and block the antigenic sites in contrast if anti-tgev or anti-prcv antibodies are absent in the test sample these sites will remain free then after a washing step to eliminate unbound antibodies a horseradish peroxidase hrp-conjugated mouse anti-tgev mab targeting the n-terminal region of the s glycoprotein that is deleted in prcv or an anti-tgevprcv mab that binds to conserved regions of both tgev and prcv is added into the first well odd column or second well even column respectively and attaches to specific free sites of the virus thus when antibodies in the test sample occupy the binding sites on the antigen the binding of the conjugated mabs is blocked if anti-tgev or anti-prcv antibodies are absent in the test sample these sites will remain free the amount of antibody in the test sample that is bound to the tgev antigen is inversely proportional to the intensity of the color antibody elisa results were expressed as the percentage of

complicated efforts at understanding the role of these viruses in human respiratory illness therefore much of the information on the epidemiology of the agents has come from serologic studies the first human coronaviruses were isolated by different techniques in the united states and britain at approximately the same time the british medical research councils common cold research unit had been studying fluids collected from persons with natural respiratory infections both by standard cell culture isolation methods and by inoculating them into human volunteers rhinoviruses or other cytopathogenic agents could be recovered from a portion of the flu ds 36  there was an additional substantial portion from which no agents could be isolated but which could still cause colds in the volunteers organ cultures of human embryonic trachea or nasal epithelium were then used in an effort at detecting the recalcitrant viruses present in the fluids a specimen b814 which had been collected in 1960 from a boy with a common cold had not yielded a virus on inoculation into cell culture after the specimen had been passaged serially three times in human tracheal organ culture it could still cause colds on inoculation into volunteers which indicated that replication had taken place when the specimen was passaged similarly in ferret tracheal culture it lost its ability to produce illness additional evidence of viral replication in human organ culture was interference with growth of a second challenge virus and some reduction in ciliary activity 58 in chicago during the winter of 1962 five agents were isolated in primary human kidney cell cultures from specimens collected from medical students with common colds the viruses were ultimately adapted to wi-38 cultures and exhibited a type of cytopathic effect not previously seen a prototype strain 229e was selected for characterization and was found to be rna-containing ether labile and 89 nm in diameter but

these novel viruses werc of more thanl passing significance became clear when organ culture methods were added to standard cell culture techniques in a study of acute respiratory infections of adults conducted at the national institutes of health six viruses were found which grew in organ but not cell culture and were ether labile on electron microscopy the agents were shown to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus in structure 39  the b814 and 229e strains were soon also demonstrated to have a similar structure on electron microscopy and to develop in infected cells by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles 1 2 22  as a result of the similarity of the human agents to infectious bronchitis virus ibv and also to mouse hepatitis virus mhv they were collectively considered to represent a group of vertebrate viruses distinct from the myxoviruses antigenically and structurally 3  the name coronavirus was adopted for the group to describe the fringe of projections seen arounid them on electron microscopy  18  except for 229e none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture mcintosh et al reported successful adaptation of two of the nih isolates oc organ culture 38 and oc43 to the brains of suckling mice these strains were shown to be essentially identical antigenically but quite distinct from mouse hepatitis virus only oc38 and oc43 could be so adapted the other four oc strains resisted such attempts 37  infectious bronchitis virus was known to exhibit hemagglutination under certain conditions but no such phenomenon had been demonstrated for the human strains until oc38 and oc43 had been adapted to mice kaye and dowdle found that the infected brain preparations would directly agglutinate red cells obtained from chickens rats and mice the agglutination was specific and was not inhibited by receptor-destroying enzyme this technique greatly expanded the ability to do epidemiologic studies since it was simple and reproducible 32  other more recent developments have included adaptation of oc38 anid oc43 to growth cell monolayers either mouse brain or organ culture material could be used as source of virus cpe appeared in tube cultures of primary rhesus or vervet monkey kidney cells after two to three passages 11  further adaptation to other cell systems was also possible cytopathic effects developed in bs-c-1 cells by about seven days after inoculation not only was cytopathic effect available for reading of neutralization tests the oc38-43 virus was found to hemadsorb red cells of rats and mice making available a more precise means of evaluating endpoints in tests involving these organ culture derived strains 30  the other oc strains which could not be adapted to mouse brain resisted adaptation to cell culture finally immune electron microscopy has been added to the methods available for identifying the presence of coronaviruses in organ culture harvests this highly sensitive technique should improve the ability to detect virus but is obviously not suitable for use in all but the most specialized studies 31  sources of mortality data coronaviruses that infect domestic and laboratory animals produce illnesses which are sometimes fatal in contrast there is no documented report yet on record of human coronaviruses being involved in a lethal infcction this situation may be a reflection of the limited number of investigations carried out as yet it is known that these agents frequently infect small children and reinfect adults including persons with chronic respiratory disease 53  it would be logical to assume that deaths could occasionally occur in these most susceptible segments of the population but they are probably not very frequent since coronaviruses usually produce respiratory illnesses indistinguishable from those caused by many other types of viruses it is not possible to obtain data on morbidity in the absence of laboratory identification of infection the viruses are difficult to isolate so that most workers have relied on serologic techniques to increase the numbers that can be studied investigations into coronavirus infection have usually formed part of overall evaluations of the role of viruses in general in respiratory illnesses as indicated in the partial listing in table 1  a variety of different open and closed populations have been used for these studies the 229e strain was originally isolated from medical students in chicago as part of a longterm study of respiratory illnesses in young adults 21 23  employee groups have been the source of specimens in the national institutes of health 29 42 and in the studies at charlottesville virginia 26  infection has also been evaluated in childrens homes 34 or boarding schools kendall 36 in the military 60  and among children hospitalized for severe respiratory illnesses in various parts of the world 29  serologic methods have been used to detect occurrence in persons with acute exacerbations of asthma 40 or chronic obstructive respiratory 21 miedical studeilts2 29e washiington dc 29 42 hlospitalized childreni 2291ej 0c43 bethesda aid 29 42 adult emiployees 229e oc viruses atlanta ga 34 disease 53  patterns of coronavirus infection have been identified among the general population residing in the tecumseh community as part of a longitudinal study of respiratory illness 16 49  human volunteers have continued to be employed especially to determine characteristics of illness not yet well defined in natural infection because of problems associated with isolation of the viruses 7 8  serologic surveys although relatively simple serologic techniques are now available for two types of coronaviruses extensive surveys of antibody prevalence have not been carried out when done the surveys have often formed a part of studies mainly directed toward determination of incidence of infection information on prevalence of antibody is available for populations in the united states 16 26 42 britain 8  and brazil 15  a special situation is the presence in man of antibody against two coronaviruses of animals the finding of mouse hepatitis antibodies in military recruits and in children and adults from the general population was surprising when first described in 1964 25  it is now recognized that this does not indicate past experience with mhv but rather with human coronavirus strains which are known to cross react with it in contrast in a survey of antibodies to avian infectious bronchitis virus none could be found in a military population low level antibodies were detected only in a portion of individuals who had close contact with poultry 45  this virus is not known to cross react with the human strains only the 229e strain was originally isolated in cell culture it was eventually adapted to wi-38 cells in which it has been maintained 23  however this cell line is not a reliable system for primary isolation of 229e-like agents to date human embryonic intestine ma177 has proven the most suitable cell system but it is available only in limited quantities 29  all other known human coronaviruses were originally isolated in organ cultures of human trachea or lung 24 39 58 59  the presence of virus was usually detected by electron microscopy or sometimes by fluorescent antibody testing of impression smears 57  two strains which are essentially identical oc 38 and 43 have been adapted to mouse brain and to primary monkey kidney and bs-c-1 cell cultures 11 30 37  another cell system li 32 a heteroploid human lung line has been reported to be suitable for primary isolation of 229e a related virus lp and the first described organ culture agent b814 6 9  this latter finding has not been confirmed by other workers  11 neutralization tests of varying degrees of complexity can be performed for all described coronavirus types the most involved procedure must be used for those viruses which up to now have never been adapted to systems other than organ culture 39  this technique involves incubating serum with known virus and inoculating the mixture into cultures of human trachea reduction in viral yield is determined by electron microscopy for those viruses adapted to cell cultures tube or plaque reduction neutralization tests are available wi-38 or l132 cells may be used for both methods in tests involving 229e virus a number of cell lines including primary monkey kdney and bs-c-1 have been used for neutralization tests involving the oc38-43 virus 5 9 11  hemadsorption rather than cytopathic effect can be used for identification of endpoints with the latter cell line 12 13  most of the seroepidemiologic studies have not used neutralization but rather complement-fixation cf or hemagglutination-inhibition hi tests as sources of their data the method of preparing a cf antigen for 229e directly from cell culture harvests was reported along with the original description of the viruses by hamre and procknow 23  the antibody detected was of low titer and appeared to be present for only a short time after infection this observation was subsequently confirmed in a large scale study and it was suggested that the presence of cf antibody in a population could be interpreted as evidence for recent activity of the virus 15  however if the antigen was highly concentrated antibody could be detected at a higher titer and this antibody persisted in the population so that the method could be employed in surveys of prevalence 5  an indirect hi test has also been described for 229e virus using tanned sheep erythrocytes the procedure appears to be highly sensitive and no cross reactions with oc43 were observed 35  complement-fixation tests can be performed with oc38-43 virus using infected suckling mouse brain as antigen antibody response of individuals infected with this virus appeared to be specific enough to avoid confusion with 229e 42 the same mouse brain material could also be used for the hi test of oc38-43 antibody the hemagglutination titer was higher for rat than chicken erythrocytes but was sufficient with the chicken cells so that they could generally be employed in hi tests this is of particular importance in view of spontaneous agglutination which often complicates working with rat erythrocytes serum to be tested did not require treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme but rather standard heat inactivation at 56c the agglutination took place equally at various temperatures including room temperature 32 other serologic tests have been developed which have been used more in antigenie analyses of the different coronaviruses than in epidemiologic studies with the indirect fluorescent antibody technique characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions were demonstrated with 229e oc43 and even with the other viruses grown in organ culture and prepared for testing by making smears of fragments of the infected trachea 41  it has also been possible to demonstrate precipitin lines on gel diffusion tests with coronavirus antigens concentrated 10to 50-fold two or three precipitin lines were observed by bradburne in tests with hyperimmune animal or human serum 5 but others have identified only one such line 33  the coronaviruses of animals produce serious illnesses in their respective species in addition to hepatitis of mice and infectious bronchitis of chickens these viruses are responsible for transmissible gastroenteritis and encephalomyelitis in pigs and neonatal diarrhea in calves 44 55 56  they are rather species-specific in their int vitro growth characteristics especially on primary isolation but such isolation is easily accomplished 54  in contrast the human coronaviruses produce relatively superficial infections of the respiratory tract species-specificity is observed here too but even in cell systems of human origin isolation of some types has not been possible it is conceivable that special conditions are required for propagation of these agents this would be similar to the situation that obtained with the rhinoviruses another surface pathogen before the availability of wi-38 cells 52 very little information is available in the relationship of coronavirus structure to patterns of infectivity and antigenicity the viruses resemble the myxoviruses in size type of nucleic acid contained and to a certain extent in morphology the spikes of the virus are distinct in appearance from those of the myxoviruses and are reported to contain glycopolypeptides both ha and cf antigens have been associated with the surface of the virion and are presumably located in the projections no neuraminidase has been demonstrated and therefore it has been concluded that the antigens belong to a single species present on the surface by analogy antibodies to these antigens should be associated with protection 28 33  the total number of serologic types infecting man has not been defined the problem here again revolves around the difficulties encounterd in isolating the human coronaviruses there is no way of estimating the proportion of existing types that have already been isolated it is also difficult to determine the separate antigenic identity of types which grow only in organ culture as compared with those which grow in cell culture neutralization cf hi gel diffusion and immunofluorescent techniques have been used in the antigenic analyses by mcintosh et al bradburne and bradburne and somerset 41 5 8  as would be expected results have differed by each of these procedures with neutralization tests the most specific however cross reactions were commonly demonstrable even by this method using animal antiserum or immune ascitic fluid indicating that there must be many shared antigens an attempt at placing the human coronavirus in broad groups is shown in table 2  mouse hepatitis virus mhv is included because of its frequent interrelationships with the human strains and avian infectious bronchitis virus omitted because it is antigenically distinct the unadapted organ culture strains have been listed separately it has not been possible to prepare animal antisera against them and they have been tested only against pairs of serum obtained either from individuals naturally infected or volunteers challenged artificially such sera would be expected to be considerably less specific than animal antisera it has been clearly shown in several laboratories that 229e is quite different from oc38 and oc43 not only in growth characteristics but also antigenically cross reactions can be shown by neutralization tests but these are demonstrable only using very sensitive procedures the lp virus was originally isolated in organ culture and not in cell culture but is closely related antigenically to 229e the oc38-43 virus has a low level cross reaction with mouse hepatitis virus in some reports this has been reciprocal and in some one way although b814 virus is quite different from oc38-43 virus they both share some antigens in common again cross reactions with 229e are rare among the additional viruses oc44 is closely related antigenically to oc38 and oc43 but has never successfully been adapted to mouse brain or cell cultures the four other viruses are listed together by exclusion not because of any demonstrated relationship to one another but rather because they are not closely related to viruses in the first three groups some low level reactions with the agents in these three groups have been shown to be present with oc16 virus being the most distinctly dfferent strain while neutralization methods are of value in grouping virus the cf and hi tests and their specificity are of special importance in planning epidemiologic studies these tests are generally available only for the 229e and oc38-43 viruses cross reactions between these two viruses have only rarely been reported when tested by cf against animal sera with human serum heterologous rises in antibody titer have been observed occasionally but not frequently enough to create problems in studies involving significant numbers of specimens 10  of greater practical concern is the occurrence of cross reactions between oc38-43 and the other organ culture viruses it is possible that rises in titer detected when using oc43 antigeni in a seroepidemiologic study may have been caused either by oc43 infection itself or by infection with one of these other viruses which share antigens with it indirect evidence that the infecting agent may not be oc43 itself is the apparent disseciation between the cf and hi tests for oc43 observed during a particular period of time rises in titer by cf should usually be accompanied by rises in titer by hi in the same serum pairs if this does not ordinarily occur during one time period but does during a second period it indicates that a related virus but not oc43 was circulating during the first time 49  data on the etiologic role of coronaviruses in respiratory infections derive from laboratory and field studies the viruses do interfere with the action of cilia in tracheal organ culture which suggests that they should have the same effect in vivo in addition volunteers have been inoculated with essentially all available strains with production of illness 7 8  it has also been possible with 229e to demonstrate that natural infecton was statistically related to the production of illness during the 1967 outbreak of 229e infection in tecumseh ml illness was significantly more common among those with infection than among matched individuals without infection 16  similarly 229e infection among chicago medical students was statistically associated with illness when those with rises in titer were used as their own controls 21   evidence is steadily mounting that the coronaviruses are of major importance in common respiratory infection of all age groups especially those occurring in midwinter and early spring the total impact of coronavirus infections on the general population cannot be calculated at present because not all viral types have been identified only 229e and oc43 are amenable to large scale serologic studies iniection rates for other distinct types such as oc16 cannot be determined the assumption must be made that the former two types are typical of the other viruses incidence of infection with these agents exhibits a marked cyclic pattern so that it is to be expected that reported rates will vary based on the number of seasons of high viral activity included in a particular study the activity of 229e was found to be of high prevalence in three out of six years of a study among chicago medical students the mean annual incidence of infection during the total period was 15 based on person-years of observation the criterion for identification was a reproducible twofold seroconversion determined by cf there was marked year-to-year variation in infection frequency ranging from a high of 35 of those tested in 1966-1967 to a low of 1 in 1964-1965 however nearly 97 of the infections occurred during the months from january to may often at a time when isolation of rhinoviruses was at a low and seroconversions for 229e were only rarely accompanied by a rise in titer for another respiratory agent 21  the serologic study of 229e activity in the community of tecumseh michigan initially covered two years which included one period of high prevalence like the study in chicago routine blood specimens were collected so infection rates could be determined unlike it the study group was composed of individuals of all ages living in their homes over the two years infections were detected in 77 of individuals tested by cf as shown in the curve in fig 1  however this appeared to be an underestimate of the actual activity of the virus serum specimens had been collected on a regular basis six months apart rises in titer by cf occurred most frequently in those pairs in which the second specimen was collected in april 1967 clearly indicating the peak period of viral dissemination at this time the neutralization test was moderately more sensitive than the cf procedure however because of the brief persistence of elevated cf antibody following infections the cf test became much less sensitive for testing sera that were collected after april here the neutralization test could still be relied upon therefore cf and neutraliza- 16 mi 1966 mi -1967 studied this rate 34 was remarkably similar to the 35 observed in chicago at the same time because of the limited period of viral activity it was possible to compare illness rates of those infected with persons not infected matched by age and sex it was estimated that 45 of the infections had produced clinical disease thus in the population the rate of 229e-associated illnesses during the outbreak was 15 per 100 persons studied clustering of infections in family groupings were apparent as was activity in all age groups including children under five years of age 16  in other investigations of 229e activity attention has been directed mainly toward study of associated illnesses in such studies sera have been collected before and after the illness rather than continually on a routine basis as done to determine infection rates employees at state farm insurance co in charlottesville va were studied during an eight-year period for rises in titer for both 229e for oc43 by cf 229e infection could be related to 3  of the colds that occurred in the winterspring and to 04 of colds that occurred in the summer-fall while there was some year-to-year variation in activity differences in the number of specimens tested from various years did not permit complete identification of cyclic patterns in particular no specimens were available for the 1966-1967 winter-spring season 26  employees of the national institutes of health with respiratory illness were studied by both isolation and serology for 229e infection over a six-year period again attention was specifically directed toward certain segments of the six years and no specimens were tested during other segments of particular interest once more is the segment from december 1966 to april 1967 isolation of rhinoviruses and myxoviruses were uncommon at this time but respiratory illnesses continued to occur during that period 24 of those persons with colds studied had rises in titer for 229e as part of the same investigation paired blood specimens collected from infants and children admitted to hospital with acute lower respiratory disease during the 1967 period of 229e activity were tested for rise in antibody against the virus but none was found 29 42  surveys of prevalence of 229e antibody have also been carried out to document past history of infection often as parts of longitudinal studies a general finding is that antibody is present in a significant portion of adults who in spite of possessing this antibody can go on to have reinfection and illness reports of antibody prevalence in adults in the united states have varied from 19 to 41  depending on the type of test used to determine antibody and time of collection of serum 16 26 42  children under 10 years of age exhibited lower mean antibody titers than older children or adults 16 42  individual sera from normal healthy adults collected serially in britain from 1965 through 1970 were tested by bradburne and somerset 8  it is of interest that there was a buildup in sera positive by cf from approximately 17 in specimens collected in october-december 1966 to 62 in those collected in july-september 1967 this would suggest that the spring 1967 outbreak which occurred in several parts of the united states may have taken place in britain as well populations employed to study infection and illness caused by oc43 virus have generally been the same ones employed to study the occurrence of 229e virus kay et al used an additional group healthy children institutionalized in atlanta ga in which to identify infection by means of their hi test the investigation carried out from 1960-1967 involved collection of serum specimens related to illness and also routine collection of sera from some non-ill individuals infections with the agent were detected in all years of the study but with definite cyclical variation seasons most involved were the winter and spring overall 3 of the illnesses recorded in the seven years could be associated with oc43 infection with a high of 7 in 1960-1961 interestingly testing of the sera collected routinely from non-ill individuals indicated that an additional equal number of oc43 infections were occurring without the production of symptoms 34  the charlottesville study of adult employees studied oc43 infections along with 229e here too the emphasis was on illness and it was found in all years studied that oc43 as associated with 5  of colds in the winter-spring and with no illnesses in the summer-fall again there was cyclical variation from year to year in the number of rises in titer detected 26  the original isolations of oc38 and oc43 were made in december and january 1965-1966 as part of the study carried out among nih employees with colds testing of sera collected from these employees indicated that during this period up to 29 of the colds studied were accompanied by rise in titerfor oc43 in the children hospitalized with lower respiratory disease up to 10 of illnesses during this period were associated with such a titer rise however it was impossible to show that the relationship to disease was truly etiologic this finding was in contrast to that seen with 229e in which no rises in titer were detected in such cases 42 38  another suggestion that oc43 might be involved in lower tract disease came from the study of coronavirus infection in acute respiratory disease ard in the military during a sharp outbreak of ard in the winter of 1970-1971 many of the recruits had infections with other agents besides oc43 however in 297 there was evidence of only oc43 infection 60  in the tecumseh study occurrence of oc43 infection was determined in the community population over a four-year period cf and hi tests were used on all specimens and neutralization tests were used as an aid in evaluating these results in selected specimens during the total period oc43-related infection was detected in 171 of the 910 persons studied for one year most of the infections took place in the winter-spring months of 1965-1966 1967-1968 and 1968-1969  the only winter-spring period without such activity was in 1966-1967 when the 229e outbreak had taken place there was good agreement between the cf and hi tests for the 1965-1966 and the 1968-1969 periods but not for 1967-1968 the neutralization test was used to clarify the situation it was found that most rises in titer for the periods in 1965-1966 or 1968-1969 whether they had occurred by cf or hi or both were also accompanied by rises in neutralizing antibody in -1968 cf rises in titer were not accompanied by rises in titer in the other test nor was the reverse true significant change in neutralizing antibody in this period was exceedingly rare it was concluded that the outbreaks of infection in 1965-1966 and 1968-1969 probably were caused by agents closely related to oc43 while the 1967-1968 activity was due to one of the other oc viruses which shares some antigens with oc43 but is more distantly related to it the 1968-1969 outbreak of oc43 infection was nearly as widespread as the prior 229e outbreak with 256 of the population studied showing evidence of infection of special interest was the fact that children under five years of age had the highest infection rates 49  surveys of antibody prevalence have been conducted in several settings using oc43 antigens mcintosh el al found that children began to acquire antibody to this virus in the first year of life by the third year of life more than 50 had antibody present among adults 69 of individuals could be demonstrated to have antibody this indicates in view of the high incidence of infection with the agents in all age groups the frequency with which such infections must represent reinfection 42  the high prevalence of antibody has been confirmed in other studies 26 34  bradburne and somerset followed prevalence of antibody for oc43 over time as they also had done with 229e each year the greatest prevalence of antibody was found in the winter-spring period the single highest point in antibody prevalence was in january-march 1969 at the same time the oc43 outbreak was occurring in some parts of the united states 8 occurrence of coronaviruses infection has been documented either by isolation or serology from coast to coast in the united states in addition to the studies listed in table i a 229e-like virus has been isolated in california and oc43 and 229e have been demonstrated to be present in vermont by serologic methods 51 53  extensive studies have of course been carried out by the common cold research unit which has demonstrated the presence of the agents in britain the activity of 229e virus has been documented in brazil in a study of children and adults with and without respiratory illness significant rises in antibody titer accompanied non-hospitalized respiratory infection in the children prevalence of antibody was determined by cf and like the situation in some studies in the north temperate zone children had little antibody while 26 of adults were antibody positive 15  these findings suggest that coronaviruses will be found to be worldwide in distribution and to cause similar types of illness in different localities such a situation has been noted with many other respiratory viruses 47  an attempt was actually made to detect rises in antibody titer for 229e in paired sera collected from small children with lower respiratory infection in many tropical parts of the world no evidence of infection was found which is hardly surprising since no rises in titer were found in similar sera collected as part of the same study in washington dc 17 29  epidemiic behavior and temporal distribution because most illnesses caused by coronaviruses are similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses it is impossible to identify epidemic behavior of the viruses there is however great variation in the frequency of infection both on a seasonal and on a cyclical basis isolation and rises in antibody titer for all types of coronaviruses have been rare events outside of the period from december through may this is the portion of the year in which isolation rates for rhinoand other respiratory viruses often reach their low in addition a cyclic pattern can be discerned when individual virus types are considered in fig 2 are summarized data from five longitudinal studies of coronavirus activity carried out in different parts of the united states in all studies some sporadic activity did occur in nearly all years studied but rises in antibody titer were concentrated in certain years which far exceeded the means for the entire studies those periods are indicated as darker areas in the figure the times during which specimens were collected in each investigation are indicated in the figure by the large rectangle for 229e activity was detected in all four studies at the same times even though two were in the midwest and two in the eastern united states it seems possible on the basis of these data to postulate a two to three year cycle for this agent the greatest number of infections in chicago was seen in 1967 after absence of the agent for three years which would suggest a role of herd immunity in determining the time of reappearance of the agent with oc43 the situation is quite different as with 229e in no investigation did two years with high rates of infection or illness follow one another a possible exception was in the tecumseh study however the agent which caused the rises in titer in 1967-68 did not appear as closely related serologically to oc43 as the agent involved in the other two outbreaks this observation indicates a problem in identifying cycling of oc43 the virus undoubtedly shares more antigens with other identified or perhaps unidentified coronaviruses than does 229e see table  2  and these other viruses may well have cycles of their own which may confuse the situation in 1964-65 high activity occurred in atlanta and charlottesville however in bethesda just a short distance away high activity was not seen in that year but in 1965-66 the same time as high activity occurred in michigan many miles away in 1968-69 charlottesville and tecumseh data did agree with very high activity in both areas thus cycling of the agents was found in all studies but they did not agree on specific years this may be a result of actually different patterns of occurrence or because of differences in the serologic techniques used to identify infection which are of greater importance with oc43 because of the problem of cross reactions the fact that cycling of coronaviruses does exist and occurs every two to four years with production of many infections suggests that the number of truly different coronaviruses must be relatively small unlike the situation with the rhinoviruses in which cycling has been more difficult to demonstrate in part because of the large number of serotypes 14  all age groups are involved in infection with oc43 virus high rates have been noted in children or adults during studies separately examining both groups in the tecumseh study a total population group was followed during the 1968-1969 outbreak infection rates were relatively uniform for all age groups varying from a high of 292 per hundred person-years in the 0-4 age group to 222 in those over 40 years of age 49  this finding is quite different from the situation that exists with other respiratory agents such as respiratory syncytial virus where a more distinct decrease in infection rates can be observed with increase in age 48  the reversal of the pattern of age-specific infection rates customarily associated with the respiratory viruses becomes complete with 229e infection has been more difficult to demonstrate in small children with this agent than in adults in tecumseh during the 1966-1967 outbreak highest age-specific infection rates by cf were found among those 15-29 years of agc following a steady increase in infection frequency from the 0-4 year olds however when neutralization tests were used to detect rise in antibody titer the 15-19 year olds still had high infection rates but the serial increase to that point among younger age groups was much less steep 16  this would suggest that the appprent sparing of small children with 229e may be a result of the relative insensitivity in the young of the serologic procedures commonly employed it would be surprising if two different coronavirus serotypes behaved so differently other factors there is little evidence of a sex differential in infections with the coronaviruses simply because the data have rarely been examined in such a manner in tecumseh adult females experienced higher infection rates with oc43 than adult males which is in conformity with the usual patterns of all respiratory illnesses 46  in the study of antibody prevalence of cardeias the results were examined by sex but no significant differences could be observed 15  there are no available data on occupation or racial susceptibility to infection nor on the role of socioeconomic status in influencing rates occurrence of infection in closed or special populations such as the military or childrens institutions has been reported 34 36 60  however it is at present difficult to determine based on the relative paucity of information on the behavior of the virus in open populations whether they exhibit any unique features in other settings the suggestion that oc43 virus might cause ard in recruits if confirmed will be a distinct departure from the types of illness customarily associated with that virus in young civilian adults the role of the school age child in dissemination of coronavirus has not yet been clearly defined but it would be surprising if these infections differed in their transmission patterns so markedly from that documented with the other agents because of the high frequency of infection in older children and adults other sites of dissemination may also be of significance it has actually been possible to show that the family unit is of importance in transmission since clustering of 229e and oc43 infections in families was observed in the tecumseh study while nutritional and genetic factors have not been associated with susceptibility to coronavirus infections there are clear indications that the viruses are associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive respiratory disease such a finding is hardly surprising in view of the high infection rates which have been observed in unselected older adults it has not as yet been demonstrated that this represents a true increased susceptibility to infection or simply a more severe form of expression of the infection when it occurs in an already compromised host in addition to the situation in older individuals there is evidence that both oc43 and 229e may trigger acute attacks of wheezing in young asthmatics 40 53  the coronaviruses are transmitted by the respiratory route it has been possible artificially to induce infection in human volunteers by inoculating virus into the nose 7 59  no other route of transmission for coronaviruses seems involved in man although animal coronaviruses are infectious by the fecal-oral route 56  there is no direct evidence to aid in identifying the main mechanisms of transmission however it is possible to compare the epidemiologic behavior of the coronaviruses with other respiratory agents whose transmission mechanisms have been more directly studied large scale outbreaks of coronavirus infections have taken place as in tecumseh in 1967 16  this is much more analogous to the situation seen with influenza than it is with the rhinoviruses it is likely that the former agent can be transmitted by aerosol in addition to large droplet which would explain its ability to spread quickly 19  rhinoviruses on the other hand are transmitted by large droplet and at times may spread via fomites 27 but not by aerosol it is therefore probable that human coronaviruses can be spread by aerosol as well as by large droplet aerosol transmission has actually been documented in poultry by the agent of avian infectious bronchitis 20  there is no evidence that any animal reservoir or vectors are involved in the maintenance of infection or transmission of the human coronaviruses each animal coronavirus appears to be restricted to its own species the only known exception is the finding of antibody of avian infectious bronchitis virus in sera of poultry workers but not of controls 45  the incubation period of coronavirus colds is relatively short in studies involving human volunteers the mean period from inoculation of virus to development of symptoms was from 32-35 days depending on the strain with a range of from 2 to 4 days 7 59  following exposure the virus apparently multiplies superficially in the respiratory tract in a manner similar to that in which multiplication occurs in vitro virus excretion usually reaches a detectable level at the time symptoms begin and lasts for 1 to 4 days the duration of the illness is from 6 to 7 days on the average but with some lasting up to 18 days serologic response to either induced or to naturally acquired infection has been quite variable depending on the infecting strain and the serologic test employed for example among those experimentally infected with oc38-43 virus who had a cold produced only 46 had rises in titer by hi and 23 by cf less than half of those infected with 229e showed a cf rise it is not clear how the existence or titer of preinfection antibody affects the magnitude of the response detected by these tests rises in neutralizing antibody titer are much easier to detect and have been found with sensitive techniques to be demonstrable in all experimentally infected 5 8  many of the infections observed with the coronaviruses are in fact reinfections in the tecumseh study 815 of those infected with oc43 actually possessed prior neutralizing antibody 49  possession of circulating oc43 hi antibody among the atlanta children did not appear to play a role in modifying expression of the subsequent infection 34  with 229e virus hamre and beam demonstrated that frequency of rises in titers detected by neutralization was inversely proportional to prior neutralizing antibody which would indicate that this antibody exerted some protective effect however the importance of this neutralizing antibody could not be confirmed when infection was detected by cf 21  thus circulating neutralizing antibody as presently measured may bear a relationship to modification of infection but this association is not a very strong one since coronavirus infections mainly involve the surface of the respiratory tract it is likely that secretory iga antibody plays a more direct role in protection this has in fact been demonstrated with a swine coronavirus 4 the coronaviruses generally produce a cold-like illness which on an individual basis would be difficult to distinguish from those caused by other respiratory viruses in both induced and natural infections the most prominent findings have been coryza and nasal discharge with the discharge being rmlore profuse than that customarily seen with rhinovirus colds sore throat has been somewhat less common and in children has been associated with pharyngeal injection 34  experimental colds caused by b814 virus were about as severe as those caused by 229e however natural oc43 infections caused illnesses with considerably more cough and sore throat than did 229e infections 26  the mean duration of coronavirus colds at 65 days is shorter than that seen in rhinovirus colds at 95 days 7 there is no clear evidence that these viruses cause severe lower respiratory illness in infants and young children in fact such infections were more common in one study among the control group than among the diseased 42 mufson et al have associated coronavirus 229e and oc43 infection with acute lower respiratory infections in children at cook county hospital 50  the lack of a comparable control group makes assignment of an etiologic role to the viruses hazardous at present but the relationship should be sought in the future when it is known that outbreaks are taking place in the community the association of oc43 with the acute respiratory disease ard syndrome in military recruits should also be viewed as tentative clinical disease occurred in no more than 45 of those infected with 229e in tecumseh during the 1967 outbreak 16  in atlanta children oc43 virus produced illness in about 50 of those infected 34  it is likely that with increase in age and concomitant experience with these agents the ratio of clinically apparent to inapparent infection will decrease as with other respiratory agents a continuum of severity of symptoms exists among those in which infection results in disease and this may also be related to past experience with the viruses it is premature at present to think in terms of control of coronavirus infection not all viral types have been identified and some known agents cannot be easily propagated in the laboratory thus preparation of vaccines of the conventional types is impossible the frequency of reinfection observed with these agents is so high that control by vaccination may not be practical but it is possible that further studies may allow identification of truly protective antibodies there remains environmental control of infection such efforts have only rarely been useful for other respiratory agents and they are likely not to be more efficacious for the coronaviruses 43 the major immediate need in coronavirus research lies in the laboratory if a practical system can be found for isolation and propagation of the viruses the gaps in understanding the behavior of these agents would quickly be filled only serologic tools are available now for most epidemiologic studies and even these can only be applied to two different coronavirus types therefore much of the data which have been so laboriously gained gives only partial evidence on the total dimensions of the problem and the problem is almost certainly a very large one coronaviruses have been isolated and outbreaks identified in periods of the winter and spring when rhinoviruses and myxoviruses are uncommon it appears that during these times the coronaviruses cause a significant portion of respiratory illnlesses even discounting suggestions of production of severe disease in young children and those with chronic respiratory disease the viruses are important pathogens simply in terms of numbers of illnesses produced only through further understanding of the behavior of these agents will it be possible to determine by what means control can be attempted  prevalence of viral bacterial

a morgan quinn e tammy utteridge d gloria del fierro m bianca vassallo a robert stevenson   use of improved methods for health monitoring and housing protects the health of rats and mice in research establishments and improves the quality of research in the laboratories that depend on these animal facilities1 there are numerous examples of disease in research animal populations compromising the research results derived from the projects2 the presence of mouse hepatitis virus3 mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice4 helicobacter spp5 mycoplasma pulmonis and sendai virus6 and mousepox7 have all confused research results routine monitoring of the prevalence of the various rat and mouse pathogens is useful to the research and laboratory animal community because it allows researchers to assess whether various diseases are increasing or decreasing in importance in a particular animal population in a particular country mice and rats are susceptible to approximately 40 different viral bacterial and parasitic diseases2 many agents cause severe disease often resulting in death but other diseases may be subclinical maintained in an animal colony for a long period of time or clinically silent yet affect research results in subtle ways2 there is also a risk that infectious agents may contaminate animal products such as cell lines and antibodies health monitoring may be expensive and the knowledge of which diseases are common or rare in a local setting is very useful so that frequency of testing and sample size can be adjusted accordingly the increase in number and availability of genetically modified rodent models has expanded the use and number of animals in research facilities all over the world2 in addition the rapid rise in the use of transgenic and knockout mice has resulted in greater numbers of immunocompromised animals in research facilities transgenic animals are often more susceptible to a greater number of infectious agents than are non-transgenic rodents and are also prone to certain rare diseases8 as populations of transgenic rodents grow it becomes more difficult to eliminate many of these diseases9 for these reasons it is important to monitor immunocompromised populations more frequently using different disease panels than those used for healthy rats and mice we carried out a retrospective analysis that presents an accurate assessment of the common and rare diseases in rat and mice colonies in research establishments in australasia a previous report identified mouse norovirus mouse parvovirus mouse hepatitis virus rotavirus theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev helicobacter spp pasteurella pneumotropica and pinworms as common pathogens in mice from animal facilities in north america and europe10 the same report identified rat respiratory virus rat parvoviruses rat theilovirus also known as tmev helicobacter spp p pneumotropica and pinworms as common pathogens in rats from animal facilities in north america and europe10 we wished to establish whether similar diseases exist in laboratory rats and mice in australasia knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used as well as the predictive value of positive and negative test results is useful to allow laboratory animal workers to assess the seriousness of the consequences of a positive result10 we retrospectively analyzed the serological

isolation was carried out by culture and definitive identification was confirmed by pcr for helicobacter spp only the pcr methodology was used for pasteurella spp there was a high correlation between microbiological culture and pcr non-pathogenic or commensal organisms isolated from mice and rats included entamoeba spp chilomastix spp hexamastix spp monocercomonoides spp and retortamonas spp spironucleus spp and trichomonads tables 5 and 6 the most common positive helminthological finding in mice and rats was the presence of pinworms including aspicularis spp and syphacia spp the most common protozoan finding in mice was chilomastix spp and trichomonads this study is not comprehensive but is the first report to our knowledge on the microbiological status of laboratory mice and rats in australasia the most commonly requested viral serological test in mice was that for mouse hepatitis virus in rats the most commonly requested serological test was that for parvovirus testing requests probably reflect current knowledge of outbreaks and therefore skew results the popularity of test requests was not reflected in the prevalence of various diseases however norovirus was the most prevalent virus in laboratory mice in this study these data may include false positive and false negative results although every effort was made to use secondary tests to confirm positive results furthermore the animals submitted to cerberus sciences may not be a representative sample of the research rodent population because institutes are more likely to submit animal during or after a disease outbreak and because not all research institutes in the region submit their routine health monitoring samples to cerberus sciences other health monitoring companies may also be involved in addition some laboratory animal colonies are tested more frequently than others9 although cerberus sciences encourages research institutes to submit animals for routine monitoring throughout the year we also note that these data cannot be compared directly with prevalence rates reported in other publications as each report presents data in different ways our results indicate that in mice submitted between 2004 and 2009 in australasia norovirus was the most prevalent virus 2592 currently mouse norovirus is the most prevalent viral pathogen identified in mice in laboratory animal facilities in the us and canada17 in 2005 the seroprevalence of norovirus in a large number of murine research colonies in the us and canada was reported to be 221 ref 17 and in 2009 the prevalence of norovirus in mice in north america was reported to be 32 the most prevalent virus in the survey10 norovirus can be fatal in immunodeficient mice but does not cause clinical signs or death in immunocompetent mice17 mouse hepatitis virus was the second most prevalent virus in mice in our study 386 it is an important virus in non-spf-housed mice in the us2 in taiwan in 2007 more than 20 of mouse colonies tested were positive for mouse parvovirus mouse hepatitis virus tmev and m pulmonis18 this is similar to prevalence reported in the us19 europe10 korea20 france21 and taiwan18 in 2006 parvoviruses kilham rat virus toolans h-1 virus and rat parvovirus were reported to be the most prevalent viruses in rats in europe9 non-spf-housed rats are reported to be at risk for sialodacryoadenitis and coronavirus which includes sialodacryoadenitis virus and rat coronavirus parvovirus and m pulmonis2 almost 40 of tested rat colonies in taiwan were positive for m pulmonis and rat parvovirus with fewer colonies positive for kilham rat virus sialodacryoadenitis virus pneumonia virus of mice sendai virus and syphacia spp18 in 1978 rat sialodacryoadenitis virus was the most prevalent pathogen in rats in the uk22 but in our study the most prevalent virus in rats was pneumonia virus of mice followed by parvovirus rat coronavirus tmev and mouse adenoviruses 1 and 2 in contrast to results from taiwan18 we did not find any positive serological tests for hantavirus in rats or mice we did find a low prevalence of tmev in both mice and rats although only mice are thought to be involved in endemic infections serological evidence of ectromelia virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in non-spf-housed mice has been reported1 and we found serological evidence of ectromelia virus in mice in our study an absence of serological evidence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and ectromelia virus was noted in 1978 in the uk23 indicating that the prevalence of these pathogens was already declining in that region at that time in 1980 mouse hepatitis virus was prevalent in mouse colonies and the prevalence of sendai virus was increasing2224 mouse hepatitis virus is highly contagious which likely accounts for its continued prevalence10 in contrast the prevalence of sendai virus in rats and mice has recently declined in france21 the incidence and prevalence of sendai virus has also declined in the us and europe10 and our data indicate that its prevalence is declining in australasia as well in 2005 decreases in the prevalence of pneumonia virus of mice reovirus type 3 sendai virus sialodacryoadenitis and m pulmonis in europe were reported9 additionally k virus and polyoma virus were reported to have been eliminated from laboratory animal colonies9 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus k virus ectromelia virus mouse adenovirus and mouse thymic virus had not been detected for over 10 years our results indicate that helicobacter spp were the most prevalent bacteria in mice and that proteus spp were the most prevalent bacteria in rats this is in contrast with recent reports that most prevalent bacteria in rats and mice are helicobacter spp particularly h hepaticus25 m pulmonis is still prevalent in rats and mice in australasia but is of declining importance in the us and europe10 we found no positive tests for streptobacillus moniliformis in either rats or mice although an outbreak of this disease was reported in australia in swiss white mice in 1996 ref 26 the most common positive helminthological finding in mice and rats was the presence of all pinworms including aspicularis spp and syphacia spp the most common positive protozoan finding in mice and rats was the presence of chilomastix spp and trichomonads we used three different tests for the detection of helminths and protozoa external anal tape tests iodine wet preparations of cecal and duodenal mucosa and fecal contents and fecal flotation tests in addition the veterinary pathologist often made mention of the presence of helminths and protozoa in the gastrointestinal system upon histopathological examination using multiple detection methods helps to minimize false-negative results a previous report cautioned against the use of perianal tape impressions alone to screen for syphacia spp in sentinel rats and mice27 syphacia spp infestations in rats and mice have occurred in laboratory animal colonies for many years28 and remain a problem1 our results could potentially be influenced by the fact that most institutes use a soiled-bedding sentinel system which tends to favor the detection of agents transmitted primarily by the oro-fecal route the prevalence of agents transmitted primarily by aerosol or contact could be underestimated in this system using a combination of direct-contact and soiled-bedding sentinels and testing exhaled air is the best strategy for detecting infection18 the barrier-housing status of animals submitted to cerberus sciences was not always stated and therefore was not analyzed in this study in spf-housed rats parvovirus coronavirus pneumonia virus of mice tmev and pinworms are reportedly very common1 in spf-housed mice mouse hepatitis virus parvovirus ectoparasites endoparasites and pathogenic helicobacter spp have been reported12 these reports are similar to our findings which suggests that these agents are problematic in both spf-housed and non-spf-housed animals there is a risk of cross-infection between spf and non-spf housing units1 the definition of spf should be refined and standardized throughout the community1 establishing a judicious testing strategy diagnosing pathogens rapidly controlling identified outbreaks and using animals with known microbiological profiles can help to prevent disease outbreaks in animal facilities in research institutes1 the introduction of serological screening programs and advances in laboratory animal husbandry and disease knowledge have resulted in a decrease in the number of infected laboratory animal colonies9 despite improvements in husbandry and surveillance however much more can be done to safeguard the health of rodents used in biomedical facilities29 inadequate finances facilities and staffing a lack of compliance with recommended or required practices and regulatory constraints all contribute to inadequate health monitoring in animal facilities1 the prevalence of various diseases may have increased recently as institutes house large numbers of transgenic mice and rats that are often immunocompromised10 in japan genetically modified mice had positive serological tests for m pulmonis mouse parvovirus and tmev30 indicating that genetically modified mice are highly susceptible to common laboratory animal pathogens8 although live animals are tested regularly few institutions test external animal products such as cell lines serum and transplantable tumors1 the exchange of animals and biological products between animal institutes has been responsible for some disease outbreaks9 little information is available on the prevalence of disease in laboratory rats and mice in australia but the prevalence of viral antibodies and helminths in field populations of wild mice in southeastern australia has been examined31 mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus rotavirus minute virus of mice mouse adenovirus reovirus and mouse cytomegalovirus and the presence of taenia taeniaformis syphacia oblevata and vampirolepsis spp was detected these results were similar to those in another report which additionally detected m pulmonis sendai virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and parvovirus in wild mice32 the seroprevalence of mouse cytomegalovirus is far greater in wild populations 61733 than in our study 002 in a serological survey of virus infection among wild house mice mus domesticus in the uk mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus mouse cytomegalovirus mouse thymic virus mouse adenovirus mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice34 testing of rodent-borne pathogens carried by wild-caught norway rats in the us detected antibodies against rat coronavirus m pulmonis cilia-associated respiratory bacillus rat parvovirus kilham rat virus toolans h-1 virus sendai virus and tmev35 these reports suggest that many of the pathogens that remain problematic for laboratory rodents are also encountered in wild mice and rats although our panel includes tests for relatively new agents such as mouse norovirus and helicobacter spp future panels may need to include rat respiratory virus36 and rat minute virus rat respiratory virus is the working name for a new respiratory pathogen of laboratory rats in north america europe and asia causing pneumonitis and alveolar hyperplasia in the lungs36 the agent is now thought to be pneumocystis carinii37 in future lung samples from rats will need to be tested by histopathology and the pcr to assess the prevalence of p carinii regular reporting of prevalence of laboratory rodent pathogens is important so that health-monitoring programs can be updated938 although our study is not a comprehensive study of laboratory animals in australasia this 5-y retrospective analysis gives an overview of the prevalence of common viral bacterial and parasitological diseases in laboratory rats and mice these data help to identify which agents are common or rare in laboratory rats and mice in australasia we agree with others who have recommended that research institutes obtain animals from reputable vendors quarantine newly arrived animals maintain animals in adequate housing with trained personnel and test regularly to determine the disease status of research animals  title immunological assays for sars-cov-2 an

which produces covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 which began in the wuhan province in china but has now turned into a pandemic the sequence of the virus genome isolated from patients is similar to a bat virus 4  in china the infection produced mild respiratory symptoms in about 80 of those infected however 5 were admitted to the intensive care unit icu of which 23 received mechanical ventilation and a mortality of 13 5  the rapid case growth around the world means that in a short time the health systems with scarce resources such as icu teams could saturate rapidly 6 the current standard assay for covid-19 diagnosis is the detection of viral rna using rt-pcr in nasopharyngeal swabs 7  rapid and simple immunoassay tests have been developed to detect antigen or igm and igg antibodies separately or simultaneously against the sars-cov-2 virus in human blood even within 15 minutes antibody response can be detected as early as 5 days post-infection 8 and the antibody-secreting cells peak around day 7-8 post-infection 9 10  one of the first peer reviewed studies of this kind of assays showed a test with a sensitivity of 8866 and a specificity of 9063 in 397 patients with sars-cov-2 confirmed by pcr 11 there are currently more than 200 immunoassays for sars-cov-2 to detect antigens or specific antibodies 12  the goal of this study is to carry out a comprehensive review of the wide offer of serological kits to detect sars-cov-2 antigen or antibodies in order to help institutions and policymakers define the best option for a possible massive testing there is an urgent need for rapid serological tests for sars-cov-2 that will be a useful tool for public health in the upcoming days 3  two approaches were used for the literature search web searches for pages listing serology tests for sars-cov-2 and pubmed  httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed  for peer reviewed literature descriptive information from each test was obtained from technical data sheets tds or in their respective company web page variables obtained were country of origin type of immuno-assay procedure time sample type fixed antigen and antibodies isotype for indirect assays sensibility specificity current regulatory status and published studies we used not reported nr to specify when information about a variable was not found and na when a variable does not apply a pubmed search was conducted

individuals 7  also detection of the virus is dependent on the sample origin and time of sampling 15 16  detection of anti-virus specific sars-cov 2 antibodies could help to determine the exposure of a large population to the virus 5 8 9 10  in infected individuals antibody detection by elisa using nucleocapsid protein as antigen was identified at initial reports of the new cov causing acute respiratory distress syndrome came up in wuhan china since then several assays have been developed in order to improve the diagnosis most of them from china 4 19  as expected most of the available tests detect antibodies using blood-derived samples although rt-pcr is considered the most sensitive detection method in respiratory fluid samples it increases the risk of contamination of healthcare workers 20  blood-derived samples are easier to obtain and compared to rt-pcr serological tests are faster require less training and no equipment so they can be used in almost any setting 8 all rights

refrigeration and easily distinguishable visual results exclude the need for additional equipment compared with other methods like elisa 22  antigens used for detection are very important the genome of sars-cov-2 codifies for several structural proteins including the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins 23  the most common antigens used for indirect assays are the recombinant spike and nucleocapsid proteins 16 17  the s protein contains the domain for attachment to the human host cells 24 and the nucleocapsid protein is one of the major structural components involved in many processes of the virus including viral replication transcription and assembly 18  interestingly there is a 905 homology among nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-1 y sars-cov-2 17 and sars-cov-2 showed an homology of about 85 with a coronavirus isolated from bats 4 16  most tests assessed levels of igg and igm simultaneously the humoral response to some sars-associated coronavirus shows a simultaneous increase in the level of all antibodies 25  also the dual detection of igg-igm improves the sensibility in comparison with individual igg or igm antibody assay 11 suggesting a possible improvement in the infection detection in terms of efficiency a shorter procedure time means a greater evaluation capacity of a population test specificity and sensitivity are key for determining the role of these assays in diagnosis and public health programs 26  unfortunately only a minority of the tests present this information maybe due to short time for development however most of them present a sensitivity and specificity well over 90 but with a low number of 9 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

confirmed virus have a median seroconversion rate of 931 for igg and igm 9 in a time dependent manner 9 11  and 15 days after disease onset seroconversion was 100 for both antibody isotypes 9  meanwhile the detection rate of molecular based methods decreased to as low as 45 in that same time 9 15 27  the latter shows that the specificity and sensitivity of each immunoassay are variable depending on the time of onset with more positive results given in a later time of disease onset 17 additionally the different samples that can be used for serological diagnosis offer more consistent results no significant differences were found in blood serum or plasma samples 11 this is opposed to the great variability from samples used in viral rna detection sputum nasooropharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage 15 27 28  both rt-pcr with antibody assays have advantages however the combination of both can provide more accuracy to the initial diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection 11 20  moreover current label requirements showed that most of the offered assays 50 are intended for in-vitro diagnosis and this application represents the usefulness in a clinical environment at this point of the pandemic it would be difficult to suggest which tests are the best for clinical application however the information here presented sheds light into the large number of assays available and the number increases day by day this has to be used carefully we suggest that researchers and policymakers focus on the ones with the most information available such as a rigorous internal validation data a well defined tds and are intended to be used for in-vitro diagnosis more research is needed especially studies that compare between different tests which provide more accurate information than

populations in less time increasing the detection rate and increasing the testing capacity one of the cornerstones needed to decrease the sars-cov2 spread  recent studies show that convalescent patients have high levels of sars-cov2 neutralizing antibodies nabs which increased with patient age 30  interestingly transfusion of convalescent plasma obtained from covid-19 cases improved clinical outcomes of patients with severe disease 31 thus suggesting that the antibodies produced by covid-19 patients during the infection have a posterior protective effect large serological studies to detect virus-specific antibodies will be needed to determine the infected asymptomatic population and also could help to suspend social isolation in seropositive individuals 11 all rights reserved no

10   infection and blood transfusion a guide to donor screening nyssa reine j   it can be difficult to decide what infectious agents to screen for in canine and feline transfusion medicine factors to consider are the transmissibility of the particular agent via transfusion the consequence of acquiring the agent to the recipient and the prevalence of the agent in the region where the donor lives or travels once infectious agents for screening are selected the appropriate test must be selected typically screening tests are tests with high sensitivity and are used because the incidence of false negativity is low confirmatory tests have high specificity and a low incidence of false positivity cost is another factor to be considered because screening for an exorbitant number of diseases may make blood-component therapy cost prohibitive efforts to minimize potential exposure to infectious diseases by controlling the environments of donors ie minimize travel and exposure to new animals and initiating ectoparasite prevention programs are necessary in human transfusion medicine decisions concerning the suitability of individual donors are made with a number of factors in mind in the united states there are several viral diseases that all units are tested for before administration all potential donors complete detailed questionnaires the results of which may exclude individuals based on their history of travel and sexual behavior although tick-borne diseases are not currently routinely screened for a recent increase in human exposure to tick pathogens has lead to reinvestigation of this practice elimination of human donors because of travel history or region within the united states is impractical the potential for subclinical disease carriers and the possibility that the testing could be performed during the incubation period of the disease further complicates screening for tick-borne pathogens also many people who acquire tick-borne diseases have no recollection of tick exposure and there is a similar potential in pets4 similar concerns occur when selecting small animal donors human donors are screened for defined infectious agents at each donation this is infrequently performed in veterinary patients the appropriate interval for screening veterinary blood donors to date is undefined the type of donor situation may influence the frequency of testing ie closed colony donors vs volunteer-based programs it would be ideal to perform all screening tests on presentation and then again in 3 months for closed colonies this frequency should be adequate for volunteer donors annual testing should be performed all donors involved must receive monthly ectoparasite prophylaxis to limit exposure to vectors of disease transmission when screening donors it is essential to obtain a very thorough travel history before each donation to determine if additional infectious agents should be considered a physical examination should be performed at each donation because many subtle clinical signs of infectious disease ie fever anemia joint swelling can be noticed feline lukemia virus felv is an oncornavirus that is transmitted typically via saliva where concentration of the virus is highest viremic cats shed the virus constantly this is a disease that can be transmitted via blood transfusion if the donor is viremic all donor cats should be screened for felv regardless of previous testing before admission to a donor program5 the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa test for the p27 core antigen is the best screening test all positive cats should be excluded from blood donation6 cats that are free roaming should be excluded from donor programs given their constant potential exposure as well as the possibility of latent viral infection feline immunodeficiency virus fiv is a lentivirus that is transmitted via saliva or blood presumably by bite or fight wounds fiv has been transmitted experimentally via intravenous administration7 the ideal screening test for fiv is the elisa test for fiv-specific antibodies all positive cats should be excluded from blood donation as with felv cats that are free roaming should be excluded from donor programs given their constant potential exposure feline infectious peritonitis fip is a clinical syndrome induced by infection by some coronaviruses in a suitable host coronaviruses are primarily enteric pathogens that are primarily transmitted through virus-containing feces or saliva and close contact however based on reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr performed on blood it is known that both enteric and fip-inducing coronaviruses are present in the blood of some cats8 however rt-pcr test results cannot determine whether a cat will develop fip in addition to date there have been no reports of fip developing in a cat after administration of coronavirus-containing blood products currently available serological test results cannot discern whether a cat has been exposed to an enteric coronavirus or to a coronavirus capable of inducing fip because seroprevalence of coronavirus antibodies and prevalence of coronavirus viremia determined by rt-pcr are high serological or rt-pcr test results do not correlate with development of fip and fip has never been associated with a blood transfusion so that coronavirus serological or rt-pcr screening of feline donors is not currently recommended ehrlichiosis is caused by a group of obligate intracellular parasites of the genus ehrlichia of the family rickettsiaceae e canis-like dna 3 cats in north america and 2 cats in france has been amplified from naturally exposed cats by using pcr assays9 although morulae morphologically similar to e canis have been detected in mononuclear cells in some cats it is unknown if other organisms in this group infect cats10 11 attempts to induce e canis infection of cats experimentally have failed to date personal communication mr lappin 2004 antibodies that seroreact with e canis morulae were detected in the serum of 132 of 344 cats screened in the united states however it is currently unknown if these cats were truly infected by an ehrlichia spp12 some cats with pcr-confirmed e canis infections have been antibody negative and there is disagreement between laboratories on e canis-test results using feline serum9 because there is currently no standardization between serologic tests for e canis infection in cats and results have been variable use of these tests to determine the infection status of clinically healthy cats to be used as blood donors cannot currently be recommended detection of ehrlichia spp dna by pcr confirms current infection however in recent pcr-based studies e canis was not detected in the blood of feral cats in north central florida13 nor in the blood of cats used as blood donors in the united states14 in addition there have been no reports of feline ehrlichiosis acquired via blood transfusion thus ehrlichia spp infections of cats are probably rare most cats with clinical ehrlichiosis have had fever or cytopenias9 10 if a cat being screened for use as a blood donor has a history of these clinical abnormalities then it would be prudent to screen for ehrlichia spp infection by pcr of blood to lessen the risk of exposure to these agents community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicated although clinically ill cats respond to doxycycline or imidocarb treatment it is unknown whether infection is eliminated thus cats known to have been infected by an ehrlichia spp should not be used as blood donors in the future feline anaplasmosis is caused by anaplasma phagocytophilum the organism previously known as e equi human granulocytic ehrlichial agent e phagocytophila and the granulocytic ehrlichial agent of dogs15 16 experimentally infected cats developed morulae in neutrophils and eosinophils not mononuclear cells a phagocytophilum 5 cats in north america several cats in sweden denmark and the united kingdom has been amplified from naturally exposed cats by using pcr assays17 this infectious agent appears to be transmitted by ixodes ticks so cats in those regions of the united states should be considered at greater risk than cats in other regions there is one known case of transfusion-induced infection unpublished data mr lappin 2004 to date cats with clinical anaplasmosis have developed detectable titers but it is unknown how long positive titers persist because there is currently no standardization between serologic tests for a phagocytophilum infection in cats use of these tests to determine the infection status of clinically healthy cats to be used as blood donors cannot currently be recommended a phagocytophilum was not detected in the blood of 118 cats used as blood donors in the united states14 most cats with clinical anaplasmosis have had fever thrombocytopenia or a history of ixodes ticks17 if a cat being screened for use as a blood donor has a history of these clinical abnormalities then it would be prudent to screen for a phagocytophilum infection by pcr of blood to lessen the risk of exposure to this agent community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicated although clinically ill cats respond to treatment with doxycycline it is unknown whether infection is eliminated thus cats known to have been infected by a phagocytophilum should not be used as blood donors in the future cats have been experimentally infected with neorickettsia risticii previously e risticii and developed morulae in mononuclear cells16 18 some cats developed clinical signs of disease including fever depression lymphadenopathy anorexia and diarrhea in one seroepidemiological study antibodies that reacted with n risticii morulae were detected in 645 of 344 cats tested12 however n risticii has never been amplified by the blood of a naturally exposed cat the organism was not detected in the blood of 118 cats used as blood donors in the united states14 and there are no known cases of transfusion-induced infections in cats because there is currently no standardization between serologic tests for n risticii infection in cats use of serological tests to determine the infection status of clinically healthy cats to be used as blood donors cannot currently be recommended if a cat being screened for use as a blood donor is to be screened for e canis and a phagocytophilum infections by pcr then primers that also amplify the dna of n risticii should be used to lessen the risk of exposure to this agent community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicated cyauxzoonosis is caused by cytauxzoon felis a protozoan parasite in the order piroplasmida and family theileriidae the epizoology of c felis in the united states is relatively unknown though it is generally found in the southeastern united states ticks are believed to be the natural vector for transmission infections of naturally exposed cats and those induced experimentally by intravenous inoculation are almost invariably fatal there have been rare reports of the survival of cats naturally infected with c felis the explanation for the survival of these cats is unclear although innate immunity alternate virulent strain and a different signet-ring shaped piroplasm were all considered to be possibilities18 there is no serologic or pcr test commercially available for c felis and therefore examination of blood smears is the only diagnostic test readily available community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and placed on tick prophylaxis to minimize the likelihood of acquiring c felis cats are known to be infected by at least 4 bartonella spp including bhenselae b clarridgeiae b koehlerae and b weissii b henselae and b clarridgeaie are both associated with cat-scratch disease in people b henselae is a small curved gram-negative intraerythrocytic bacterium experimentally b henselae the organism has been transmitted between cats by c felis and by intravenous subcutaneous sq intramuscular and intradermal id inoculation naturally exposed cats and their fleas are commonly pcr positive for b henselae and b clarridgeaie17 a serologic survey of the united states and western canada revealed that overall 279 of healthy pet cats were seropositive with regional ranges varying from 69 to 56 table 1
19 in a study of cats used as community-practice blood donors in the united states 2 of 118 cats were pcr positive for b henselae14
 after infection by b henselae most cats become seropositive with a variable duration of bacteremia transient fever anorexia uveitis and peripheral lymphadenopathy are the most common clinical abnormalities recognized in both experimentally infected and naturally exposed cats20 currently the association between b henselae and other clinical diseases of cats such as gingivitis is being explored to date an association between feline blood transfusion and clinical bartonellosis has not been made detection of b henselae antibodies proves previous or current infection detection of bartonella spp by blood culture or pcr proves current infection primers are currently available that amplify many bartonella spp however the sensitivity of the assay in naturally exposed cats is unknown21 a pcr- or blood-culture- negative and antibody-negative cat is unlikely to be infected with b henselae cats to be used as blood donors with a previous history consistent with clinical bartonellosis or with a history of flea exposure should be screened for bartonellosis if negative flea control should be maintained during the time the cat is used as a blood donor if found to be positive in any test then the cat should be excluded from the blood-donor program because treatment does not consistently lead to the elimination of bacteremia feline hemoplasmosis previously hemobartonellosis is caused by mycoplasma hemofelis previously the large form or ohio strain and candidatus m hemominutum previously the small form or california strain22 23 24 these bacteria are associated with feline infectious anemia and can result in fever and severe hemolytic anemia in infected cats24 most m hemofelis isolates are more pathogenic than m hemominutum isolates but only limited numbers of isolates have been studied25 26 both hemoplasmas have been detected in the blood of cats and c felis taken from their bodies17 the cat flea has been shown to be a competent vector for m hemofelis27
 as little as 1 ml of blood from an chronically infected carrier cat can induce clinical illness in adult cats25 26 28 it is currently unknown how long stored feline blood containing hemoplasmas is infectious a recent study of 118 community-practice-based blood-donor cats in the united states showed 14 to be carrying one or both hemoplasms14
 there is no commercial serological test for feline hemoplasmosis cytological diagnosis is inaccurate in healthy cats with both false-positive and false-negative results being common it is well documented that the storage of whole blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid will lead to the organism falling off the associated red blood cell within 6 hours after storage pcr is now considered the test of choice for screening cats for hemoplasmosis a recent study documented positive results in 100 of experimentally inoculated cats versus 375 positive on peripheral blood smear from the same cats26 pcr assays that amplify the dna of both species are currently available commercially29
 cats to be used as community-practice blood donors should be screened for both hemoplasmas by pcr if negative then flea control should be maintained while the cat is being used as a blood donor if found to be positive for either species then the cat should be excluded from the blood-donor program because treatment with tetracyclines azithromycin or enrofloxacin does not consistently lead to the elimination of bacteremia25 26 28
 the ehrlichia sp are small gram-negative bacteria that are transmitted via tick bite dogs can be naturally infected by e canis most commonly e ewingii and e chafeensis dogs with ehrlichiosis will most commonly present with depression lethargy mild weight loss and anorexia potential exists for bleeding disorders many assymptomatic dogs will seroconvert after exposure clinical signs may develop months to years after initial exposure or they may never occur this provides the greatest challenge when screening potential blood donors serology ifa is the most widely used test for diagnosing ehrlichiosis dogs with titers of 180 are considered suspect for having ehrlichiosis and should be excluded from donor programs recently a commercial elisa test kit has become available for e canis for in-hospital use snap 3dx-idexx laboratories westbrook me this test has been shown to have overall agreement of 91 when compared with the ifa test although its sensitivity was lower when titers were 132031 interestingly this test is combined with an assay for dirofilaria immitis and borrelia burgdorfi it may be more cost effective to use this test during the initial screening dogs that have a negative result with the snap 3dx should have an ifa titer run to assure a negative titer ideally genus specific rt-pcr should be performed on dogs that are seronegative on ifa11 donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors there has only been one potential incident of transfusion-related transmission of a phagocytophium the etiologic agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in people32 canine anaplasmosis is also cause by a phagocytophilum it has been identified as the causative agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis33 clinical signs include anorexia lethargy conjunctivitis fever lameness and ataxia34 ifa serology is commonly used for the detection of a phagocytophilum infection in dogs with titers of 180 being considered seroreactive this test can frequently be false positive35 rt-pr has also been used to detect ehrlichial dna in infected dogs36 the potential for chronic carrier states exists therefore dogs that have tested positive for it should not be used as blood donors donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors dogs have been naturally infected with n risticii37 experimental infection via inoculation has been achieved as well38
n risticii has known cross-reactivity with e canis35 although individual serologic assays are available and should ideally be performed on screening donors the potential for chronic carrier states exists therefore dogs that have tested positive for it should not be used as blood donors donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors rocky mountain spotted fever is caused by the obligate intracellular parasite rickettsia rickettsi rocky mountain spotted fever differs from other rickettsial diseases in that it is an acute disease ie chronic carrier states with delayed-onset clinical signs is not reported patients with rocky mountain spotted fever will manifest clinical signs ie fever thrombocytopenia vasculitis etc with the clinical course of the disease typically running about 2 weeks or less39 dogs will however seroconvert to r rickettsii antigen without clinical illness these dogs have been shown to have rickettsial dna by using rt-pcr this may actually represent seroconversion against another unidentified organism in the spotted fever group rickettsiae30 physical examination and routine-screening laboratory testing should be sufficient to eliminate the likelihood of transmission 
babesia canis and b gibsoni are the 2 species of tick-borne hematozoan organisms that cause natural infection in the dog babesia is naturally transmitted by the bite of an infected ixodid tick after infection the host immune response may result in a chronic carrier state without significant clinical signs there are regional distribution ie the gulf coast and breed-susceptibility differences ie greyhounds pitt bull terriers that need to be considered when developing a testing plan39 40 a travel history should be acquired before each donation and retesting performed when indicated 
b microti is the most common reported transfusion-transmitted tick-borne disease in people41 42 43 most naturally occurring babesia infections are asymptomatic in people although not typical babesiosis can be fatal in immunosuppressed or geriatric patients which represent a large portion of the recipient pool41
 the diagnosis of clinical babesiosis relies on direct microscopy ifa serology or pcr healthy dogs can be carriers of babesiosis without significant parasitemia because direct microscopy relies on parasitemia this test is not likely to be useful as a screening test ifa is readily available and has a rapid turnaround the pcr is a more specific test and should be run on high-risk dogs that have a negative serology 
b canis has been transmitted and caused fulminant babesiosis acute hypotensive shock from an unscreened greyhound donor this dog responded to treatment for shock and treatment with clindamycin3 there is a recent report of a clinical case of transfusion-transmitted b gibsoni from an unscreened donor the recipient recovered from the initial hemolytic crisis although it remained infected with b gibsoni1 these reports illustrate the potentially devastating consequence of transfusion-associated babesiosis any potential donor with positive results from serologic screening or pcr testing should be excluded from the donor pool all donor dogs should be put on tick-preventative medications to minimize the likelihood of acquiring tick-borne diseases the leishmania donovani complex is a group of protozoan parasites that causes visceral leishmaniasis in dogs infected dogs can be reservoirs for infection in other dogs and people transmission of the disease is typically via sandflies in the mediterranean region this disease is rare in the united states with most cases associated with international travel sandflies are not present in the united states and the vector for endemic cases is unknown clinical diagnosis of leishmaniasis relies on direct microscopy serologic testing ifa and recently pcr given the low prevalence of the disease in the united states the decision to screen for this disease may be based on donor travel history and breed susceptibility as with babesiosis pcr testing should be performed in high-risk dogs that are seronegative foxhounds are over-represented in cases not associated with international travel interestingly a recent serologic survery showed that 29 33112 of foxhounds in a kennel were seroreactive to leishmania antigens whereas beagles and basset hounds housed in the same kennel were seronegative and pcr negative 03044
 there is a recent report of transmission of l infantum of the l donovani complex and the main cause of canine leishmaniasis to recipients of prbcs from infected foxhounds of 7 dogs that received infected prbc 3 developed serologic titers despite the development of titers not all dogs developed clinical illness2
 any potential donor with positive results on serologic screening or pcr testing should be excluded from the donor pool donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors 
trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan parasite that causes chagas disease this disease is more common in south and central america although it has been reported in the southeastern united states it is transmitted via insect vectors and has zoonotic potential chronic infection has been described a survey of dogs in oklahoma found that 36 of the healthy dogs surveyed were seropositive for t cruzi45 chagas disease has been transmitted via blood transfusion in dogs s barr personal communication january 2004 diagnostic tests available for chagas disease include direct microscopy protozoal culture serology radioimmunopreciptation assay ifa complement fixation and pcr again serology provides the most rapid answers but pcr should be considered in seronegative patients with travel history or in endemic areas given the possibility of chronic carrier states dogs that test positive should be excluded from the donor pool 
m hemocanis formerly hemobartonella canis is the agent that causes canine hemoplasmosis m hemocanis is transmitted by the brown dog tick it can be an incidental finding in healthy dogs but can cause anemia in dogs that are immunosuppressed or splenectomized39 there is a case report of a dog that developed clinical hemoplasmosis after simultaneously receiving a blood transfusion and splenectomy it is difficult to say whether this particular dog had m canis and developed signs after his spleen was removed or if he acquired h canis from the blood transfusion and was susceptible to it because of his splenectomy46 diagnosis of hemoplasmosis typically relies on visualization of the organism in red blood cells m canis can be detected with the pcr assay for h felis47 ideally a peripheral blood smear should be performed at the time of donation but detection in assymptomatic carriers may be difficult all donor dogs should be put on tick-preventative medications to minimize the likelihood of acquiring tick-borne diseases 
bartonella vinsonii ssp berkhoffii is a small curved gram-negative bacteria that is vector transmitted although the specific vector is unknown it causes clinical disease in dogs characterized by endocarditis peliosis hepatitis and granulomatous disease it has been experimentally transmitted by intravenous administration48 the prevalence of antibodies to b vinsonii has been found to be 36 in sick dogs49 50 and 87 in healthy dogs diagnosis relies on the detection of antibodies by elisa or ifa it is possible for a healthy animal to be seropositive there are experimental pcr assays available for bartonella species51
 
brucella canis is a gram-negative bacteria that causes reproductive disturbances and can cause bacteremia and discospondylitis in dogs it is typically transmitted venereally via penetration through urogenital mucous membranes there is no experimental transmission of b canis through intravenous inoculation donor dogs that are sexually intact should be tested annually with a rapid slide-agglutination test the tube-agglutination test is the confirmatory test of choice positive dogs should be excluded from the donor population ideally all dogs should be screened for babesiosis leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis when regionally appropriate because these diseases are transmitted via blood transfusion see table 2 table 3
serious consideration should be given to screening for ehrlichiosis anaplasmosis neorickettsiosis hemoplasmosis brucellosis and bartonellosis cats should be screened for retroviral infections and hemoplasmosis serious consideration should be given to screening for bartonellosis ehrlichiosis anaplasmosis neorickettsiosis and cytauxzoanosis these diseases provide a reasonable foundation on which to base a donor-screening program the answer to whether many of these diseases can truly be transmitted is unclear and the ultimate decision of what to include in a panel may rest in the cost of screening donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors a product should be selected that will result in rapid and efficient removal of ticks because disease transmission typically takes at least 24 to 72 hours of tick blood feeding51

 the first imported case of the disease in brazil was confirmed in february 2020 in the state of so paulo after a month the brazilian ministry of health moh recognized community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection throughout the national territory approximately 514000 confirmed cases of the disease were reported in brazil as of may 31 2020 including nearly 29000 deaths
2
  according to the moh because of the shortage of diagnostic tests most municipal monitoring systems have restricted testing to moderate-to-severe cases of covid-19 or those affecting health care professionals
3
 thus official statistics do not include mild or asymptomatic covid-19 cases it is estimated that up to 85 individuals infected with sars-cov-2 are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic
4
 mild or asymptomatic infections do not impact the health care system directly however individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection may infect others and may possibly develop a degree of immunity to reinfection therefore estimates of the total number of infected individuals in a region are important for health care planning projection of the epidemiological curve in the short and medium term scaling of demand for medical and hospital services and the establishment of expectations regarding group or herd immunity
5
  in may 2020 piau occupied the 20th position in the national ranking of brazilian states by covid-19 incidence
2
 it is possible that piau was in a delayed epidemic moment compared to other states of the federation data from the national civil aviation agency indicate that the state capital airport teresina has the second-lowest passenger flow in the country among the state capitals just ahead of aracaj airport in sergipe state which may in part justify this temporal difference
6
  given the possibility of the under-reporting of covid-19 cases and the impossibility of accounting for asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic sars-cov-2 infections through official records the municipal health foundation of teresina decided to perform sequential serological surveys this was intended to analyze the dynamics and dimension of the epidemic in the city plan health care interventions and project demand for hospital care  serologic surveys were performed in seven testing rounds conducted at 1-week intervals between april 19 and may 31 2020 each round comprised testing of 900 individuals under probability sampling they were stratified by sex age and geographical distribution in the city these data were extracted from the household registry of 78 basic health units in the urban area of the capital the study was approved by the national research ethics committee registry no 123444 after signing an informed consent form the individuals were tested using a rapid covid-19 test guangzhou wondfo biotech co china which was performed according to the manufacturers instructions regardless of the presence or duration of symptoms the diagnostic kit provides a qualitative result positive or negative however it does not differentiate immunoglobulin ig m and igg antibodies according to the manufacturer it has a sensitivity of 86 and a specificity of 99 only if it is performed at least 8 days after the infection and has been certified by the national institute for quality control in health  
figure 1 shows the timeline progression of the positivity rate in the population sampled with 95 confidence intervals cis and a significance of 5 from the third survey the central estimate of positivity was higher than the false-positive rate expected for the test 1-specificity in the fifth survey it possible to certify a significant increase in the seroprevalence in the population sampled p  001 with a positive result detected in 378 95 ci 263-524 of the individuals tested  

 the surveys reflected that sars-cov-2 infections are typically mild or asymptomatic and that data on reported cases does not represent the risk of infection up to 8 days before the completion of the seventh survey the municipality of teresina recorded 1699 confirmed covid-19 cases including 51 deaths
7
 given an estimated population of 864845 inhabitants according to the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge the seroprevalence in the seventh survey 833 95 ci 661-1033 suggests that 57166-89338 individuals had been infected in the capital this represents 33-53 persons infected for each reported case therefore the fatality rate of 3 calculated using the number of confirmed cases is overestimated and may reflect only the fatality rate among moderate-to-severe cases when considering the estimates for the total number of infected individuals the infection fatality rate varied between 006 and 009 the results of the serological surveys performed in teresina permit the estimation of the progression of the total number of infected individuals over the 7 weeks studied however future projections of results are limited given the low positivity in the sample the overlapping of cis that are attributable to the percentage of positive tests and the expected limit for false-positive results of the diagnostic tests therefore estimates of the cis of the reproduction number calculated between each round of the study were very imprecise however the sensitivity of a test is generally assessed by its manufacturer by testing samples from more severe cases with a diagnosis confirmed by methods considered a reference standard in these patients the immune response can be more exuberant which can lead to an overestimation of the tests sensitivity in addition the tests used in the present study detect total antibodies against sars-cov-2 the use of diagnostic tests capable of discriminating igg from igm positivity would more reliably reflect the emergence of the actual recent infections at every stage of the study although the dynamics of serological response to sars-cov-2 infection remains obscure  similar initiatives with state coverage have been implemented by researchers from the federal university of pelotas ufpel rio grande do sul state university and the federal university of piau state in partnership with the respective state public health departments however the positivity rates revealed in the initial stages have not exceeded the percentage of false-positive results estimated by the manufacturer of the diagnostic tests employed 1

 a study conducted in the municipality of so paulo detected a serologic positivity for sars-cov-2 in 5 of the individuals tested yet the sampling did not cover all neighborhoods of the city and was concentrated in the neighborhoods with the highest number of covid-19 cases
10
 in may 2020 a serological survey involving several brazilian cities was initiated by he ufpel which was endorsed by the moh with the participation of ibge
11
 in june 2020 a study performed in the state of rio de janeiro indicated that 28 blood donors had already produced antibodies against covid-19
12
 the results of the first nationwide seroprevalence study in spain showed that only 5 of the population had antibodies against sars-cov-2 based on a rapid antibody test
13
 serological screening is an important tool that is used to understand the immunity of a population and distinguish individuals who are at lower risk of becoming ill nevertheless even though the serologic positivity for sars-cov-2 reflects the detection of serum antibodies produced in response to infection the who recommends caution in drawing conclusions regarding temporary or permanent immunity against covid-19 in individuals with positive tests
14
 in the absence of a short-term expectation for the large-scale implementation of vaccines against covid-19 and considering the expected impact of the pandemic on the populations health knowledge of the immune status of the inhabitants of a region and the proportion of infected people who will require hospital equipment is essential for public health managers to plan appropriate interventions   serological approaches for covid-19 epidemiologic perspective on surveillance and control cheryl lee yi-pin raymond lin t laurent renia lisa ng f   the ongoing pandemic which originates from a newly emerged coronavirus sars-cov-2 was discovered in the city of wuhan in chinas hubei province in december 2019 1 to date due to rapid transmission globally there are more than two million laboratory-confirmed human infection cases with a few hundred thousand deaths across 210 countries and territories httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports this unprecedented crisis led to a worldwide effort to rapidly characterize the immunobiology of sars-cov-2 while mitigating further spread of this deadly pathogen sars-cov-2 is a single stranded positive sense rna virus that belongs to the coronaviridae family of the betacoronavirus genus 2 it has a genome size of 30 kilobases that encodes for multiple structural proteins comprising the spike s the envelope e the membrane m and the nucleocapsid n as well as non-structural proteins 3 figure 1 infection by sars-cov-2 causes an acute respiratory disease termed the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the clinical manifestations of covid-19 form a spectrum from being asymptomatic to fever with mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death from respiratory failure or associated complications 35 as the reported incubation period varies among different patient cohorts it is often difficult to ascertain the actual day of onset and infected subjects who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic may go undetected 57 early detection of sars-cov-2 infection is one of the crucial interventions to control virus transmission with the discovery of the virus numerous diagnostic assays using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr qrt-pcr were developed 3 qrt-pcr is the reference standard for diagnosing infections with high sensitivity and accuracy in the acute phase of illness sars-cov-2 viral rna has been detected in both throat and nasal swabs of infected individuals by qrt-pcr which becomes almost undetectable by 14 days post-illness onset pio or symptom onset 8 9 figure 2 apart from being costly and time consuming to perform false negative results may arise due to improper handling of nucleic acid samples inadequate and variable sampling resulting in insufficient viral genetic material at the point of detection after 14 days pio or biological variation on when viral rna is detectable by qrt-pcr 10 15 with the limitations of qrt-pcr immunoassays may offer another avenue to reduce undiagnosed cases with the advantage that rapid test formats may deliver results in a relatively shorter time and lower cost 10 in recent pre-prints deposited in medxriv and bioxriv it was shown that both anti-sars-cov-2-igm and igg levels increase gradually along with infection phases with igm being detected as early as 3 days pio which peaks between two to three weeks pio 10 11 one study has reported that sars-cov-2-specific igm is still present in the serum after 1 month pio 12 sars-cov-2-specific igg antibodies on the other hand can be present as early as 4 days pio and peak after 17 days pio 10 11 figure 2 these observations are similar to what was previously reported during a sars-cov infection 21 however interestingly one study demonstrated that longitudinal profiling of both antibodies in a population of 63 covid-19 patients showed no specific chronological order in terms of igm and igg seroconversion 10 which was also observed in patients infected with sars-cov and another human coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 22 23 in addition there seems to be no correlation between seroconversion rates with age gender or time of hospitalization 10 these findings on sars-cov-2-specific antibodies seroconversion against the s viral protein suggest the importance to test for both igm and igg antibodies to confirm a positive infection expectedly similar to what was reported for sars-cov and mers-cov both igm and igg levels seems to be correlated with disease severity with a higher level of both antibodies present in patients with more severe sars-cov-2 infection 10 11 14 2426 in contrast to other flu-like infections such as influenza instead of igg1 igg3 appears to be the dominant igg subtype during sars-cov-2 infection 13 27 28 as a majority of the human population has prior exposure to endemic human coronavirus infections including alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 and other betacoronaviruses oc42 and hku1 29 it is crucial to validate the specificity and sensitivity of current immunoassays against sars-cov-2 to avoid false positive outcomes within the s protein antigen cross-reactivity was observed when samples were tested against sars-cov s and s1 subunit proteins and to a smaller extent with mers-cov s protein table 1 interestingly there was no cross-reactivity with the s1 subunit of mers-cov 14 the high level of cross-reactivity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 can be attributed to the high degree of genetic homology 3 14 19 furthermore detailed analysis revealed a highly conserved s2 subunit domain across coronaviruses which may explain for the cross-reactivity observed with only the s protein of mers-cov and not with the s1 subunit 14 19 these data suggest that using an s1 subunit-based immunoassay may be more specific than the entire s antigen for diagnosing sars-cov-2 infections another immunogenic target the rbd which lies along the s protein is usually the target of many neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov 30 a substantial level of cross-reactivity by sars-cov rbd-induced antibodies to sars-cov-2 rbd was described table 1 20 of clinical relevance these antibodies were also able to cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 pseudovirus infection signifying the potential of an immunotherapy-based treatment 20 while one non-peer reviewed study has shown that rbd-based serological assays are more sensitive than s1 subunit-based assays in identifying antibodies in mild covid-19 patients 14 other non-peer-reviewed studies have described a lower degree of antibody response to the rbd as compared to full-length s protein plausibly reflecting the larger number of epitopes present on the larger s antigen 13 19 due to a high level of similarity of 90 between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 n proteins the n antigen of sars-cov was also used for serological detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibodies table 1 14 these n-based assays were reported to be more sensitive than s1 subunit-based tests 14 the use of sars-cov antigens to diagnose sars-cov-2 infections may be reliable given that sars-cov has not circulated in the human population since 2004 3 in addition an earlier report has demonstrated waning of sars-cov-specific antibodies therefore being undetectable in 91 of patient serum samples after 6 years 31 since respiratory diseases are the hallmark of coronavirus infections which activate mucosal immunity several studies have exploited the detection of iga to diagnose sars-cov-2 infection in patients table 1 13 14 although a strong iga response was also detected in covid-19 patients where peak seroconversion was achieved by two weeks pio figure 2 iga-based immunoassay has been hypothesized to be less specific than igg-based elisa due to cross-reactivity with serum samples from patients infected by other coronaviruses 14 with the availability of immunoassays utilizing various coronavirus structural proteins the use of more than one different antigen-based serological approach may be essential to establish a true positive sars-cov-2 infection in addition the use of saliva samples and other bodily fluid swabs as a less invasive alternative which have been done for other viral infections including hiv and measles should also be explored for serological testing of sars-cov-2 infections 32 33 apart from using immunoassays for the early detection of sars-cov-2 infected individuals it is also critical to determine the regions where sars-cov-2-specific antibodies bind to help guide vaccine designs using sars-cov-derived b-cell epitopes that have been experimentally identified from positive b-cell assays 34 49 out of 298 linear b-cell epitopes have an identical match with sars-cov-2 protein sequences without any mutations 3 notably majority of these matches were located at both the s and n viral antigens with only 4 from the m protein and none in the e protein 3 on the other hand 6 conformational b-cell epitopes identified from the same database were located on the s antigen however unlike the linear epitopes none of these mapped identically to the sars-cov-2 protein 3 further mapping the residues of linear b-cell epitopes onto available sars-cov s protein structure revealed several regions on the s2 subunit that may allow cross-neutralization of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3 35 in contrast conformational b-cell epitopes mapped onto the s1 subunit resulting in very few identical residues within sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3 these findings indicate that sars-cov-specific antibodies targeting these discontinuous regions may not be able to cross-react with sars-cov-2 3 36 as these regions are computationally predicted serological studies using patient samples are necessary to validate the importance of these regions for serology and in controlling sars-cov-2 infection it also remains imperative to identify other sars-cov antibodies that may recognize the conformational epitopes of sars-cov-2 s protein which can greatly reduce the amount of time needed to develop novel neutralizing antibodies the findings derived from serological assays can provide valuable information that would help to support the diagnosis treatment and prevention of sars-cov-2 infections characterization of antibody profiles suggested that any suspected individuals with undetectable antibody levels against sars-cov-2 after 20 days pio may be a true negative case since both anti-sars-cov-2 igm or igg seroconversion should have already occurred 10 11 however these findings may be limited to the relatively small sample size 300 patients and may require further validation with a larger cohort in order to reinforce diagnosis it would be advisable to perform multiple assays against different viral antigen in addition the information of antibody seroconversion is crucial in determining the optimal timepoints to collect serum or plasma samples for immunoassay screening as well as obtaining peripheral blood b cells for the generation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 37 currently in order to rapidly generate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov-2 repurposing of existing sars-cov-specific antibodies was demonstrated to date two human sars-cov-specific antibodies cr3022 and 47d11 have been shown to recognize sars-cov-2 38 39 cr3022 recognizes an epitope along the rbd of sars-cov-2 which differs largely at the c-terminus residues to the rbd of sars-cov 38 unfortunately this variation in sequence impacted the ability of cr3022 to cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 monoclonal antibody 47d11 on the other hand targets the rbd along the s1 subunit of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with similar affinities thereby enabling cross-neutralization against sars-cov-2 infection 39 while combinatory therapy has exhibited a stronger neutralization capability against sars-cov infection 40 a cocktail antibody approach for sars-cov-2 could be explored surprisingly reports on antibodies against the coronavirus e protein are scarce possibly due to it being the smallest protein however the e antigen is involved in viral assembly release of virions as well as virus pathogenesis 41 it was demonstrated that recombinant coronaviruses lacking the e protein displayed significantly reduced viral titers impaired viral maturation and produced avirulent virus progenies suggesting a similar importance of e protein during sars-cov-2 infection 42 43 thus it would be worthwhile to identify or generate neutralizing antibodies that are specific against the viral e protein during the course of an epidemic one of the main challenges is the identification of asymptomatic infection since these individuals do not present any distinguishable symptoms they could be the major source of transmission 10 immunoassays may be able to detect mildly infected cases 14 which is important to ascertain the extent of community spread while it is fast robust and easy to perform there are several limitations to serological assays one of the major setbacks of immunoassays is the inability to detect the presence of infection during the early stage of disease as antibodies take several days to be generated after exposure to foreign material 44 as such a recent infection may provide false negative results during serological testing thus the use of rt-pcr may be more suitable to diagnose an early acute sars-cov-2 infection furthermore due to the unique genetic makeup of each individual there would be an inherent variability of the antibody response 45 this could possibly explain the difference in antibody profiles elicited among individuals infected with sars-cov-2 10 cross-reactivity could potentially be a limitation of immunoassays as it severely impacts the specificity and sensitivity of the test although the phylogenetically closest coronavirus sars-cov has not been reported to be circulating in the human population since 2004 3 other endemic human coronaviruses may still pose a problem to accurately diagnose patients with true sars-cov-2 infection while a recent study has demonstrated negligible cross-reactivity from human coronavirus nl63 to sars-cov-2 13 validation with other human coronaviruses remains to be investigated in addition prior findings on the s protein sequence and neutralization antigenicity of other coronaviruses suggest that antibodies neutralizing clinical human coronavirus isolates may not have the same degree of cross-reactivity with laboratory strains of human coronaviruses thereby affecting the sensitivity of immunoassays 4648 given the rapid increase in the number of confirmed covid-19 cases coupled with the shortage in test kits to meet rising demands decentralized point-of-care tests poct may be another alternative to facilitate sars-cov-2 diagnosis such tests include lateral flow assay lfa which is a paper-based platform for the detection and quantification of analytes in complex mixtures 49 to design lfa for sars-cov-2 detection an antibody specific to the viral antigen or a viral antigen that is detectable by patient serum or plasma samples can be immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane detection of binding between the analyte and capture antibody by a detector antibody will give rise to a colored line closely resembling home pregnancy kits 50 poct is advantageous as it is usually designed to be rapid sensitive highly accessible and easily performed requiring only a small amount of sample 50 meanwhile several hundreds of candidate pocts are being evaluated for their applicability toward identifying sars-cov-2-infected individuals 50 however pocts cant replace rt-pcr and it is crucial that these developing tests are rigorously assessed prior to use it is important to note that wrong use and interpretation could lead to disastrous public health consequences 51 rapid development of diagnostic tools and immune-based assays are important early interventions against the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic the availability of serological assays that target a diverse range of viral antigen has no doubt assisted in the accurate diagnosis of covid-19 patients essentially data generated through serological studies can greatly aid in supplementing the results from qrt-pcr as well as contribute to seroepidemiology which has been shown to help in the design of virus elimination programs 52 moving forward this extensive collation of the current immunoassays against sars-cov-2 will provide insights toward monoclonal antibodies discovery and characterization for the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine ln and lr conceived the presented idea cl wrote the manuscript and prepared the figures ln lr and rl revised the manuscript all authors approved this manuscript for publication the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  infectious disease surveillance in captive and free-living cheetahs an integral part of the species survival plan evermann et al james evermann f m laurenson karen alison mckeirnan j t car0 m  during the formulative stages of developing the species survival plan ssp for the cheetah the impact of infectious disease upon its survival in captivity was of prime consideration together with genetics nutrition physiology and behavior this paper summarizes the results of an infectious disease surveillance program initially designed to monitor the infectious agents associated with clinically normal and clinically ill cheetahs in captivity but subsequently supplemented with data from free-living cheetahs the focus was on two viral infections feline infectious peritonitis fip and feline rhinotracheitis virus results indicated that between 1989 and 1991 there was an increase in the seroprevalence number antibody-positive animals of cheetahs to feline coronavirus from 41 to 64 in captivity during this same time period there were only two documented cases of fip in cheetahs in the united states the results suggest that feline coronavirus feline enteric coronavirus-feline infectious peritonitis group or a closely related coronavirus of cheetahs is becoming endemic in the captive cheetah population further serologic results from 39 free-living cheetahs demonstrated that there was a high seroprevalence 61 to feline coronavirus although serum antibody titers were considerably lower than those encountered in captive cheetahs the observation of a high percentage of free-living cheetahs which were seropositive to feline herpesvirus 44 was unexpected since it has been generally regarded that this infection is primarily associated with cheetahs in captivity 0 1993 wiley-liss inc  cheetahs are endangered in the wild as a result of increasing human agricultural encroachment on their habitat and direct persecution of them and their prey in order to provide a buffer to dwindling wild populations a concerted effort has been launched by north american zoos to keep a self-sustaining population in captivity unfortunately low reproductive rates and continued depletion from adult mortality has made this goal difficult to attain at present however in november 1989  the cheetah species survival plan ssp was started to investigate problems of maintaining a viable population in captivity grisham and lindburg 1989 marker and obrien 19891 one protocol was to monitor the health of captive cheetahs and to sample them for the occurrence of infectious microorganisms which may have a negative impact upon their survival in captivity during the initial phase of the disease surveillance study serum samples together with swabs andor tissues from normal and diseased cheetahs were solicited for viral antibody determination and viral culture the purposes of this paper are to bring together the serological results compiled over the past three years and to present perspectives on the ecology of infectious agents in the cheetahs environment although emphasis will be placed upon two viral infections feline infectious peritonitis fip and feline rhinotracheitis other infectious agents may also have a detrimental effect upon the survival of the cheetah in captivity  barr et al 1989 baxby et al 1982 letcher and oconner 1991 sabine and hyne 19701  serum samples were collected from captive and wild-caught cheetahs as previously reported evermann et al 1988 heeney et al 19901  the serum was separated from the blood clot and stored at -20c until used in serologic assays the indirect immunofluorescent antibody lfa serologic assay was used to evaluate cheetah serum for antibodies to the feline coronavirus group feline infectious peritonitisfeline enteric coronavirusicanine coronavirusitransmissible gastroenteritis virus the ifa had been shown to correlate well with western blot serology comparing coronavirus antibody titers in domestic cats and in cheetahs heeney et al 19901  ifa antibody titers l 125 were regarded as positive the virus neutralization vn assay was used to determine antibody titers to feline herpesvirus fhv type 1 vn antibody titers 2 12 were regarded as positive earlier work had demonstrated that fhv was closely related to the herpesvirus isolated from cheetah cubs with advanced facial cutaneous ulcers junge et al 1991 scherba et al 19883  and from adult cheetahs succumbing to diseases heretofore unrelated to herpesvirus infection evermann and mckeirnan 19911  the ssp surveillance of feline coronavirus infection in captive cheetahs commenced in 1989 table 1 presents a summary of the seroreactivity of captive cheetahs to the feline coronavirus group in 1989 there were 48 accessions which amounted to 102 samples tested 42 412 of which were seropositive in 1990 there were more accessions for a total of 164 serum samples tested of which 106 646 were seropositive in the third year of the study 1991 there were 81 accessions and 194 serum samples tested of these 125 644 were seropositive to the feline coronavirus group these results were analyzed further by comparing the distribution of serum antibody titers amongst the three years table 2  there were three categories established based upon the serum titer levels these were seronegative ifa titers  125 seropositive normal range ifa titers 125 to 13125 and seropositive watch ifa titers 2 115625 it was observed that there was a change in serum antibody titer distribution from the first year 1989 of the study compared with the succeeding two years the number of seronegative cheetahs dropped from 588 in 1989 to 359 in 1990 this percentage remained constant throughout 1991 concurrent with the decrease in seronegative cheetahs was the increase in seropositive cheetahs in the normal serum titer range 352 in 1989 to 597 in 1990 and 628 in 1991  the number of cheetahs in the watch category decreased from 6 in 1989 to 3 in 1991 during this period of time there were 2 deaths attributed to fip both animals had serum titers in the watch category in a parallel study of free-living cheetahs immobilized and sampled in the course of radio collaring caro in press laurenson and caro in press  samples were collected from 39 cheetahs sixty-one percent were seropositive to feline coronavirus  table 3  only free-living cheetahs were included in this portion of the study since the majority of captive cheetahs in the united states are vaccinated with combination vaccines containing feline herpesvirus feline calicivirus  and feline panleukopenia virus wack 19911  the results table 3 indicated that there was a high rate of seropositivity to feline herpesvirus 436 the surveillance of infectious disease microorganisms affecting the cheetah has focused upon just two agents on the basis of prior disease epizootics with fip and the isolation of feline herpesviruses from several cases during the course of the current study evermann et al 1988 evermann et al  1989 evermann and mckeirnan 1991 junge et al 19911  the results of the coronavirus serology reflected a trend toward a more endemic infection occurring in the captive cheetah populations of the united states infection rates of 644 are similar to those observed in some domestic cats housed in catteries 40-85 pedersen 19911 during the course of this study there were only two cases of fip reported in the cheetah population which may indicate one of several things this low level of fip mortality may be indicative of the control efforts that have been used in various cheetah collections based upon serologic-directed quarantine the changing virulence of the feline-cheetah coronavirus in nature the lowered number of coronavirus-naive cheetahs in captivity or a combination of the above the earlier findings of feline herpesvirus infection being associated with clinically ill as well as clinically normal cheetahs is compatible with our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this virus in domestic cat populations povey 19861  the isolation of feline herpesvirus from a clinically normal cheetah confirms that asymptomatic shedding can occur and may account for the infection of susceptible animals especially cubs evermann and mckeirnan 19911 the serologic profile of the 39 free-living cheetahs points to several interesting observations first it exemplifies the use of serologic testing for surveillance purposes to assess the degree of infection within a given population of animals hancock 1988 heeney et al 1990 horzinek and osterhaus 1979 munson 19911  second the high seroprevalence of feline coronavirus antibodies 615 indicates that a coronavirus of cheetahs is endemic in at least one cheetah population living in east africa this observation supports the earlier reports of coronavirus seropositive cheetahs in the wild evermann et al 1988 horzinek and osterhaus 19791  the fact that certain populations of cheetahs either in captivity or in the wild have remained seronegative to feline coronavirus may be reflective of the lack of exposure to a cheetah coronavirus or to the other coronaviruses known to cross-react with the feline coronaviruses ie porcine coronavirus and canine coronavirus spencer 19911 the third observation indicates a high seroprevalence of free-living cheetahs to feline herpesvirus 436 previously considered to be predominantly an infection and disease of captive cheetahs the occurrence of seroreactive cheetahs in the wild raises many questions in regards to the ecology of these viruses and the practicality of trying to maintain colonies of cheetahs that are free of infection it is clear that more needs to be known about the ecology of these viruses in nature in order to implement control measures for their control in captive cheetah populations morse 19911  anderson  19911 recently posed the question pertaining to populations and infectious diseases of whether one should refer to it as ecology or epidemiology in reality it is both since there is considerable overlap when studying the ecology of a virus the questions asked are how does the virus persist in nature at the cellular level host animal level and at the population level anderson and may 1986 mahy 19851  pathogenesis refers to the potential for the virus to cause disease at the host animal level which invariably involves target organs and preferential cells for virus replication epidemiology is the study of the ecology of an infectious agent in order to understand the pathogenesis and ultimately control it control may occur by culling of infected animals segregation to reduce infection and thereby minimize disease and vaccination if one exists table 4 presents the ecology of feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline herpesvirus based upon current information the control of feline coronavirus infections in domestic cats and cheetahs has historically relied upon initial serologic testing segregation and periodic serologic testing to monitor the effectiveness of the control program addie and jarret 1990 evermann et al 1988 evermann et al  1991 hoskins 1991 pedersen 19911  the placement of domestic cats in small family units of five to six animals has also been an effective control measure for control of fip in endemic catteries evermann and ott unpublished data  the apparent increase in seroprevalence of captive cheetahs from 1989 to 1991 suggests that segregation may not be totally effective in reducing infection however there has been a noticeable reduction in the clinical cases of fip which may reflect a form of natural immunization with a feline-cheetah coronavirus as the infection becomes more endemic in captive cheetahs the control of fip in domestic cats has been augmented by the recent development of a modified-live temperature-sensitive fip virus vaccine postorino et al 19921  the vaccine appears to be safe and the effectiveness ranges from 40 to 80 depending on the strain of fip virus that is used to challenge the cats the vaccine has not yet been tested for safety in cheetahs the efficacy of such a vaccine should only be studied in a collection of captive cheetahs that is endemic for feline coronavirus due to the hazards of experimental challenge in an endangered species evermann and mckeirnan 19911 the control of feline herpesvirus infections has been dependent upon a combination of good hygiene decreased population density and an aggressive vaccination program at least twice per year evermann and mckeirnan 1991 povey 1986 wack 19911  the feline herpesvirus is usually shed when the cats have clinical signs such as rhinitis and conjunctivitis povey 19861  the pathogenesis of feline herpes-virus in cheetahs appears to be similar to that described in domestic cats evermann and mckeirnan 19911  the immune response to the feline herpesvirus is dependent upon maternal antibodies for the first 8 to 12 weeks and then for continual boosting from either natural exposure or vaccination to maintain protective levels of immunity spencer and burroughs 1991 1992 wack 19911  the experiences observed with infectious diseases of cheetahs in particular the feline coronavirus and feline herpesvirus infections raises some questions pertaining to the factors which influence the susceptibility of these animals to infection and the severity of disease in selected individuals according to pedersen  199 11  there are many factors which influence the outcome of infections these include the host response the environment in which the host lives and microbial agents to which the host is exposed of particular interest with regard to the cheetah are those factors of the host response primarily those pertaining to developmental and heritable anomalies of the immune system obrien and evermann 1988 reviewed reports on the genetic homogeneity of the cheetah and postulated that this homozygosity may reflect lack of immunologic diversity to infectious agents in a series of experiments the immune response of the cheetah has been reported as being suboptimal based on the lack of rejection of skin grafts and the lack of demonstrable neutralizing antibodies to fip virus mckeirnan and evermann unpublished data obrien et al 19851 pedersen 1987 cautions against the use of skin testing for measuring the effectiveness of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in domestic cats although cats do not respond well to some antigens they have been shown to develop measurable levels of delayed hypersensitivity to certain chemicals nonetheless there appears to be some differences in the cell-mediated immune response of domestic cats as measured by decreased lymphocyte reactivity to t-cell mitogens and this observation may apply to cheetahs as well recent evidence now supports the altered t-cell function of the cheetah miller-edge and worley 19921  in that study there was a decrease in t-cell responsiveness of cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells when compared with domestic cats when the cells were cultured with inactivated feline herpesvirus these experiments as well as those of other investigators suggest that the susceptibility of the cheetah to viral infections and the severity of disease are the result of an immune-compromised host miller-edge and worley 19911  this understanding will allow for us to pursue strategies for augmenting the cheetahs immune response which should include genetics as well as managing cheetahs to reduce the risk of high exposure to potentially fatal pathogens and the development of effective and safe vaccines to aid in the control of such diseases hohdatsu et al 1991 lin 19921  we express our

sars-cov-2 serologic assays mei tang san karl hock g nicole logsdon m jennifer hayes e ann gronowski m neil anderson w christopher farnsworth w  the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has resulted in a rapid proliferation of serologic assays however little is known about their clinical performance here we compared two commercial sars-cov-2 igg assays methods 103 specimens from 48 patients with pcr confirmed sars-cov-2 infections and 153 control specimens were analyzed using sars-cov-2 serologic assays by abbott and euroimmun ei duration from symptom onset was determined by medical record review diagnostic sensitivity specificity and concordance were calculated  the abbott sars-cov-2 assay had a diagnostic specificity of 994 95 ci 9641-9998 and sensitivity of 00 95 ci 000-2647 at 3 days post symptom onset 300 95 ci 1189-5428 at 3-7d 478 95 ci 2682-6941 at 8-13d and 938 95 ci 8280-9869 at 14d diagnostic specificity on the ei assay was 948 95 ci 8996-9772 if borderline results were considered positive and 967 95 ci 9254-9893 if borderline results were considered negative the diagnostic sensitivity was 00 95 ci 000-2647 at 3d 250 95 ci 866-4910 at 3-7d 565 95 ci 3449-7681 at 3-7d and 854 95 ci 7224-9393 at 14d if borderline results were considered positive the qualitative concordance between the assays was 083 95 ci 075-091 the abbott sars-cov-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the ei assay however diagnostic sensitivity was poor in both assays during the first 14 days of symptoms  there has been a rapid proliferation of serologic tests for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the causative pathogen of the ongoing coronavirus 2019 covid- 19 pandemic in contrast to the mandatory emergency use authorization eua that regulates molecular testing for sars-cov-2 the fda did not originally mandate eua for regulation of serologic tests resulting in a rapid expansion in sars-cov-2 serologic tests with unknown clinical performance there have been many suggested uses of sars-cov-2 serology including seroprevalence studies and determination of immune status many of the studies that have attempted to examine these utilities have suffered from small sample size 1 andor have been published in non-peer reviewed preprint servers 2 3  some professional societies have also issued recommendations but there has been no consensus so far on the primary indications of serology 4  for example the infectious diseases society of america idsa suggests that serology may be useful in 1 patients with clinical symptoms highly suggestive of sars-cov-2 but who are covid rna negative 2 selection of convalescent plasma donors 3 evaluation of vaccine responses and 4 epidemiologic studies 5  both the idsa and the who have strongly cautioned against associating positive serology with immunity 6  since convalescent plasma has been used with some success to treat covid-19 patients antibodies are presumed to be protective against sars-cov-2 7 8 9  nonetheless the epitope specificity and titer required to achieve immunity have still not been established igg andor igm are typically measured in infectious disease antibody response although iga has also been utilized in some available sars-cov-2 assays at the time of writing of the 12 serologic assays that have received eua 5 assays measure igg only 3 assays measure both igm and igg and 4 assays measure total immunoglobulins 10  longitudinal antibody tang 4 studies have demonstrated conflicting results about anti-sars-cov-2 igm and igg titers throughout the course of disease 11 12  furthermore the appropriate antigen to use for detection of circulating antibodies against sars-cov-2 has not yet been defined several manufacturers have designed assays that measure antibodies targeted against the viral spike protein which mediates entry of sars-cov-2 into host cells 13 or the nucleocapsid protein which is a highly immunogenic structural protein 14  there is considerable homology between sars-cov-2 and other seasonal coronaviruses making antigen selection for immunoassays crucial for high specificity to date no comparison of commercial elisas for sars-cov-2 antibodies exists in the peerreviewed literature furthermore due to the high demand for these assays during the pandemic validations by some manufacturers has been abbreviated here we compared the performance of two sars-cov-2 igg antibody assays from abbott and euroimmun ei test specimens this investigation was approved by the institutional review board of washington university in st louis mo residual patient specimens that had been sent to the barnes jewish hospital laboratory for physician-ordered complete blood count in edta vacutainer tubes bd were utilized a subset of serum specimens obtained in 2015 and stored at -80c before the emergence of sars-cov-2 was used as control specimens given the lack of clear guidance from professional societies regarding the utility of serologic assays the validation protocol assumed that the primary purpose of testing would be for population-based screening ie epidemiologic studies or screening asymptomatic patients tang 5   and for patients who present 10d after symptom onset who are pcr negative 103   specimens from 48 patients with confirmed covid-19 infections and 153 presumed negative specimens were analyzed control specimens included 80 patients who were symptomatic but pcr negative for sars-cov-2 50 serum specimens collected and frozen in 2015 before the emergence of sars-cov-2 5 specimens from patients with other coronaviruses confirmed by molecular testing but pcr negative for covid-19 including coronaviruses hku1 nl63 and 229e and 4 specimens from patients with influenza a or b 14 specimens with potentially interfering antibodies were also included 5 were positive for cmv igg 3 were positive for ebv vca igg 3 were positive for ebv vca igm 2 were positive for both ebv vca igg and igm and 1 was positive for rheumatoid factor clinical information duration from symptom onset was determined by review of the electronic medical record from two independent assessors and inferred from physician encounter notes symptoms were defined as chief complaint of the current encounter the primary symptoms included respiratory ie shortness of breath cough fever loss of taste or smell headache and sore throat 15  underlying medical conditions that could influence humoral immunity were documented when possible igg directed against the s1 domain of viral spike protein both assays rely on an assayspecific calibrator to report a ratio of specimen absorbance to calibrator absorbance the final interpretation of positivity is determined by ratio above a threshold value abbotts assay can be interpreted as positive ratio 14 or negative ratio 14 while eis assay can be interpreted as positive ratio 11 borderline ratio 11 to 08 or negative ratio 08 quality controls qc as supplied by the manufacturer were analyzed on each day of testing for interference studies hemolysis index icteric and lipemic index were determined on a roche e 602 analyzer roche according to manufacturers instructions presence or absence of sars-cov-2 infections were adjudicated by detection of sars-cov-2 viral rna from nasopharyngeal np swabs oropharyngeal op swabs or lower respiratory tract specimens tested in the barnes jewish hospital laboratory with assays validated for clinical use due to reagent shortages multiple platforms were used to assess the presence of sars-cov-2 rna the quidel lyra rt-pcr assay that detects the sars-cov-2 non-structural polyprotein pp1ab was the primary method used limit of detection 800 copiesml some patients were adjudicated based on results from molecular testing using the xpert xpress sars-cov-2 molecular assay cepheid limit of detection 250 copiesml and the simplexa covid-19 direct assay using a liaison mdx diasorin lower respiratory tract specimens only limit of detection 500 copiesml remnant specimens were obtained and frozen at -80c in 500 l aliquots until analysis each specimen was thawed within 24h of analysis the same aliquot was used for both assays assay validation and precision precision studies were performed using a modified version of the clsi ep12-a2 guidelines 16  for precision studies qc materials positive and negative as supplied by abbott and ei were analyzed a patient pool from a single positive patient was also diluted into negative control plasma to a concentration near the positive cutoff for both assays repeatability was assessed by analyzing 20 replicates on one day on the abbott assay owing to limited reagent availability repeatability was assessed with 10 replicates on one day with the ei assay total imprecision was assessed in duplicate over 5 days interference was assessed for hemolysis icterus and lipemia using plasma from two positive patients diluted into pools from a single negative patient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for each assay were calculated using molecular testing as the gold standard for the ei assay sensitivity and specificity were calculated assuming that a borderline result was a positive or negative based on guidelines to manufacturers by the fda 17  however given the concern for false positive results borderline results are primarily reported as positives time from pcr was also used to calculate sensitivity and specificity one patient was pcr- but clinically adjudicated as covid-19 and was positive by both immunoassays therefore a separate specificity analysis was performed for this discrepant specimen 5  concordance was calculated using cohens kappa and percent agreement for determining time to onset of symptoms a sigmoidal 4-parameter logistic regression was used to fit the data and interpolate the days to positivity for all patients who mounted an immune response patients who did not mount immune responses were excluded sigmoidal modeling was chosen based on the kinetics of immune response by 12 patients monitored serially all statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 8 the total diagnostic specificity of the abbott assay was 994 95 ci 9641-9998  figure   1a  the diagnostic sensitivity at  3d of symptoms was 00 95 ci 000-2647 at 3-7d 300 95 ci 1189-5428 and at 8-13d was 478 95 ci 2682-6941 for patients with 14d of symptoms or more the sensitivity was 938 95 ci 8280-9869 using the time from the positive sars-cov-2 pcr result the sensitivity from 3d post-pcr testing was 476 95 ci 3200-6358 for 3-7d was 591 95 ci 3635-7929 for 8-13d was 696 95 ci 4708-8679 and for 14d was 813 95 ci 5435-9595 on the abbott assay  figure 1b  1227 patients would have been positive by serologic testing if tested simultaneously with pcr in patients who were simultaneously tested for serology and molecular testing ie 0d the mean time to symptoms in the specimens from serologically positive patients was 122d median  14d while the mean time to symptoms was 33d table 1  there were four discordant results between the serologic assays and molecular testing of the three patients who did not mount an antibody response by day 14 on both assays 2 were on chemotherapy for leukemia the third had no noted immunodeficiency but was previously diagnosed with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency one patient gray circle with an x  figures 1 and 2 was negative by molecular testing but positive by both immunoassays this patient was clinically adjudicated as covid-19 with greater than 10d of classical covid symptoms fever headache loss of taste and smell and with multiple exposures to family members with confirmed covid if this patient was excluded from analysis the diagnostic specificity of the abbott assay was 100 95 ci 97 6 the third discordant positive on the ei was from a specimen collected pre-pandemic the kinetics of igg seroconversion was evaluated using specimens from 12 patients with serial results supplemental figure 1  a nonlinear regression fit of the data from symptom onset vs signal revealed a positive igg result by 95d 95 ci 83-104 on the abbott sars-cov-2 assay and 127d 95 ci 123-141 on the ei assay figure 4  serial dilutions of a tang 10 single specimen on both assays revealed a linear curve supplemental figure 2  the abbott assay remained positive to a titer of 116 while the ei remained positive to 132 and was borderline at 164 for the abbott sars-cov-2 assay repeatability and total imprecision of the signal for the positive qc and patient pool were  2 and the agreement of the qualitative results was 100 supplemental table 2  repeatability and total imprecision for the ei were cv 373 and 416 respectively for the positive qc and cv 961 and 1225 for the patient pool and the agreement of the qualitative results was 100 for both assays there was minimal interference from hemolysis icterus and lipemia supplemental table 3  there was no carryover observed from a specimen with a high signal to negative specimens on the abbott assay supplemental table 4  here two commercially available serologic assays for detection of sars-cov-2 antibodies in human plasma were evaluated we found the abbott assay to have higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity than the ei assay although overlapping confidence intervals indicate this finding was statistically insignificant and more studies are necessary to confirm this observation nonetheless the ei assay was associated with more false negative results and false positive results relative to the abbott assay as adjudicated by molecular diagnosis importantly neither assay was sensitive enough to reliably detect antibodies before 14d postsymptom onset to our knowledge this is the first of such assay comparisons that adhere to validation guidelines and compare multiple commercial platforms given the relaxed regulatory requirements by the fda on sars-cov-2 serology tests it is crucial for clinical laboratories to uphold the rigor of assay validation and to determine if assay performances as reported in package inserts are accurate for example only 9 specimens from 8 patients were used to determine the diagnostic sensitivity reported in the package insert of the ei sars-cov-2 assay in contrast the clsi recommends specimens from at least 50 patients with confirmed disease 16  interestingly we also noted 3 patients who in this study we compared these two methods for calculating sensitivity we found that the sensitivity at earlier time points when benchmarked to pcr positivity was higher than when benchmarked to symptom onset however this is likely an overestimation of sensitivity as some patients presented late and were further in their disease progression at time of first pcr testing as evidence of this the median time to onset of symptoms in patients with pcr and serologic positive results on the same day of testing was 14d nonetheless adjudicating from 14d from symptom onset and 14d from pcr positive results provided similar sensitivity it is important for laboratories to define how they have determined time to positive results when calculating sensitivity and distributing this information to providers our results also demonstrate low sensitivity for detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies before 14d post-symptom onset on both assays this argues that serologic status should not be assessed until 14d post-symptom onset and confirms that molecular assays should remain the primary method for covid-19 diagnosis the low specificity on the ei assay is particularly concerning since serologic assays have been used for both population screening and epidemiologic studies 3  interestingly none of the false positive results on the ei assay were from patients with confirmed seasonal coronavirus and three of the false positives were from samples collected in 2015 this may be due at least in part to a high incidence of patients with antibodies to seasonal coronaviruses coupled with their considerable homology with sars-cov-2 12  the current number of confirmed covid-19 cases in the us is greater than 103 million resulting in an estimated prevalence of approximately 032 18 19  as a result a serologic test with high specificity is essential to achieve a high positive predictive value ppv 20  since the prevalence of sars-cov-2 antibody positive individuals in the us is currently unknown the fda summarizes predicted performance of manufacturers assays based on a 5 prevalence 21  assuming a 5 prevalence and based on the results reported here the ppv of the abbott assay is 887 and of the ei assay is 459 highlighting the importance of a high specificity however the fda also acknowledges that in low prevalence populations such as asymptomatic individuals and population screening studies a single antibody test is likely insufficient to judge true positives from false positives as evidence of this decreasing the prevalence to 05 decreases the ppv of the abbott sars-cov-2 assay to 44 and the ei to 75 the idsa recommends that patients with clinical symptoms consistent with covid-19 but negative for sars-cov-2 by molecular testing may be diagnosed by serology 5  in this study only 1 of the 80 patients who were symptomatic and pcr negative was positive by tang 13 both immunoassays while the frequency of such pcr negative-serology positive patients may increase with a larger sample size our observation also indicates that the clinical scenario proposed by idsa may be a low likelihood event this further strengthens the argument that viral rna molecular testing should remain the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19 infections larger studies are needed to fully assess the utility of serologic diagnosis as suggested by the idsa we found that time to positive serology is shorter with the abbott assay which detects an epitope of the viral nucleocapsid when compared to the ei assay which detects epitope against viral spike protein this is consistent with earlier studies of b cell responses to sars-cov where humoral immune response typically arises first against the viral nucleocapsid followed by response against the viral spike protein 22  therefore it is tempting to speculate that the viral nucleocapsid may be a better target for earlier detection of immunoglobulins however both the idsa and the cdc strongly recommend against the use of serology for diagnosing acute sars-cov-2 infection limiting the clinical relevance of this finding 5  another limitation of clinically available serologic assays is the unknown significance of the antigens targeted for detection at this time it is unclear if antibodies against the sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid or the spike protein are neutralizing and confer protection moreover since both abbott and euroimmun are qualitative assays and neither are approved for quantitative determination of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies their utility for convalescent plasma donors is yet to be defined 20  one limitation of our study is that symptom onset was subjectively reported by physicians and this information was retrieved by manual medical record review for example patients presenting from nursing home residents were poor historians due to cognitive disabilities this may have affected the estimation of disease onset in our study and the predicted kinetics of igg changes over the disease course nonetheless these kinetic results highlight the need for serial measurements in some covid patients and demonstrate that a single negative result does not necessarily rule out an infection in conclusion the abbott sars-cov-2 assay demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than ei sars-cov-2 assay in this study both assays have poor sensitivity during the first 14 days of symptom onset indicating that they are inappropriate for diagnosis as assays continue to emerge for sars-cov-2 robust validation studies must be undertaken to assess the performance of these methods values in parentheses represent 95 confidence interval

 before the wuhan citywide shutdown specimens for confirmatory tests had to be sent to china cdc with a long turnaround time subsequently several main tertiary care hospitals in wuhan were authorized to perform the tests therefore in the earlier stages of the outbreak a very limited number of patients were tested and confirmed for the diagnosis since 25 january tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients with a history of exposure fever and positive findings on chest ct however since only a limited number of tests can be offered each day due to limited supplies and lab facilities only a portion of the targeted population received tests for example during the month of january 2020 only 1700 specimens were tested media report by the hospital on wechat 1292020 compared with the vast number of clinic patients during that period between 22 january and 30 january alone there were over 7000 visits to one of the designated fever clinic this created a significant backlog as many patients had to wait for days to receive a confirmation or exclusion of diagnosis it also led to problems in realtime reporting causing artificial fluctuation in daily updates of new cases figure 2b for example as shown in table 1 using data collected from the national health commissions daily updates
7
 on some dates the change in the number of newly confirmed cases varies drastically this cannot be explained by realistic changes in the speed of infection spread needless to say the recorded figures of daily confirmed cases are likely underestimated another concern related to the nucleic acid tests is that there has not been sufficient time to assess their sensitivity and specificity based on personal communications with colleagues a significant portion of patients who otherwise fit the diagnosis based on clinical and chest ct findings including many hospitalized patients have tested negative for viral rna other common respiratory etiologies such as influenza were excluded these remain suspected cases and may be reflective of false negativity in sampling in some patients the virus may be present in the lower respiratory secretion but absent in the upper respiratory tracts with the current tests it is therefore difficult to achieve a meaningful assessment of what proportion of symptomatic patients are infected data from the sars epidemic show that serological responses including viralspecific immunoglobulin m igm and igg can allow for serologic diagnosis

 most recently it was shown that patients with 2019ncov pneumonia also possessed similar acute serological responses

 using the bat sarsr111 cov rp3 nucleocapsid protein np as an antigen both igg and igm antibodies could be detected with enzymelinked immunoassay elisa in these patients the dynamic pattern is consistent with an acute viral infection with the igg concentration beginning to rise as igm levels start to drop
4

 as we know the production of host antibodies to a specific virus during an acute phase infection is consistent in most patients except for those with immunodeficiency the igm antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections the requirement for specimen quality is less stringent than for rnabased assays whether viruses themselves are present in respiratory specimens the presence of a specific antibody can be uniformly detected avoiding falsenegative results due to sampling most importantly with the regular 96well microplate and automatic elisa devices the test capacity is greatly increased compared to rnabased molecular tests and can handle a large number of febrile patients such as in the current epidemic with a quick turnaround time 23 hours for example hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantavirus was endemic in hubei province with a high annual incidence in the 1980s and 1990s the rapid and specific etiologic diagnosis was critical for patient management and epidemic controls an igmcapture elisa was used to quickly screen all febrile patients effectively during those epidemic seasons
10
 
11
 similarly for the novel coronavirus pneumonia ncvp situation an igmcapture elisa can offer earlier and more efficient confirmation or exclusion of the ncov2019 infection in patients with fever thus adding to the accuracy of epidemiologic monitoring and facilitating proper isolation of patients from a technical point of view although the np can serve as a sensitive antigen other 2019ncovspecific epitopes or antigens should be explored for use in the serology assay it has been reported that the n protein of sars cov antigenically crossreacted with antisera of antigenic groupi animal coronaviruses such as human coronavirus 229e feline infectious peritonitis virus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc404591 therefore the use of the whole n protein as the antigen for serological assay could lead to specificity and sensitivity issues potentially during this current outbreak one of the authors volunteered in one of the designated fever clinics the scene was astonishing with over a thousand of anxious patients with illnesses ranging from mild to severe all lined up and waiting over 4 hours to be seen the vast majority could be individuals without infection by ncov2019 yet all the protection they had was facial masks one cannot imagine how much risk for cross infection can occur in such overcrowded situations if some rapid viral diagnostic tests were available the situation would be completely different patients could quickly have blood drawn when they first arrive and wait elsewhere to receive the results or they could have blood drawn in their own communities common residential areas called xiao qu in wuhan as in most other cities to avoid a trip to the clinics and high potential for ncov2019 exposure coincident with the 2019ncov outbreak is the season for several other common respiratory etiologies such as influenza and the common cold after the citywide shutdown and heightened public warning there was a surge of clinic patients many patients would visit several clinics or the same clinic daily trying to be selected for rna tests a significant number of them had symptoms or lab findings that are not consistent with ncvp such as elevated lymphocytes and lack of chest ct findings with a serological test these patients could avoid the clinic visits currently rnabased molecular tests require upscale lab facilities with restrictive biosafety levels and technical sophistication and expensive the screening patient population is in both large medical centers or smaller communitylevel hospitals serologic tests can be easily implemented in the clinical laboratory of any hospital thus with a much wider application than molecular tests another issue for consideration is reporting of asymptomatically infected cases or very mild cases of infection who are a large group of patients but not tested for viral rna which is impractical therefore making the true rate of infection in the population unknown with the development of a specific igg antibody test a largescale seroepidemiological study can be conducted after the end of the current outbreak so that we can understand the true scale of humantohuman transmission of the novel coronavirus of 2019 a fastperforming serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and future outbreaks the authors declare that there are no

suggestion that coronaviruses might playa small but definite part in the etiology of bronchiolitis and pneumonia because of the great difficulty in cultivation of coronaviruses in vitro no attempts were made in these studies to corroborate serologic data with recovery of virus indeed to our knowledge coronaviruses have not previously been isolated from young children because of this paucity of

the previous 10 days virologic methods conventional methods for recovery of virus and serodiagnosis have been described 4  these methods would detect infection by respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza viruses types 1 2 and 3 adenoviruses influenza virus types a and b and mycoplasmpneumoniae 10  in this study antibodies to three coronavirus serotypes were measured human coronavirus

kaye and dowdle 13  a multivalent cf antigen containing four serotypes of mouse hepatitis virus microbiological associates bethesda md was included in our tests because of the known antigenic relationship of mouse hepatitis virus to the human coronaviruses 14 15 and because of its demonstrated capacity to react with antibodies to coronavirus in human sera 16  we attempted recovery of coronavirus from frozen oropharyngeal swab specimens obtained from selected children during acute illness with serologic evidence of 229e infection specimens were thawed and inoculated onto roller-tube monolayers of the human embryonic intestine fibroblast cell line ma-177 microbiological associates  this line previously had exhibited unusual sensitivity in the recovery of 229e-like viruses 17  material from the first or second passage was then transferred to and further propagated in wi-38 cells unconcentrated sonicates from infected roller-tube cultures were stained with phosphotungstic acid and examined in an rca emu-4a electron microscope 503 epidemiology of corona virus infection during the study period 417 children with acute lrtd were examined for serologic evidence of coronavirus infection only 13 serum pairs from control patients were available during this period but these had an age distribution proportionally similar to that of the lrtd serum pairs about 80 of the children were under one year old more than 90 of the infants were black coronavirus infection was detected serologi-callby a fourfold or greater rise in antibody in 34 ifants 82 of all those with acute lrtd and iii one of the 13 control infants the incidence of infection in relation to age is shown in table 1 there is some evidence that the youngest group shown those under two months old were infected less often than older children the seasonal incidence of acute lrtd and of coronavirus infection is shown in figure 1  numbers of hospital admissions for patients with acute lrtd show the expected peaks during the winter months coronavirus infections tended to occur in small outbreaks but with little seasonal preference this finding is in contrast to most other studies which have shown distinct increases in coronavirus infections in the winter and early spring 8 18  two periods of increased coronavirus incidence occurred table 2  both small outbreaks involved infants who had either pneumonia 6 or bronchiolitis 1 2  during both these periods infections with coronavirus were more common than those due to oteriruses te first period followed a large epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus but during the two months of coronavirus activity only 89  of the children were infected with respiratory syncytial virus during the second period there were cases of respiratory syncytial virus influenza a and parainfluenza types 1 and 3 but none of these individual viruses was found in more than 116 of infants whereas 163 of the infants had coronavirus infections 3 coronavirus infection in pneumonia and bronchiolitis table 4 ranks in incidence higher than adenovirus parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2 influenza a and rhinovirus and lower than respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 clinical aspects of pneumonia and bronchiolitis associated with coronavirus infection of the 30 infants with coronavirus infection during bronchiolitis or pneumonia 13 were simultaneously infected with one or more other viruses however the single infections did not differ clinically from the multiple infections eighteen children required oxygen or were thought to be in respiratory distress with intercostal retractions vomiting occurred in nine infants and otitis media shared serologic activity among the human coronaviruses the rises in antibody to coronaviruses in paired sera of infants are analyzed in detail in table 5 all such rises were reproduced in replicate testing or were eightfold or greater serologic responses were shared between oc43 and mouse hepatitis virus in seven serum pairs crossreactivity between oc43 and 229e was found in five infants it is of interest that the seven infants included in the first outbreak of coronavirus described in table 2 all showed infection with 229e alone at other times the character of the rises in antibody to coronavirus was more heterogeneous recovery of coronaviruses from infants with acute lrtd frozen oropharyngeal swab specimens from nine infants with serologic evidence of infection with 229e alone were thawed and inoculated onto ma-177 monolayers seven specimens were from children involved in the outbreak in february and march 1967 despite multiple blind passages of these specimens and despite the appearance of suggestive cytopathic changes at certain passage levels consistent cpe failed to develop note infants were considered positive if virus was recovered or if there was serologic evidence of infection 231 infants with pneumonia and 149 infants with bronchiolitis were tested some infants were positive for more than one virus specimens from two infants ages one and two months hospitalized with pneumonia on august 11 and august 28 1967 yielded cytopathic agents on second blind subpassage the table 4  relative incidence of various respiratory virus infections in infants with pneumonia or bronchiolitis of the two isolates of virus strain 1428 detected rises in antibody in nine serum pairs that exhibited rises to strain 229e cf antigen and to no other viral antigens tested the two homologous serum pairs were included coronavirus infections are common in young children hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis ranking in frequency only behind respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 infection this high rate of prevalence clearly does not constitute proof that coronaviruses are causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants indeed infection might have been incidental to lrtd caused by another agent in the one previous study that examined this problem 8 infections in control children were common but the number of such children in the group aged less than 18 months was as in the present study too small to be of significance and the suitability of the control group was also in question in the absence of statistically valid data therefore other considerations are of importance two aspects of this study are unique and provide some argument for the etiologic importance of coronaviruses in lrtd in infants first two small outbreaks ie circumscribed periods of increased incidence of coronavirus infection were defined in both coronavirus infections were clearly more common than those due to other respiratory viruses in the first outbreak children infected with strain 229e showed no evidence of infection with other respiratory viruses including other serotypes of human coronavirus in the second despite activity of several common respiratory viruses coronaviruses were predominant second coronavirus strains were recovered from two children during the acute stage of pneumonia the strains were antigenically similar or identical to strain 229e and antibody responses to these strains were demonstrated in the homologous paired sera these two recoveries of coronavirus are the first reported from infants further studies to identify the role of coronaviruses in infant lrtd seem indicated at the present time their role is uncertain the present study provides data that may implicate coronaviruses in at least a portion of pneumonia and bronchiolitis of young children the pathogenicity of coronaviruses which has been demonstrated in adults beyond reasonable doubt by studies in volunteers 19  is more difficult to prove in children it is likely that as techniques for recovery and recognition of coronavirus are improved and as other coronavirus serotypes are discovered infection will be found more frequently and the etiologic role of coronaviruses in lr td of children will be better defined  an

lonneke leijten casper rokx bart rijnders janette rahamat-langendoen johannes van den akker p jeroen van kampen j annemiek van der eijk a rob van binnendijk s bart haagmans marion koopmans   the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in late 2019 to cause coronavirus disease covid-19 the rapid global spread and exponential growth of the pandemic wave have stretched the limits of the available healthcare and intensive care unit capacity since the initial notification of an outbreak on december 31st the global response has transitioned from the initial policy of active case finding and containment to an increasingly complex package of confinement measures including closures of schools implementation of travel restrictions and physical distancing measures at present given the global circulation of sars-cov-2 the consensus is that elimination of the virus is no longer feasible and that longer-term strategies are needed that strike a balance between the economically and socially damaging near lockdown approaches and full release of any control measures there is wide agreement that in the latter situation rapid resurgence would be very likely with modeled epidemic peaks potentially exceeding the current healthcare capacity1 the so-called exit strategy is defined as the transition from the current approach which focuses entirely on flattening the peak of the covid-19 emergence curve to the transition phase in which restrictions are gradually lifted the gradual lifting of control measures will require active surveillance to allow early detection of new cases or clusters coupled with contact tracing and quarantine most likely combined with continued physical distancing recommendations and enhanced protection of those at-risk from most severe disease a key knowledge gap is the level and duration of protective immunity in the population at large and in specific groups including persons with different clinical severity12 to assess the extent of virus circulation in the community and the likelihood of protection against a re-infection there is a crucial need to add serology to the testing algorithms the required performance of a serological assay will depend on the specific aim of testing which may be either population screening in the general population or at-risk populations or diagnostic support we recently showed that antibodies directed against the s1 subunit of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and specifically to the receptor binding domain rbd within the s1 subunit strongly correlate with virus neutralization3 the likelihood of predicting protective antibody responses will thus increase when using either s1 antigens or rbd in the assay the specificity of serological tools detecting antibodies against sars cov-2 might be hampered by the presence of antibodies against other circulating coronaviruses in the population and thus testing for cross reactivity is crucial when selecting an appropriate assay for a specific purpose decision making should include the available knowledge on antibody specificities kinetics and functions4 the limited knowledge on antibody kinetics in emerging virus infections is always a challenge for design and validation of serological assays during an outbreak recent studies in covid-19 patients have shown that in both hospitalized patients and patients with mild disease seroconversion rates reach 100 after 1014 days and that antibody levels may correlate with clinical severity235 this is in line with observations in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection in which antibody responses varied depending on disease severity with mild and asymptomatic infections resulting in weaker immune responses6 therefore for meaningful interpretation of serological assays and extrapolation of results to population screening sufficient samples from persons with mild and asymptomatic disease should be included in validation studies in our study we compare three platforms which are widely used in diagnostic laboratories three rapid tests four elisas and a high throughput chemiluminescent assay clia which can be used to address different needs for individualized home testing as supplement to diagnostics and in population screening we analyze their performance in correlation to an in-house virus neutralization assay3 which is currently the gold standard when assessing protective immunity against sars cov-2 serological testing to support clinical diagnostic work-up is mostly requested in hospitalized patients this can be for example when sars cov-2 rna diagnostic testing remains negative in a patient despite a strong clinical suspicion or for patients whose samples during the symptomatic phase were not collected other patients in whom antibody testing can be very valuable are those who have been hospitalized for weeks and in whom a pcr test continues to be positive with increasing cycle threshold values in these patients the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies can help with the decision to stop using personal protective equipment in these patients usually the serological results are interpreted by laboratory staff and there is a possibility to test follow-up sera or perform confirmation serological testing when comparing the laboratory assays in patients with different severity and stages of disease overall and in patients tested more than 14 days post-onset of disease the rbd antigen based wantai total ig assay performed best fig 1 table 1 both igg assays targeting the s antigen euroimmun and liaison lacked sensitivity in hospitalized patients as the sample set included early time-points the s1 based iga assay by euroimmun in contrast had a good sensitivity and showed the best quantitative relationship specifically once neutralizing titers were higher than 80 prnt50 units upon which the rbd ig assay becomes non-linear iga testing will detect both early and memory iga responses and will thus be a useful addition to igg assays the possible relevance of quantitative antibody measurements will need to be assessed when results of longer-term patient follow-up studies become available an alternative of the prnt50 can be the use of a surrogate virus neutralization test for sars cov-2 as recently produced by genscript usa which allows direct quantification extensive studies on the performance have however not yet been published despite the differences in sensitivity all laboratory assays had sufficient positive predictive value ppv in covid-19 hospitalized patients when assuming an expected seroprevalence in this population of 50 table 1 or when using serology as an adjunct to rt-pcr testing to monitor the clinical course of illness their application as sole diagnostic howeverfor instance in primary care where the seroprevalence will be much lowerwill be more challenging as illustrated by the variation in ppv of the assays with a seroprevalence estimate of 4 which is the level currently observed in the netherlands7 in addition to specialized elisa assays used in laboratory settings a wide range of rapid diagnostic tests rdt has been put on the market triggering the question whether they can be used in patient care or for triage in a medical care facility we selected three rdts by following criteria 1 preferably targetting the spike of sars-cov-2 2 at least european conformity ce marking or other authorization and 3 sufficient production capacity the rdts provide qualitative yesno results which does not allow quantification or the definition of a cut-off for neutralization fig 1fh all three rdts had a sufficient ppv in high seroprevalence scenarios which implies that there might be a role for the rdts when used for the individual patient with a sufficiently high pretest probability as an add on to pcr based diagnostics the high negative predictive value npv of the rdts in a low seroprevalence scenario could offer opportunities for the use of the test in the general population if the aim is to rule out the presence of sars cov-2 antibodies table 1 population screening during a pandemic phase requires a highly specific assay to assure an acceptable ppv in populations with a low sero-prevalence3 and additionally a reasonable sensitivity table 1 this condition was met for the wantai elisas and euroimmun igg elisa the euroimmun iga and liaison  clia analyzer performed less well with specificities 95 when testing serum samples from persons exposed to a range of viruses table 18 this led to very low ppvs of respectively 39 and 26 for the euroimmun iga and the clia analyzer in low prevalence settings while the wantai total ig continued to perform reasonably well tested specimen were obtained from patients with mild moderate and severe disease all patients had detectable antibodies by prnt50 from day 18 supplementary data the severity of disease did not affect the range of detected neutralizing titers or sensitivity of selected assays table 1 supplementary data due to limitations in sample volumes of mild patients these were not equally tested in all assays in addition future studies are recommended to address the performance of alternative high throughput assays like the roche elecsys anti-sars-cov-2 or abbott sars-cov-2 igg in correlation to neutralization for the rdts the specificities varied from 85 to 99 table 1 although  the overall performance of the cellex assay with 99 specificity was hampered by its low sensitivity of 80 generally the use of the selected rdt is not recommended in population screening where estimated seroprevalence is mostly 5 and the ppv will be too low for a reliable interpretation table 1 a final question in population screening is whether the antibody measurements correlate with functional antibodies that can protect a population during a subsequent exposure in our analyses samples testing positive in the wantai ig elisa with an od ratio  10 all had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies which suggests thatusing a cut-off- in this assay could be used to indicate presence of neutralizing antibodies the exact kinetics and functionality of these antibodies in offering protection remains to be determined in conclusion our presented data support decision making for the use of serology in either individual patient care or population-level serological testing we conclude that for the aim of detecting protective antibodies the rbd based wantai elisa had the best overall performance including the potential to set a cut-off indicating the presence of protective antibodies the global performance of the selected rdts is not robust enough for over the counter personalized testing in the population all specimen used in the study have been collected and delivered to our diagnostic laboratory for patient diagnostics and not following a predefined covid-19 research protocol to determine specificity of the assays we used a well-defined panel of 147 serum and plasma samples from 147 individuals exposed to human coronaviruses hcov-229e nl63 or oc43 sars mers or with a range of other respiratory viruses adenovirus human metapneumovirus influenza ab rsv ab rhinovirus bocavirus parainfluenzavirus 1 and 3 enterovirus specimen from patients with recent cytomegalovirus cmv epstein barr virus ebv or m pneumoniae infection were included as these have a high likelihood of causing cross reactivity sera were collected from 23 weeks upon the respiratory infection and during the acute phase of cmv or ebv the variation in the number of samples tested per assay was caused by limited sample volume and by the limited  availability of rdts during the study period sensitivity was calculated by using a total of 187 sera from 107 individuals in the netherlands in whom covid-19 was confirmed by rt-pcr and antibodies were detected by prnt50 disease severity varied from 1 mild non-hospitalized 2 moderate hospitalized and 3 severe admitted to the intensive care unit specimen were taken at different time-points post-onset of disease supplementary data fig 1 all specimen were stored at 20 c until use the variation in the number of samples tested per assay is caused by the fact that validation was part of the acute diagnostic response during the first phase of the covid-19 pandemic initially a set of 75 patient sera was tested in all assays these sera were mostly collected from hospitalized patients and involved only three sera from mild patients to assess the performance of the assays in population screening it is important to involve sera from mild patients so we increased the number of tested sera in the wantai elisas liaison and rdts the selection of these assays was based on the best overall performance of wantai elisas in the first analyses and the likely application of liaison and rdts in population screening the exact number of specimen tested per assay varied due to availability of serum figure 1 depicts the outcome of the assays per time interval analyses in mild patients are shown in table 1 source data can be found in the supplementary data 1 the use of specimen was approved by the erasmus mc medical ethical committee mec approval 2014414 which allows the use of clinical data and left-over material from the specimen delivered to our laboratory for diagnostics unless patients have declared they opted out of this scheme in addition the erasmus mc institutional research committee regulated that all covid-19 patients admitted to erasmus mc are asked for permission to use their clinical data and left-over patient material for covid-19 research purposes all patients who refused have been excluded from the analyses four selected

information on research design is available in the nature research reporting summary linked to this article  serologic testing of coronaviruses from mers-cov to sars-cov-2 learning from the past and anticipating the future jaffar al-tawfiq a ziad memish a   the recent development of the coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 had caused a global pandemic with significant impact on healthcare system similar to the acute infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the infection with the sars-cov-2 causative agent of covid-19 is associated with asymptomatic infection 1 testing for mers-cov and sars-cov-2 is currently dependent on molecular testing rt-pcr there were multiple generation of molecular tests that were developed over the proceeding few months in an effort to improve the sensitivity and specificity however there is a global shortage of molecular tests for sars-cov-2 with expanding scope of testing in many countries to identify cases for the isolation and application of quarantine measures for serologic diagnosis of mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections the identifications of antibodies require both acute and convalescent serum sampling this is particularly important as we witness an increased number of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic covid-19 infections it is understandable that such serologic tests are not performed routinely to diagnose respiratory viral infections however it is not known if asymptomatic individuals are able to mount an antibody response serologic testing enables us to understand the extent of the tip of the iceberg death rate as we detect more asymptomatic individuals serologic testing enables policy makers to make informed scientific decisions regarding the resumption of usual life and lifting social distancing and lockdown of cities especially if we have the 5060 seroprevalence which is taken as a signal of herd immunity serologic tests will enable the healthcare community to understand the extent of the infection as well as be an important tool to identify those who are already immune such as healthcare workers identification of immune hcws would allow those to go back to work in addition serology would be particularly important to assess the effectiveness of any vaccines the development of serologic tests requires better understanding of the sars-cov-2 structure and the immunologic response to the virus the most appealing site for such antibodies is the spike s protein of the sars-cov-2 however there are multiple parts of the s-protein and it is not clear which part of this protein offers the best site for antibody development 2 it is also important to make sure that these antibody tests are unique and do not cross react with the widely distributed common cold coronaviruses or mers-cov in areas of its endemicity one study of three patients showed cross-reactivity with the sars-cov s and s1 proteins and to a lower extent with mers-cov s protein but not with the mers-cov s1 protein 3 an excellent serologic test would be 100 sensitive and 100 specific especially for measuring sars-cov-2 s and rdb iga igg and igm antibodies having a helpful serology requires that we know that such antibodies are specific confirm a long immunity and know how these antibodies protect against infection to avoid the false sense of security in relation to infection an additional area of concern is the need to have a diagnostic stewardship as these tests will not be helpful in the diagnosis of acute covid-19 infection an early study of sars-cov-2 patients showed the presence of igm antibodies in 50 816 and in 81 1316 and that igg antibodies were detected in 81 1316 and 100 1616 of patients over time 4 and igm was detected in other studied patients 5 the seroconversion was said to occur in 2 weeks in one study 3 the s1 igg and iga elisas had lower specificity with variable sensitivity and that iga elisa had higher sensitivity 3 in a study of contacts of a patient with mild symptoms evaluation of igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence assays ifa based on vero e6 cells in the index patient igg and igm were undetectable on day 4 after onset of symptoms however igg titers were 80 and 1280 and those of igm were 80 and 320 on days 9 and 20 respectively 6 none of the 19 healthcare contacts were positive 6 in the case of sars-cov the detection of antibodies was possible on days 342 for igm and on days 547 for igg 7 there are few studies addressing serology to different sars-cov-2 antigens one study of three patients antibodies were detected against s1 subunit and rbd and only two patients had detectable antibodies to the n-terminal s1a domain 3 serologic testing may also facilitate the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection in families one study showed a family cluster of covid-19 among 5 of 6 members by serology vs 2 members based on pcr testing 8 looking back at the lessons we learned from the mers-cov serology we could deduce few similarities and differences with sars-cov-2 in family contacts of mers-cov cases serologic analysis showed that of 280 contacts 19 67 had positive recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay relisa s1 6 21 had positive recombinant immunofluorescence assay rrifa full s and only 4 14 had positive plaque-reduction neutralization testing prn 8 however a follow up samples 26 months later showed serologic positivity among 44 samples of 5 114 2 45 and 1 23 using relisa rrifa and prn respectively 9 this study showed the following subclinical transmission in the families a minority of contacts had positive serology and a fraction had persistent antibodies months after infection currently we do not have studies of sars-cov-2 serology extending overtime to document the persistence of these antibodies an area where serology would be beneficial is surveillance and this is an awaited step to understand the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 infection however for mers-cov there was a nation-wide serosurviellance study in saudi arabia that study examined the serologic response in 10009 individuals and showed that anti-mers-cov antibodies were confirmed in 15 015 95 ci 009024 10 there is a large variation in the diagnostic capabilities of different serologic assays in different laboratories and it was recommended that laboratories use a testing algorithm including 2 tests to ensure correct diagnosis of mers-cov 11 in addition mers-cov s1 protein-based elisa was used for surveillance studies and was found to have a low sensitivity in detecting infection in pcr-confirmed patients with mild clinical symptoms 12 although patients with mild mers-cov infection as detected by pcr tests had seroconversion not all of them had detectable levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies 12 this may indicates that the presence of anti-mers-cov antibodies might not indicate immunity thus currently the evidence for the use of serologic testing of sars-cov-2 is not optimal these tests are subject to variability in sensitivity and specificity differences in the timing of the appearance of antibodies and whether these antibodies confirm protection is not known this is particularly important when making decisions about hcws who might be at risk of contracting sars-cov-2  sars-cov-2 antibody characterization in emergency department hospitalized and convalescent patients by two

mortality among susceptible individuals with comorbidities acute symptoms and signs of sars-cov-2 infection are highly nonspecific and include fever cough fatigue myalgia and dyspnea with some patients progressing to pneumonia 2 3 4 however some other individuals are asymptomatic carriers 5 6 7 these characteristics of the disease create an urgent need to develop serological tests to identify asymptomatic silent infections evaluate patient immune response better predict disease progression and improve our understanding of the epidemiology including transmission patterns of

covid-19 negative and positive populations as well as a lack of thorough comparison between different serological testing platforms such data are urgently needed to evaluate the clinical utility and

1antibody testing in patients during their ed visit
 cefa and mia had detection rates of 262 95ci 153-411 and 263 95ci 150-42 respectively p005 when patients first presented to the ed and tested covid-19 positive by rt-pcr number of days since any symptom onset mean65 95ci 518-7732longitudinal change of igm and igg in the hospitalized patients
 we investigated 42 ed patients 120 samples by cefa and 114 samples by mia in which 28 patients 106 samples by cefa and 100 samples by mia were subsequently admitted the detection rates of igm igg or both at different times after symptom onset are shown in table 3
 only 25 cefa 95 ci 44-591 and 143 mia 95 ci 07-513 of the samples in early phase 0-3 days after symptom onset were antibody positive however the detection rate increased to 690 cefa 95 ci538-809 and 650 mia 95 ci 495-779 during days 8-14 933 95 ci702-997 during days 15-20 and finally reached 100 cefa 95 ci 845-1000 mia 95 ci 832-1000 in samples that were obtained more than 21 days after symptom onset the sensitivities of the two methods were not significantly different during any time frame the plot of index values log10 scale and a simulated trending curve of igmigg and total antibody are shown in figures 2
a and b respectively overall igm cefa figure 2a reached peak levels between days 10 and 20 after symptom onset and declined afterwards igg cefa figure 2a and total antibody mia figure 2b reached a peak in a similar time frame as igm but then plateaued the comparison of the slope utilizing the gee method revealed the rate of change of igm iv log10 scale is significantly slower than that of igg p  00001 figure 2c the changing rate of total antibody is shown in figure 2d longitudinal changes of normalized index value log10 scale measured by the cefa assay igg and igm and the mia method total antibodies were plotted in the 28 inpatients including 18 patients on ventilators figure 3
a and 10 patients not on ventilators figure 3b overall the changing trend of antibody levels correlated well between the cefa and mia measurements all patients on ventilators and 5 patients not on ventilators had a significant increase in antibody levels during their disease course among them the igg and total antibody levels in 10 patients reached to a plateau around day 15-20 post-symptom onset igm levels in 5 patients started declining 16  21 days post-symptom onset three types of seroconversion were observed synchronous seroconversion of igg and igm 17 patients igm seroconversion earlier than that of igg 1 patient and igg seroconversion earlier than that of igm 5 patients five patients discharged less than 14 days after admission did not have detectable antibody levels thus it is unclear if these patients had sufficient time to develop an antibody response further analysis suggests that changes in igm igg and total antibody levels over time are not significantly different between the ventilator and non-ventilator groups in our dataset p  030 for igm p  084 for igg p  01 for total antibody a total of 144 samples from convalescent patients who tested positive by sars-cov-2 rt-pcr or had covid-19 exposure or symptoms were tested by both cefa and mia methods which showed large variations of antibody levels in convalescent sera the distribution of igg index values and total antibody index values among 75 positive samples by both methods are shown in figure 4
a and b respectively this study serves as an important example of a collaborative effort between an academic clinical laboratory and state government agency this study sheds light on the performance and potential clinical utility of two sars-cov-2 antibody testing methodologies during the covid-19 outbreak in new york city overall both cefa and mia assays demonstrated excellent analytical performance in their independent validations as well as concordance in ed inpatient and convalescent samples while the result reporting differs between the two assays where one detects igm and igg separately and the other targets total antibody we found that the detection rate at any given time period post-symptom onset did not differ significantly with both assays demonstrating sensitivities  25 when tested 7 days after symptoms began reaching 100  21 days after symptom onset these results are consistent with previous studies 17 evaluating recombinant immunofluorescence or chemiluminescent immunoassays 18 19 in contrast rt-pcr testing demonstrates its highest level of sensitivity during the first week of symptoms and then gradually declines in the next few weeks 20 21 we demonstrate that serological testing has limited diagnostic value in screening symptomatic patients during their first ed visit as reporting of symptom onset in ed patients is subject to recall bias a variation in time to antibody detection was observed with most rt-pcr sars-cov-2 positive patients demonstrating detectable antibody levels 3 -7 days post hospital admission therefore if there is high clinical suspicion of covid-19 in patients negative by rt-pcr repeated or serial monitoring of serum antibodies may be helpful in confirming disease status and prudent to achieve optimal sensitivity in combination with rt-pcr both methods demonstrated high specificity which is critical for evaluating hospitalized patients and understanding of the epidemiology neither cefa nor mia showed the cross-reactivity in the samples from other coronavirus infected patients the limitation was the relatively small sample size due to the limited access and future larger studies are warranted to further examine the assay cross-reactivity in addition while the cefa and mia assays exhibited overall excellent agreement with kappa 081 a small proportion of samples disagreed a possible explanation for the disagreement was the difference in the underlying principle of the assays the antigens for the cefa method is the s protein rbd and np targeting igm and igg in separate assays the antigen for the mia method is the np targeting total antibodies currently it is unknown which assay is more correlated with protected role of antibody which warrant future studies the kinetic change of antibody levels was consistent between the two methodologies all mechanically ventilated patients displayed an increase in igm and igg levels during the course of their hospitalization three types of seroconversion were observed interesting 74 patients in our study showed synchronous seroconversion 5 showed igg prior to igm whereas only 1 out of 23 patients had igm seroconversion earlier than igg these patterns of seroconversion are similar to a previous report showing that the majority of patients 731 had either synchronous seroconversion or igg seroconversion earlier than igm 22 however due to the nature of this study serum specimens of most patients could not be collected on a daily basis at the later stages of illness or post-recovery therefore a complete dynamic pattern of antibody levels could not be studied and thus the full time course of the antibody response remains unknown in these patients a more thorough investigation is needed to monitor the kinetic change of antibody levels over an extended period of time including convalescence prior studies reported most individuals infected with sars-cov-1 mounted an antibody response 23 24 25 whereas mers-cov infected patients with mild or asymptomatic infections exhibited varied immune responses which at times were undetectable by antibody assays 26 27 while there is growing data on the antibody response to sars-cov-2 infection 18 28 29 the level and duration of the anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic covid-19 patients is still uncertain in the present dataset all 18 patients in the mechanically ventilated group seroconverted this is in contrast to 5 cefa and 4 mia out of 10 patients in the non-ventilated group who had undetectable igm and igg levels during their hospital stay four patients were discharged  10 days post-symptom onset and 1 patient had undetectable antibodies when discharged on day 13 after symptom onset thus this retrospective study cannot provide additional data on these patients however the perceived suboptimal antibody responses is likely due to short hospitalizations resulting in the lack of specimen for analysis during the intermediate and late stages of the disease more specimens from mildly ill patients will need to be collected for longer time periods in order to better understand patterns of sars-cov-2 immune response this information is essential to discussions regarding reentry into the workforce by asymptomatic individuals post-infection it has been suggested that worse outcomes and increased disease severity with covid-19 may correspond with increased sars-cov-2 igg levels or a higher titer of sars-cov-2 antibodies when compared to those with less severe disease 20 30 31 although the current study found that the positivity rate of antibodies increased with time after symptom onset for both methods there was no statistical difference in antibody levels based on ventilation status assay variation may explain the lack of correlation between antibody levels and severity of disease as our methods currently are validated only for qualitative sars-cov-2 antibody analysis and its semi-quantitative use may not give the analytical resolution needed for such studies bias may also exist in that patients with milder symptoms did not present to the hospital and thus there is no comparison between this missing cohort and the cohort of hospitalized patients which displayed more severe symptoms functional assays such as neutralizing antibody assays have been proposed to evaluate the efficacy of vaccinations and due to the complicated interplay between virus and the immunologic host response 32 neutralizing antibody assays 30 may be better suited for such correlation studies furthermore this study did not extensively follow longitudinally patient antibody levels and consequently the study was likely underpowered in its ability to see this secondary outcome measure additional independent large-cohort studies would be needed to further study these previously described findings both the fda and cdc stress the importance of serological testing for the detection of prior infection in asymptomatic individuals and those presenting late in illness as well as identifying individuals who have mounted an immune response to sars-cov-2 33 34 our data suggest that there is a wide range of antibody levels in convalescent serum of note the distribution of antibody positivity in convalescent sera examined in this study cannot be used to determine antibody prevalence and levels in the general population as these were random samples from patients recovered from covid-19 and covid-19-like illnesses cases have been reported that convalescent plasma therapy improved the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viremia in severe covid-19 cases 10 35 further studies are needed to investigate whether igg or total antibody levels correlate with neutralizing antibody levels thereby identifying potential therapeutic serum donors in summary we performed a thorough analytical validation and clinical evaluation of two semi-quantitative sars-cov-2 immunoassays our results demonstrated the clinical utilities of serological testing in evaluating inpatients and convalescent patients the sensitivity of the current immunoassays are not suitable for early-stage screening future studies are needed to investigate the immune response in asymptomatic and mildly ill patient population and to understand the correlation between total antibody and neutralizing antibody levels

submission  prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection in health workers hws and diagnostic test performance the experience of a teaching hospital in central italy edith lahner emanuele dilaghi claudio prestigiacomo giuliano alessio laura marcellini maurizio simmaco iolanda santino giovanni orsi battista paolo anibaldi adriano marcolongo bruno annibale christian napoli   since december 2019 the entire world is still fighting against an infection caused by a novel coronavirus designated as sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the epidemic started in china and has spread rapidly worldwide becoming a pandemic 1  before the 2009 influenza ah1n1 pandemic most european union eu member states including italy had already developed preparedness plans including planning assumptions on what can be expected during a pandemic and on how a pandemic virus might behave 2 also considering the infective risk related to the global movements of the population 3 nevertheless since the first outbreak of sars-cov-2 disease covid-19 at the end of february 2020 in northern italy the epidemic gradually spread across the country 4 as of 15 may 2020 italy has had 223096 confirmed cases and 31368 deaths 1 from a clinical point of view the covid-19 syndrome is characterized by fever dry cough shortness of breath and in severe cases by acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis septic shock and finally multi-organ failure 5 sars-cov-2 is highly contagious and its main route of human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact or air droplets with a higher risk of transmission within one meter from the infected person 6 furthermore a possible fecaloral transmission has been described and feces of sars-cov-2-positive patients are potentially infectious 7 health workers hws directly or indirectly exposed to actually or potentially positive sars-cov-2 patients may be themselves at an increased risk 8 data regarding the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infections in hws are scarce and characterized by underlying limits 9 the proportion of infected persons is estimated to range between 41 and 389 and 51 and 57 among the hws population and the general population respectively 91011 in any case the overall estimated covid-19 incidence using epidemiologic data for denominators was higher in hws than the general population 9  working in high-risk versus general heath departments suboptimal handwashing before or after patient contact longer work hours and improper protective personal equipment ppe use were reported as risk factors for acquiring the disease 9 from a clinical point of view in general hws appear to experience less severe illness and present lower mortality rates than non-hws also related to younger age and fewer comorbid conditions 9 however these data are not confirmed in italy where an elevated number of fatalities among healthcare personnel was reported 12 therefore many health institutions undertook steps to establish infection prevention measures for creating a safe environment to protect both patients and hws from sars-cov-2 infection moreover international health authorities recommended screening strategies for sars-cov-2 infection in exposed or high-risk hws 131415 further during a pandemic protecting the health of hws is of paramount importance for reducing morbidity and mortality reducing transmission and maintaining the health system capacity 16  as stated by the italian ministry for health following who recommendations the rna rt-pcr assay on mucus obtained by nasopharyngeal swabs is considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection 17 indeed the broad use of serology assays for diagnostic purposes is still controversial due to suboptimal diagnostic performance while these assays may be important for epidemiological purposes 1314161819 therefore to date the bestoptimal method to screen hws for sars-cov-2 infection seems still under debate and data on the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection in hws working in public hospitals are still scarce  in light of this scientific background the present study aims to assess i the sars-cov-2 infection rate amongst hws in a teaching hospital in central italy and ii the diagnostic performance of sars-cov-2 serology index test in comparison with the sars-cov-2 rna pcr assay reference standard  a cross-sectional study was performed in a teaching hospital in rome central italy a secondary referral center with approximately 450 beds and 1300000 services provided per year including those for both inpatients and outpatients overall the hospital accounts for 2057 hws distributed in different working categories during the pandemic the hospital was indicated as a covid-19 regional hub  the study was based on retrospective data 18 march27 april 2020 of hws physicians nurses other hospital staff upon the decision of the general and health management of the hospital all components of the hospital staff were consecutively tested for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr on nasopharyngeal swabs irrespective of exposure andor symptoms at suspicion of covid-19 before the nasopharyngeal swabs the hws filled in a questionnaire containing demographical data profession working unit and exposure to sars-cov-2 infection from 7 april 2020 the whole staff were also invited to be tested for the presence of igmigg antibodies against sars-cov-2 using serology assays on venous blood samples on a voluntary basis and a substantial subset 502 adhered to this initiative  hws were considered positive to sars-cov-2 infection when they tested positive to the rt-pcr reference standard sars-cov-2-positive and -negative hws were compared for clinical data and exposure to sars-cov-2 infection in the subset of hws tested by both rt-pcr and serology results of the igm and igg serology assays were compared to rt-pcr index test to assess the diagnostic performance of the serology tests this paper was drafted according to strobe and stard guidelines to ensure the quality of reporting 2021 sars-cov-2 rt-pcr was performed on mucus obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs by a commercial kit according to

latium a low-incidence region located in central italy the latium region has 5890401 inhabitants 22 and by 24 april 2020 a total of 4492 sars-cov-2-positive cases was registered 23 corresponding to 23 of all positive cases in italy based on these data an overall estimate of sars-cov-2 infection prevalence of 008 in the general latium population can be calculated 2223 the 23 prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection amongst the hws in our teaching hospital would thus correspond to a 34 times higher occurrence of positivity 27 this prevalence amongst hws reflects the expected higher job-related-risk of infection 8 further due to the viruss characteristics of contagiousness and route of transmission hws providing for medical and sanitary care of sars-cov-2-infected patients are directly or indirectly exposed to infection and are themselves at higher risk of being infected notwithstanding accurate hygiene and personal protective devices 16 nevertheless compared with a national rate of 107 of sars-infected hws 12 in our teaching hospital identified as one of the covid reference facilities in the latium region the rate of infected hws was more than three times lower thus suggesting an effective and timely strategy to limit the spread of sars-cov infection indeed according to the guidelines provided by the national institute of health 24 in our hospital prevention protocols were timely implemented strict hygiene rule for hand washing before and after all patients interactions contact with potentially infectious sources and before putting on and after removal of personal protective equipment wearing of personal protective equipment for all hws typically composed by surgical face mask and white cotton gown or white or green dresses hairnet goggles gloves surgical mask and disposable gown in the case of low-risk patients and hairnet googles or face-shield ffp2-3 mask water-resistant gown with long sleeves and two pairs of gloves second one covering the wrist of gown sleeves in the case of high-risk or nasopharyngeal swabs positive patients measurement of body temperature at the hospital entry subjects with body temperature over 375 c were not allowed to enter in the building different ways for clean and dirty material separate doors for entry and exit accurate patients hand hygiene etc these data are further confirmed by the fact that only 29 50 of the 58 sars-cov-2-infected hws declared to have had an exposition to infected patients inside the hospital thus probably further reducing the rate of hospital-related infections the effectiveness of prevention measures in reducing the spread of infection to hws has been demonstrated in other studies that reported a zero rate of hws being infected also after performing high-risk procedures 25 in the vast majority sars-cov-2-positive hws had a mild course of infection 67 the remaining percentage showed no symptoms at all in any case none had a fatal outcome or severe pneumonia in the non-symptomatic hws sars-cov-2 infection was diagnosed only thanks to the proactive screening strategy performed in all hws this infection prevention strategy might have further contributed to limit the spread of infection amongst hws but also amongst patients leading to a timely diagnosis and subsequent safety measures in these hws unaware of being infected paucisymptomatic or symptomless carriers of infection play a crucial role in spreading the infection further in the uk a screening program on asymptomatic hws in a teaching hospital swabbed and tested by rt-pcr was carried out and 3 tested positive for sars-cov-2 infection 26 thus keeping in step with our results on the other hand a study on sars-cov-2 testing in hws found a symptoms-related performance of diagnosis by rt-pcr 27 therefore great attention must be paid to which symptoms should be taken into account for building the screening decisional algorithm taken together these data suggest that proactive molecular screening strategies including asymptomatic as well as symptomatic hws should be a priority at the national and international levels  the all-testing strategy in our healthcare facility likely had another indirect positive implication on hws concerning psychological distress during the pandemic 28 which is increasing and at risk of leading to hw burnout 29 further if not specifically assessed in this study getting tested and thus obtaining certainty about the proper infection status might contribute to reducing the psychological burden and fear of being infected of hws during the pandemic in our study the sars-cov-2-positive hws were younger than the negatives with half of them being younger than 40 years of age this result is not consistent with other studies that found no association between age and sars-cov-1 9 while concerning sars-cov-2 a very recent chinese study reported a 19 higher occurrence of sars-cov-positivity in hws younger than 45 years of age compared with over 45 years thus supporting our finding 30 our results might be explained by less work experience due to the younger age as also supported by the shorter duration of employment of positive compared with negative hws  concerning sars-cov serology the overall igg seroprevalence was low 07 when compared with the infection rate detected by the molecular rt-pcr assay 27 a german study performed in a tertiary referral hospital described in hws stratified for confirmed suspected or no infection exposure a seroprevalence of 16 but the staff were not systematically tested by rt-pcr 31 moreover our study further showed that the diagnostic performance of sars-cov-igg serology is time-dependent sensibly increasing when performed after at least two weeks from an rt-pcr documented positivity sensitivity increased from 50 when calculated irrespective of the time interval between rt-pcr and serology to 80 after 14 days and to 100 after 20 days of rt-prc these data seem consistent with the results obtained in another study performed with a chemiluminescent assay different from that used in our study it showed an 887 sensitivity at 7 days and a 100 sensitivity at 14 and 17 days after pcr positivity with specificity values of 99 32  one further study using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay mclia for virus-specific antibody detection showed that within 19 days after the onset of symptoms 100 of patients tested positive for igg anti-sars-cov-2 supporting our results however in this study seroconversion for igg and igm occurred almost simultaneously and approximately 2022 days after symptom onset 94 of patients showed positivity to virus-specific igm antibodies 33 on the contrary in our experience the diagnostic performance of igm serology was lower than igg showing 0 of sensitivity at 99 specificity as none of the rt-pcr-positive subjects showed an igm seroconversion these data taken together confirm the likely ideal window of two weeks for the broad seroconversion and clear detectability of anti-sars-cov-2 igg antibodies while factors influencing the seroconversion of igm antibodies are less clear with igm detectability being also assay-dependent 19  therefore igm serology does not always appear useful for diagnostic purposes of active sars-cov-2 infection while igg serology has been suggested to be used for three purposes in the sars-cov-2 pandemic 1 to diagnose infection in a limited niche of patients 2 to identify convalescent plasma donors and 3 to screen populations with the purpose to determine exposure and immunity 34 however after much clamor generated around serologic assays there is still a need for data to support their clinical utility to avoid to misdiagnose and misinform 34  finally it should be noted that the available serologic assays are very different in their format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays chemiluminescent immunoassays lateral flow immunoassays virus neutralization assays in the detected antibody class iga igm igg or pools in the used sars-cov-2 antigens for example the recombinant nucleocapsid protein the subunit 1 of the spike glycoprotein or the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain and in the specimen on which the assay is performed plasma serum whole blood finger stick 35363738 high-quality serological assays are now becoming available which need to be strategically applied deployed and validated to implement their use for diagnostic therapeutical and epidemiological purposes we are aware of some limits of the study this was a single-center study conducted in central italy probably not able to reflect the spread of infection in hws throughout the whole country to minimize the effects of this limit for the comparison of the infection rate of hws with the general population only the estimated data of the latium region in the middle of april were taken into consideration moreover due to organizational reasons the nasopharyngeal swabs for sars-cov-2 infection were performed over a time frame of 40 days therefore we are not able to exclude that hws who tested negative at the beginning of the study might have become positive over time however during this period the other prevention measures such as body temperature measurement would probably have allowed ascertaining these cases however we did not analyze the extent to which the control measures were accomplished further only half of the hws joined the serology screening for the detection of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies thus reducing the sample number for the statistical computations our experience in central italy demonstrated a low prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection amongst hws but higher than in the general population nearly half of the positive hws reported no previous exposure to sars-cov-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy put in place igg serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing sars-cov-2-positive at the rna rt-pcr assay by a nasopharyngeal swab igm serology seems not to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active sars-cov-2 infection high awareness of sars-cov-2 infection is mandatory for all people but especially for hws irrespective of symptoms to safeguard their health and that of patients   identification of rt-pcr-negative asymptomatic covid-19 patients via serological testing jinru wu xinyi liu dan zhou guangqian qiu miao dai qingting yang zhonghui pan ning zhou pa wu   the coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread globally mainly via person-to-person transmission and poses a major public health concern 1 the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of symptomatic covid-19 patients have been increasingly reported in recent research 2 whereas the asymptomatic proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2-infected individuals remains largely uncharacterized symptomatic patients are detected because they seek medical attention but asymptomatic individuals with sars-cov-2 infection are identified via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 3 a previous study investigated a familial cluster of covid-19 cases that included an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy who had radiological ground-glass lung opacities and tested positive on the rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 1 a case report identified a 61-year-old asymptomatic patient with abnormal ct images and positive rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 that persisted for 23 days in the absence of obvious clinical symptoms 4 while some asymptomatic infected individuals remain asymptomatic over a long period a proportion of asymptomatic covid-19 patients were identified at the presymptomatic stage through epidemiological investigation a study identified 24 sars-cov-2 positive cases on rt-pcr comprising five cases that subsequently developed covid-19 symptoms and 19 that remained asymptomatic 5 in addition a study screened pregnant women who presented at hospitals and identified 43 covid-19 patients via nucleic acid tests including four patients who remained afebrile and asymptomatic throughout their delivery hospitalization and postpartum course 6 the abovementioned studies identified asymptomatic covid-19 patients via rt-pcr tests but the viral shedding pattern and epidemiologic characteristics of covid-19 remain poorly understood asymptomatic patients can easily be overlooked in epidemic prevention 7 8 based on data extracted from chinas infectious disease information system 889 asymptomatic cases were identified among the 72314 patient records which accounted for only 12 of the total patients 9 recent rt-pcr tests in china that primarily provided for passengers arriving from abroad revealed that 78 of the cases of new infection were asymptomatic when the tests were conducted 10 the proportion of asymptomatic covid-19 patients on the diamond princess cruise ship was estimated to be 505 and the proportion among the evacuated japanese citizens was estimated to be 308 3 11 in addition a study suggested that at least 59 of the infected cases went undetected in wuhan which potentially includes asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases 8 12 in this study we enrolled 38 patients with close contact with covid-19 who exhibited persistently negative rt-pcr results for sars-cov-2 and aimed to evaluate their antibody for sars-cov-2 via serological tests to the best of our knowledge this report is among the first reports on tracing of the index patients via serology testing among the 38 study participants enrolled in this study the median age of the patients was 475 years interquartile range 2655925 and 11 289 were female of the 38 close contacts who were tested nine cases were found positive for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody the positive serologic test results were reported with consistent results from wondfo and bioscience biotechnology co ltd both of which have been approved by the chinese national drug administration colloidal gold immunochromatography reagent from wondfo biotechnology co ltd and chemiluminescence reagent for immunoglobulin g from bioscience biotechnology co ltd were used to detect sars-cov-2 specific antibodies according to the manufacturers instructions of the nine asymptomatic cases two cases were presumed to be index patients of local cases figure 1 three cases were local patients who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients were found positive on sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testing figure 2 and four cases were close contacts of covid-19 patients and had undefined roles in disease transmission figure 3 case 1 was a 39-year-old woman who lived in wuhan and drove to loudi on january 22 2020 to visit a relative who developed fever and cough on february 9 2020 and tested positive on rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 on february 12 2020 figure 1 case 1 showed negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 on nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on february 12 17 and 24 and exhibited no fever cough dyspnea headache fatigue gastrointestinal or other covid-19 symptoms and she did not receive any therapeutic intervention over this period a blood sample collected on february 28 2020 showed that she tested positive on a serological test for sars-cov-2 figure 1 case 1 was presumed to have viral shedding during january 22 and january 25 2020 she spontaneously recovered before february 12 2020 and had no covid-19-related symptoms during the following 2 months case 2 a 52-year-old man lived in wuhan and took the train to loudi on january 15 2020 four close contacts of case 2 were later diagnosed with covid-19 figure 1 specifically one close contact had never been in contact with the other three close contacts case 2 presented with occasional cough but denied any fever dyspnea headache fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms over the period as case 2 had an occasional cough and four of his close contacts were confirmed to have covid-19 case 2 underwent medical examination from february 3 to 5 chest computed tomography ct scanning images recorded on february 4 and 7 showed exudative lesions in both lungs however the rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2 that were repeated four times with nasopharyngeal swab samples were all negative figure 1 whereas the anti-mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibody tests on february 7 were positive during the 2-week home quarantine without specific therapeutic intervention case 2 reported that his cough had resolved no characteristic symptom of covid-19 was reported thereafter however a blood sample collected on february 28 2020 tested positive for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody figure 1 although case 2 had no covid-19-related symptoms or complications during the following 2 months cases 35 were local residents without travel histories in the past 3 months and were infected by the presumed index patients from the previous epidemiologic investigation these patients presumably recovered spontaneously before their index patients were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 figure 2 cases 69 had been to wuhan or had traveled since the covid-19 outbreak and they thus had an undefined role in disease transmission figure 3 cases 39 had persistently negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 without covid-19 symptoms but tested positive on serological tests for sars-cov-2 the cases denied previous exposure to sars-cov-2 and received no therapeutic intervention or complained of covid-19-related symptoms or complications during the following 2 months nine additional asymptomatic patients of covid-19 were identified via serological tests in 38 close contacts of covid-19 patients who had persistently negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 local covid-19 cases are rare in loudi district which has a total of 76 symptomatic patients and 26 asymptomatic patients who were identified via rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 underestimation of asymptomatic infections of covid-19 has been suggested as an increasing number of infected people have not traveled to epidemic hotspots or been linked to known covid-19 patients 8 applying serological tests singapore identified the source of a cluster of 23 covid-19 patients who tested negative on rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 13 in this study we report nine asymptomatic patients identified via serological test in addition to 26 asymptomatic patients who were previously identified by the rt-pcr test the nine asymptomatic patients had multiple negative rt-pcr test results with the first rt-pcr test of these asymptomatic patients conducted almost immediately after their close contacts were identified as covid-19 patients thus a proportion of asymptomatic patients might have short viral shedding duration or may have viral nucleic acid loads that are undetectable on rt-pcr according to a previous study the interval from the first day of positive rt-pcr tests to the first day of continuous negative tests for the asymptomatic patient ranged from 1 to 21 days with five asymptomatic patients having persistently negative rt-pcr test results 1 day after the date of diagnosis 5 the results indicated the potential for the underestimation of the proportion of asymptomatic patients based on rt-pcr tests which possibly identifies only those with longer viral shedding period these results suggested that serological tests could serve as a more reliable method to estimate the asymptomatic proportion of covid-19 patients studies have suggested that symptomatic patients of covid-19 have higher transmissibility within 5 days of symptom onset than later on and infectivity might peak on or before symptom onset 14 15 however the epidemiologic characteristics of asymptomatic patients remain unclear a previous study has identified covid-19 transmission caused by an asymptomatic carrier who had normal chest ct findings 16 in addition the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients suggesting a similar transmission potential 17 herein we identified covid-19 transmission caused by two asymptomatic index patients who cleared the virus whereas their local relatives developed symptoms of covid-19 serological test results of the 9 asymptomatic patients who had repeated negative rt-pcr test results for sars-cov-2 suggest that a proportion of the individuals infected with sars-cov-2 can recover without treatment indicating that some individuals may have highly efficient neutralizing antibodies admittedly this research was limited to a small cohort with nasopharyngeal swab samples of the asymptomatic cases collected after their close contacts were confirmed to be sars-cov-2 positive on rt-pcr further studies with a large cohort are needed to elucidate the viral shedding pattern and transmission characteristics of asymptomatic cases with sars-cov-2 infection this study was approved by the hunan normal university institutional review board written informed consent was obtained from the participants for the publication of the case

maria savo teresa flavio tangianu sergio tempesta tommaso voci diego maurizio battino   the covid-19 pandemic is probably the most challenging health crisis of the modern era as of april 2020 more than 180 countries around the world have registered at least one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus infection with more than 25 million positive patients around the world 1 as the world health organizations general director pointed out testing is crucial 2 the detection of sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is achieved via the detection of the viral rna by real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 3 when properly collected and if the specimens collected for the analysis contains the virus rt-pcr has high specificity and sensitivity however this technique has some limitations such as the narrow number of patients that can be tested in a given time the increased risk of exposure to a high-dose of virus for the healthcare workers collecting the sample throat-swabbing can generate aerosol and a considerable amount of time from the test to its response 4 in addition if the sample is not properly collected which may be the case in a mass emergency screening where a single operator performs hundreds of swabs in a single shift this may lead to a high number of false-negative results with an overall sensitivity of about 3040 56 furthermore the rt-pcr requires certified laboratories expensive equipment and trained technicians to operate finally a major constraint remains the cutoff value to ascertain whether a test is positive or not generally when a given value is reached the specimen tested is considered positive however the degradation of the probe-based fluorophore by cross-contamination or by nonspecific amplification of background nucleic acids forces the adoption of an arbitrary cut off below which the medical report is given as negative this operating procedure outside the clinical context can lead to evaluation errors raising the number of false-negative results moreover real-time amplification efficiency varies within and between laboratories and a set cutoff might not be constant across runs therefore it is recommended to normalize cutoff with relative or absolute quantification approaches 7 the world health organization who has fostered the development of new strategies to standardize the diagnosis of covid-19 8 yet most countries have been completely unprepared for the onslaught of the virus a possible alternative to rt-pcr is the assessment of the immune response of the host to the virus however we cannot research covid-19 by merely translating the technologies and the know-how already in place and that comes from the study of other not comparable diseases in these three months since the beginning of the outbreak no protocols or real experimental studies have been carried out we still do not know about the immune response of the human body to sars-cov-2 and it is still unclear how we can evaluate the antibody production for the diagnosis of covid-19 and how to use igm and igg detection in single patients and the population for epidemiological purposes only recently the idea of producing easy-to-use decentralized point-of-care poc tests emerged and then deploying them widely 9 poc tests are simple easy to administer and to interpret and they can accelerate clinical decision-making and take some of the workload off centralized test laboratories for example sheridan 9 recently reported the current main commercial rapid test for sars-cov-2 in nature biotechnology some are ten-min lateral flow immunoassays that detect igm and igg antibodies directed against sars-cov-2 xiamen amonmed biotechnology fujian china technical specifications available from

chemiluminescence immunoassay system pharmact berlin germany deployed the poc 20-min test for detecting sars-cov-2 exposure through the identification of igg and igm antibodies biotech xiamen amonmed biotechnology sugentech snibe diagnostic and pharmact obtained the ce mark for their serological test cellex developed a similar one which is now also approved for the eu by the fda the available poc tests need to be studied in the current emergency setting the who proposed a protocol template better to assess the effectiveness of serology testing 12 this is also consistent with what is suggested in the updated version of laboratory testing for coronavirus disease covid-19 in suspected human cases 8 however it is currently impossible to assess and compare all the different poc tests because of the lack of reliable data as our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of covid-19 rapid tests and serological assays in real-life settings with a particular focus on territorial emergencies and the ongoing pandemic we designed a research protocol aimed to establish how to use these diagnostics correctly taking into account the different possible clinical and epidemiological scenarios covid-19 is the clinical presentation of the infection of the virus sars-cov-2 13 the diagnosis is currently based on the detection of the rna of the virus via a nucleic acid amplification test naat according to corman et al 14 rt-pcr has a sensitivity and specificity of about 100 provided that the sample is taken with the proper and timely technique the choice of the perfect samples to use for rt-pcr is still under debate wenling et al 15 analyzed samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sputum nasal swabs fibro-bronchoscopy brush biopsy pharyngeal swabs stools and blood rt-pcr on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated the highest positive rates 93 followed by sputum with 72 recent studies suggest the use of rt-pcr on stools because the virus can attack the bowel 16 according to ai et al 17 the combined use of computed tomography ct and pcr can increase diagnostic sensitivity however ct often is not available in territorial settings and primary care or for screening purposes according to el-tholoth et al 18 rt-pcr has some limitations for the screening and diagnosis of covid-19 because the test is difficult to use in the community and because of the high number of false-negatives observed the detection of specific igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 is a possible strategy to diagnose the infection the immune response triggered by the infection is currently under investigation similarly the long-term modification of the antibodies levels cannot be known at the moment the use of a fast performing validated a serological assay is requested by different authors such as xiao 19 and hick 20 but also the national health commission and state administration of traditional chinese medicine suggests the use of a serological test with igm and igg for covid-19 to confirm the negative results an emblematic example came from the recent italian experience patient zero was negative to all tests performed during the onset of the symptoms namely the pharyngo-nasal swab for rt-pcr and the serological test 19 these observations support the idea that two negative serological tests are necessary to rule out the infection when a quantitative analysis is available the following procedure should be respected two paired serum samples should be taken from the patient with a suspected diagnosis of covid-19 patients with clinical symptomology suggestive of the disease or close contacts with patients with a known positive test for sars-cov-2 infection baseline serum should be taken as early as possible within the incubation period of contact and convalescent serum should be taken 24 weeks after the last contact positive serum-specific igm or specific igg antibody title in the recovery phase 4 times higher than that in the acute phase can be used as diagnostic criteria for suspected patients with negative naat igm is usually measurable 10 days after symptom onset while igg is detectable 12 days after the patient is symptomatic in fact the optimal timing for the convalescent sample needs still to be established when compared to naat the serological test appears more suitable for screening purposes in a population a recent study from jin et al 20 emphasizes the utility of the serological test in a wide cohort also when there are few positive patients not only when the probability pre-test is high bai et al 21 used igm to define negative and positive case in wide samples from a general population and encouraged the use of the serological test also in asymptomatic patients to confine the spread of the outbreak this is also consistent with an interesting article by li et al 22 that recommends the use of serological surveys to determine the incidence of subclinical infections this test however may have some limitations to avoid false-positives because of cross-reactivity the antigen used for the serological test should come from properly purified sars-cov-2 according to meyer et al 23 and following the whos recommendations the right choice and the appropriate purification of antigens is essential to obtain validated serological tests in fact cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses can be challenging therefore only the most recent testsvalidated from laboratories that have isolated the viruscan be used serum antibody determination methods include among others colloidal gold immunochromatography elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay chemiluminescence immunoassay xiang et al 24 recently compared elisa to gica colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay both have high sensitivity and specificity without a significant difference h0ha 005 to enhance the accuracy of the diagnosis liu et al 25 suggested using rt-pcr in the first days from the infection and then to use the serological test alone for the disease monitoring li et al 10 described the results from the use of a rapid serological test in 525 patients the test had a sensitivity of 886 and a specificity of 9063 for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 immune response to a first-time infection needs time to grow symptoms can occur while the organism is preparing to fight and in the first days from infection the immunoassay can be negative indeed no cross-reactivity was detected in subjects with previous coronaviruses infection 26 a similar level of precision is reported by cassaniti et al in a letter to the editor where the authors do not endorse the use of the colloidal gold rapid test in emergency settings for triage of patients with suspected covid-19 26 nevertheless this recommendation remains controversial as there are some inconsistencies within the results presented the sampling methods the data processing and the patients targeted for the study on the other hand more recently long qx et al emphasized the importance of serological testing both in clinical and epidemiological settings 27 a rapid test for sars-cov-2 is the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip assay zhang et al 27 demonstrated that the eukaryotic spike proteins expressed rs1 and rs-rbd-mfc are more appropriate than the prokaryotic nucleocapsid proteins for covid-19 serological diagnosis the gica sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard rna-based tests they prepared six recombinant proteins including three s spike proteins rs1 rs-rbd rs-rbd-mfc and three n nucleocapsid proteins rn rn1 rn2 because the s protein is a transmembrane protein three s protein fragments were prepared using a eukaryotic expression system while three n proteins were prepared using a prokaryotic expression system preliminary evaluation by indirect elisa revealed that the three s proteins rs1 rs-rbd rs-rbd-mfc were superior in performance lower background and higher optical densit values to the three n proteins however the antigenicity of s proteins and that of the n proteins could not be confirmed in this study because the influence of prokaryotic expression method used to produce the n proteins is difficult to predict they speculated that this difference is due to the relatively high sensitivity and early response to the s antigen compared to the n antigen in patients with covid-19 thus the n proteins antigenicity should be studied after expression in a eukaryotic system in future zhang et al 28 selected two recombinant proteins with the highest elisa titers rs1 and rs-rbd-mfc to develop a sandwich-format gica strip to detect total antibodies igm and igg against hcov-19 gica colloidal gold immunochromatography assay a simple and rapid serological method is especially suitable for timely diagnosis and large-scale sample screening the performance of the gica strip which was evaluated with 814 clinical samples showed to be rapid 10 min highly sensitive 8689 and specific 9939 by diagnosing covid-19 in rt-pcr-negative patients who were clinically confirmed covid-19 positive by ct a recent study showed that the sensitivity of the total antibody igm and igg test is higher than that of the igm or igg test 29 currently there is no gold standard for the identification of covid-19 positive or negative subjects however the commonly adopted standard is the rt-pc carried out with the methods suggested by the who 2 we therefore selected the articles and data set where the control was the rt-pcr carried out on selected groups of people certainly negative eg healthy rt-pcr negative volunteers or affected by covid-19 rt-pcr positive symptomatic patients the data for the test validation are derived from li 10 capello 30 paradiso 31 cassaniti 26 as well as the data provided by the manufacturer provided by the producer alpha pharma inc bitonto bari 70031 italy available on httpswwwa-psit in the article by paradiso 31 it was not possible to deduce the data referring only to igm it should be noted that the specificity was very high in all studies table 1 all the trials included patients enrolled in the early stage of pandemics with no known exposure to sars-cov-2 and no symptoms of covid-19 ie healthy volunteers with no contact and asymptomatic and with negative rt-pcr those patients could be reasonably considered true negative subjects starting from this assumption basically no false positives were recorded nevertheless because of the peculiarity of this infection and because of the epidemiology of the pandemic a negative rt-pcr and a negative medical history cannot rule out a possible sars-cov-2 infection even in asymptomatic patients so that it would be difficult to compare the results of any test with a gold standard aimed to assess the sensitivity and sensibility of the test itself thus research protocols in the future should consider some specific features of the infection of the way it spreads among the population and of the immune response of the host to the disease for this reason the comparison with rt-pcr alone is not enough to establish the effectiveness of quantitative or qualitative serologic tests besides the long-time persistence of immunoglobulins in the serum of the immunized persons should be addressed as well as the absence of viral rna at the sites of the swabs that can give negative pcr results in healed immunized patients table 1 shows the sensitivity and specificity data of the colloidal gold rapid test versus rt-pcr oropharyngeal swab as published in individual articles cassaniti-a column was computed based on data reported in the article relative to igm still because of these reasons the collected sensitivity values may vary widely among the different studies consequently at present we cannot establish a mean sensitivity value in addition the variations are possibly determined by the time of testing and by the eligibility criteria which were not uniform in the different studies in any case the high precision indicates the absence of analytical errors determined by cross-reactivity as also reported by some authors 26 to better understand the variability in sensitivity and better assess the accuracy of the test we considered results of igg and igm testing separately we performed the analysis via the meta analytic approach to evaluate the heterogeneity of the effect size the results are shown in the forest plots of figure 1 igg and figure 2 igm for the igg figure 1 odds ratios we found both significant fixed p  0001 and random effects p  0001 heterogeneity was very high with cochrans q  461 p  00001 while the i2 statistic accounting for variations due to actual heterogeneity and not to chance was 902 ci 95 from 799 to 952 performing a second meta-analysis data not shown using all the pooled cassaniti igg data we did not find substantial differences for fixed effects we found again p  0001 whereas for random effects we obtained p  0002 cochrans q was 3778 p  00001 and the i2 statistic was 894 ci95 from 781 to 949 in addition for the igm figure 2 odds ratio we found significant fixed and random effects p  0001 in both cases heterogeneity was less high than igg for cochrans q we got 609 p  01072 thus a not significant heterogeneity even keeping p  01 as significance cutoff as suggested by higgins et al given the low number of studies 32 and the i2 statistic was found 508 ci95 from 00 to 837 furthermore for igm we performed a second meta-analysis data not shown using all the pooled cassaniti igm data for fixed and random effects we found again p  0001 with a cochrans q  502 p  01702 and the i2 statistic was 403 ci95 from 00 to 798 both meta-analyses revealed a high inconsistency at least in its broad confidence interval the i2 statistic is given by the ratio q-dq where d accounts for the degrees of freedom of the system eg the number of meta-analyzed studies minus one in the case d  q then one keeps i2  0 with a ci of 95 from 00 to 100 for this reason adding a study to the meta-analysis can potentially decrease the inconsistency if the studies are very few as in our case however the heterogeneity observed and therefore the inconsistency can also be explained by the differences in patient selection and in the timing of the test the time-lapse from time 0the moment of the possible contact and infectionto the time the test was performed it would be therefore advisable to produce clinical protocols that could standardize the procedure and the classification of patients including the time of possible exposure the prevalence of the disease in a population the time of the onset of the symptoms and the type and timing of other tests performed on the subjects in fact as the heterogeneity in sensitivity observed in the previous studies may depend on the different settings and the different timing it would be advisable to serially test patients recording and evaluating the immune response dynamics over time this is a research protocol based on a template addressing complexity that is aimed mainly to investigate the possible use of a rapid test for the evaluation of the disease in a population when specific conditions are considered although the result of a rapid diagnostic test offers only binary information positive or negative igm positive or negative igg the result can be crucial in assessing a patient when all the complexity of this disease is considered moreover it can provide a useful tool for the continuous screening of high-risk populations for the implementation of public health programs however as advised before the information coming from the test alone can be worthless if we do not consider the whole picture according to these criteria we classified the patients to be tested according to the possible inception point and therefore the possible clinical scenario we then produced different groups based on exposure and risk of exposure on the selection criteria and on the immune response to the different tests used to detect the infection these criteria are summarized in table 5 this classification allows the evaluation of the upper and the lower limits of the time-lapse where we can place the inception point for each group considered as for figure 3 aside from selected and limited cases in fact we cannot establish the exact time of the infection yet we can still gather valuable information if we evaluate the results of the test in different clusters and populations we consider for this specific purpose patients routinely attending primary care facilities or an outpatient department a general practitioners survey or any other health center in the communitywe might apply a similar scheme also in acute settings however we consider the peculiarity of the territorial emergency where asymptomatic patients can unconsciously spread the infection and the characteristics of a primary care department where patients can be followed-up over a longer period for our purpose enrolled patients would be classified according to the groups presented in table 5 and for their demographic features in addition all the available information on the recent and past medical history should be recorded with a particular focus on pre- and post-covid-19 results of laboratory testing and other investigations see table 3 and on behaviors or medical conditions that may increase the risk of becoming infected and of becoming seriously ill patients will be serially tested with the colloidal gold vivadiag covid-19 igmigg rapid test the suggested frequency is weekly a shorter interval may be suggested in high-risk settings each patient enrolled in the study would perform an rt-pcr test at the beginning of the study and if symptomatic patients should be regularly tested up to six months after the estimated time of contagion investigators will record the symptoms and any other medical investigation together with their date of onset and resolution the primary outcomes areto establish the accordance of the test with the clinical features of the disease and to assess how the test results change over time in the different clusters of patients as summarized in table 5to establish the reliability of the serologic rapid test to detect a sars-cov-2 infection and therefore its sensitivity and specificity when the integration of anamnestic clinical laboratory molecular imaging criteria are considered as the gold standard the secondary outcome is the comparison of the serological rapid test with the rt-pcr commonly used to make an etiological diagnosis of covid-19 in fact we cannot classify patients according to the results of a single test is positive or negative patients moreover the immune response of the host is still unknown as well as the level of immunity secondary to the infection thus the negative or positive status cannot be assessed and cannot be established by the result of a test the serological response should be interpreted with information coming from the clinical reports consequently before drafting conclusions the data analysis at the end of the study must consider the following considerationsif the test is positive even in the presence of a negative pcr the patient should be considered positive and treated according to his or her clinical picture when igm alone is positive the serological test shows a recent infection even if the patient has not developed any symptoms yet on the other hand if the test is positive for igg alone and the patient is asymptomatic the result can be used for epidemiological purposes some recent investigations 27 however show an inconsistent response of igm and igg in different patients with a seroconversion of both the immunoglobulin classes that reach 100 after a window periodif the test is negative in a symptomatic patient with a high exposure risk the serological test should be routinely repeated considering the window period between the time 0 of the infection and the production of circulating antibodies even if rapid tests are designed to reduce the measure errors to avoid a false negative it is essential to follow the producers instructions to avoid procedural mistakes for this reason we chose for our research protocol a test based on a very easy procedure such as those already in use for other diseases also in very limited settings and laboratories with very poor resources or auto-diagnostic kits the test is also easy to perform and to read for minimally trained personnel nevertheless because we do not have yes-or-no tests available and given the characteristic of covid-19 it is unlikely that those can be created in the future the clinical assessment of the patients remains crucial this implies that medical history should be correctly collected and clinical signs must be accurately recorded to increase the chance of making a proper diagnosis prognosis and management plan lastly all the data collected should be shared with other researchers to prompt further studies and consequently the whole dataset should always be made available this protocol dubs a first research trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04316728 available from httpclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04316728 aimed at evaluating the immune response of negative patients during a covid-19 outbreak plus the clinical performance of the test in early detection the infection and the reliability of the test in those patients who develop clinical signs of covid-19 during the trial preliminary unpublished data match the observations reported in table 1 showing a good correspondence with other research studies and also suggesting a role of serological test for the screening of asymptomatic patients the 2020 novel coronavirus pandemic is showing how weak the idea of global health is this worldwide emergency asks and needs prompt answers and original solutions the early diagnosis of coronavirus remains a major issue as a proper screening strategy can improve the design and implementation of workable public health models aimed to confine the virus and to reduce its devastating effect on the population it is therefore paramountalso considering the clinical complexity of this new diseaseto develop accurate user-friendly kits that can help doctors and healthcare workers to make a diagnosis of covid-19 thus molecular scientists must be front-runners in this race against the virus providing their expertise and the unique research capability of their field we investigated the quick detection approach targeting viral igm or igg antibodies with the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic icg strip assay in comparison with real-time rt-pcr testing the advantages of the icg strip viral antibody detection are obvious first of all the sensitivity of the icg strip is comparable especially after 7 days of onset the detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative clinically diagnostic patients is impressive therefore icg strips are highly recommended to be utilized as the supplementary diagnostic approach in clinical applications the icg strip can also be widely adopted in areas where diagnostic capacity is limited secondary the icg strip assay is operational as it is ready to use and timesaving the assay can be finished within 15 min without specialized equipment third unlike oral swab sampling that may cause stimulated retching and coughing which increases the exposure risk of laboratory technicians the blood collection could avoid the unnecessary risk and reduce the operation steps that may cause aerosol fourth the detection of antibodies may also indicate the disease recovery as immunoglobulins are among the most important soldiers in the battle of viruses patients who initially detected as virus-positive and gradually became negative but with detectable igg or igm during the disease progression may be considered as recovered from this battle it is noteworthy that the icg strip can only provide qualitative results but the serological elisa assay against the viral antibody offered the quantitative antibody titer and is regarded as the superior alternation at this point last but not least the strip can be used for community surveillance and therefore for the design of public health strategies aimed to confine the dissemination of the virus to contain an ongoing epidemic and to call off whatever restrictions and measures are needed to reduce the spread of the disease in a timely manner in conclusion the main advantages of the serological test are higher accuracy in detecting a sars-cov-2 infection even in asymptomatic patients or before the onset of the symptoms when the test is performed after a significant amount of time from the suspect day of contagion and the simpler way of use that allows operators with minimal training to screen a high number of people with fewer sampling mistakes finally it reduces the exposure of health workers performing the test to the virus taking into account the background and in particular long results 27 we speculate that serological tests although needing to be more thoroughly studied could be indispensable weapons for front-line doctors who work in a decentralized setting to have rapid answers therefore it is crucial to gather all the possible information every time a patient is tested and assessed to understand better how the infection and the immune response work so that we can build risk classes and individual and population profiles that could help clinicians and health policy-makers to define a better strategy to fight the infection and the spread of the disease allowing at the same time people and society to safely go back to normal or more regular life we finally endorse and foster a proactive collaboration among molecular researchers and clinicians with the creation of multicentric studies aimed to produce tools that can be used as weapons for the war against this invisible enemy that may undermine the future of the same humankind  molecular targets for the testing of covid19 suh yong kuan pingchia su yuhshyong yang   the pandemic outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 were first discovered in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 the covid19 was caused by the novel coronavirus namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 it took 30 days to spread to all provinces of china

1

 and has been reported from about 200 countries by march 30 2020

2

 the sarscov2 was named because it shares 88 nucleotide similarity to two batderived severe acute respiratory syndrome sarslike coronaviruses and 79 similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov that appeared in 2003 which affected 26 countries and killed about 800 people

 there are four common types of human coronavirus that have been reported such as hku1 nl63 229e and oc43 that cause the mild symptom of common flu whereas sarscov middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus merscov and novel sarscov2 were reported causing severe or fatal symptoms the coronavirus is an enveloped nonsegmented positivesense and singlestranded rna virus with a crownlike appearance figure

 shows the coronavirus structure that composes four types of protein such as spike glycoprotein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n the s protein is playing an important role in invading into the host by interacting with human receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptorbinding domain rbd of s protein contributed its immunogenic that attracted many neutralizing antibodies

 they are all potential molecular targets for the identification of sarscov2 infection currently there is no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine for covid19 therefore it is necessary to deploy a robust diagnostic methodology which is rapid accurate and ultrasensitive to isolate infected patients from the healthy population the testing of sarscov2 is grouped into molecular testing and serology testing the molecular testing includes nucleic acid amplification test naat such as realtime reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction rrtpcr

7

 according to world health organization who interim guidance on laboratory testing of covid19 in suspected human

7

 the respiratory materials were required to collect to perform naat the unique sequence rna of the virus including nucleocapsid n envelope e spike protein s and rnadependent rnapolymerase rdrp genes are targeted to analyze using rrtpcr

8

 on january 23 2020 the first covid19 detection kit using rrtpcr was published which targeted rdrp n and e genes of sarscov2

8

 as of now there are many inhouse or commercial covid19 molecular assays available from worldwide for instance 1 cdc 2019ncov realtime reverse transcriptase pcr diagnostic panel was developed by the united states centers for disease control and prevention this diagnostic panel is working with applied biosystems 7500 fast dx realtime pcr instrument with sds 14 software 2 new coronavirus nucleic acid assay which targeted on orf1ab and n genes was developed by chinese national institute for viral disease control and prevention 3 molecular test kits from four companies such as seegene inc kogene biotech co ltd sd biosensor inc and solgent co were approved by ministry food and drug safety and korea centers for disease control and prevention which are now widely being used in south korea

9

 primer and probe design are critical for the detection of or viral rna that is easy to mutate taiwan centers for disease control provides rrtpcr primers targeting e rdrp and n genes for firstline screening confirmatory and additional confirmatory assay respectively the outbreaks of the covid19 pandemic have led to an increase of thousands of active cases every day all over the world and we are racing against time to find a test to quickly detect the virus and isolate the infected patient from healthy population to stop the virus transmission from a further outbreak the united states food and drug administration is moving fast to approve a few covid19 molecular test kits under emergency use authorization powers cepheid inc mesa biotech inc and biofire defense llc were recently granted food and drug administration fda approval of their rapid diagnostic test that could give the test result reduced to 1 h compared to traditional rtpcr methods that required 34 h on march 27 2020 abbott announced the launch of a molecular pointofcare test which uses an isothermal rna amplification method to deliver positive results in 5 min and negative results in 13 min it is expected to produce about 5 million tests per month httpswwwabbottcomcorpnewsroomproduct-and-innovationdetect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minuteshtml in addition to its rna the s and the n proteins are frequent targets for the detection of conorovirus in contrast to that of the rna the development of a detection kit on viral proteins is still in progress a probe usually a specific antibody is needed before a successful viral protein detection method can be developed in early march 2020 academia sinica taiwan reported the first monoclonal antibody against n protein of sarscov2 with their antibody library in hand the team screened against n proteins from seven different viral species to obtain 1 antibody against only sarscov2 n protein 9 against only sarscov n protein and 36 against both sarscov2 and sarscov n proteins

10

 the results indicated that rapid immunebased test kit of sarscov2 coronavirus can be developed in the future it also shows the complexity and time consumed in obtaining and screening an antibody for an unbiased test targeting specific viral protein the procedure for the preparation of specific antibody from laboratory animal has been very well established and it could be expected that numerous antibodies specific for a sarscov2 protein will be reported soon 25 strains of antibodies from three covid19 patients have also been prepared from chang gung memorial hospital taiwan there are 13 strains of monoclonal antibodies mabs targeting on s protein and 12 strains of mabs targeting on n protein of the sarscov2 these antibodies especially those targeting on s protein can be a potential probe for the detection of s protein or the whole sarscov2 virus the advantage of immunebased vial detection is its simplicity and speed within 15 min however the antibodies prepared from sarscov2 protein antigen may crossreact with proteins from other similar viruses such as sarscov and mers and thus a tedious screening procedure is needed before a specific testing kit can be developed as aforementioned the serology testing of covid19 is not targeting the virus itself but the antibodies such as immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg induced following viral infection these immunoglobulins were serological testing markers for after the patient has early 36 days after exposure to the virus igm and late virus infections after 8 days igg response respectively

11

 the serological testing is crucial to identify active patients asymptomatic carriers or convalescent persons and provide population surveillance these data could be used to analyze and estimate the sarscov2 epidemiology and virology

12

 and help to contain the outbreak of the pandemic the highly reactive human could be the donor of convalescent serum for therapeutic

13

 the who interim guidance on covid19 testing suggested collecting blood stool or autopsy materials such as lungs deceased patients as serology testing specimens

7

 as it has been reported that several factors could contribute to a high falsenegative rate when using naat serology testing should also be taken into consideration as alternative testing or correlation testing

14

 there are companies such as guangzhou wondfo biotech china innovita biological technology china pharma berlin germany and raybiotech inc usa that have released various types of test kits that specifically test on covid19 igm and igg specificity and sensitivity are two fundamental requirements for an effective diagnosis it is also important that the testing method is user friendly rna detection is the most frequently used method for the identification of covid19 patients because this method is extremely sensitive due to the power of nucleic acid amplification and also highly specific by using complementary nucleic acid probeprimer for the identification of a particular rna the major drawback in such an emergency situation is probably the requirement of welltrained personnel and lengthy testing time usually 34 h to run the test however it has been announced that positivenegative covid19 can be determined in about 10 min by using the isothermal amplification method this may due to the simplification of the naat procedure and the high amount of the sarscov2 at the beginning of the infection to be detected detections on viral proteins such as s and n proteins give complementary information to that of rna detection from the same sample this method is more direct without amplification but is less sensitive it needs more effort to obtain a suitable probe usually antibody but the testing method can be simple recent developments in biosensing technologies can significantly improve the protein sensing sensitivity such as the use of magnetic bead to concentrate the protein molecules or by applying nanowire fieldeffect transistor as a transducer many of the entrepreneurs may take this opportunity to fasten their product development serology testings targeting on viralinduced antibodies are given different information as those for viral rna and proteins from sarscov2 although the protein testing method is similar the targets are not part of the virus and the testing specimens used can be quite different as compared to those for viral protein detection it is unfortunate that the world is currently suffering from the covid19 epidemic however we should expect that such an incident would reappear we wish that the world would be better prepared every time we face a potential spread of an infectious disease biosensing technologies have progressed rapidly in the past decade the pandemic outbreaks of covid19 continue to remind us that diagnostic tools are critical and needed to be prepared in advance suh kuan yong pingchia su and yuhshyong yang

study protocol active surveillance for respiratory infections was performed at rochester general hospital rochester new york from 15 november 1999 to 15 april 2000 as part of an ongoing study to identify influenza and rsv infections all patients 65 years old and those with underlying heart or lung conditions admitted with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection bronchitis exacerbation of copd congestive heart failure chf influenza or pneumonia were invited to participate demographic and clinical information was collected during patient interviews and from medical records combined nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were tested for influenza virus and rsv by culture and rt-pcr acute and convalescent blood samples at 4 weeks were obtained for serologic testing in as many cases as possible during the 5 months of surveillance 332 illnesses in 316 hospitalized persons were evaluated sixty-one cases of influenza a infection and 22 cases of rsv infection were identified and excluded from subsequent analysis of the 249 remaining cases 100 samples were randomly selected for rhinovirus and coronavirus testing 
laboratory methods for rhinovirus and coronavirus rt-pcr rtpcr for human rhinovirus hrv and human coronaviruses hcv was done by methods described elsewhere with minor modifications 12 13 total rna was extracted from 200 l of sample by matrix affinity chromatography qiaamp dna blood kit qiagen the eluted rna was transcribed into cdna with murine reverse transcriptase mmlv-rt gibco brl and virus specific oligonucleotide primer for 1 h at 37c after mmlv-rt denaturation at 95c virus-specific 5 biotinylated oligonucleotide primer and taq polymerase applied biosystems were added and 35 cycles of pcr were run consisting of denaturation 1 min at 95c for hrv 2 min at 95c for hcv annealing 15 min at 482c for hrv 1 min at 60c for hcv and dna extension for 1 min at 72c the pairs of primers for coronaviruses oc43 and 229e were used in the same reaction in a multiplex format excess primers dntps taq dna polymerase and salts were removed by adsorbing the amplified product to the qiaquick silica-gel membrane qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen the presence of the pcr product was detected by microplate hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled virusspecific probes as described elsewhere 13 positive and negative controls were previously tested nasal washings either containing or lacking specific hrv or hcv rna 
laboratory methods for coronavirus serologic testing serologic evidence of coronavirus infection was defined as a 3-fold increase in coronavirus-specific igg as measured by eia coronavirus 229e antigens were prepared from infected wi-38 cell lysates and oc43 antigens in suckling mouse brains eia plates were coated with either 229e or oc43 antigens to nunc flat-bottom plates in bicarbonate buffer control plates were prepared by using uninfected wi-38 cell lysates or mouse brain suspensions serum samples obtained during acute and convalescent illness acute and convalescent serumsamples were added to wells in duplicate in serial 2-fold dilutions from 1400 to 102400 serum igg was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human antibody followed by substrate the end-point titer was defined as the highest dilution with an optical density 0100 that was at least twice that of the control plate 6 
statistical methods means were compared with students t test and proportions were compared using 2 and fishers exact tests as appropriate of the 100 cases evaluated rhinovirus andor coronavirus were identified as a pathogen in 12 of them four nasal specimens were rt-pcr positive for rhinovirus 4 were positive for coronavirus 229e 1 was positive for coronavirus oc43 and 1was positive for both rhinovirus and coronavirus 229e of the 100 cases acute and convalescent serum samples were available for 88 of them from which 2 additional oc43 infections were identified the 6 patients who tested positive by pcr for coronaviruses were seronegative for coronavirus rhinovirus infections occurred sporadically throughout the winter although coronavirus oc43 infections occurred primarily in december and january and coronavirus 229e infections occurred primarily in march and april the mean sd age of patients was 74  11 years with similar numbers of men and women in both groups table 1 all patients had significant underlying chronic medical conditions primarily chf and copd and 1 patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll consistent with the high rate of lung disease 92 were active or previous smokers 33 took corticosteroids daily and 50 received oxygen at home seventy-five percent had exposure to young children compared with patients infected with influenza during the same period the rhinoviruscoronavirus group had significantly more lung disease nasal congestion and cough were common symptoms 67 and 78 respectively as were lower respiratory tract symptoms of dyspnea 83 and sputum production 58 constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and myalgias occurred in only 33 of patients with hrv or hcv compared with 54 in influenza virus-infected patients fever was significantly less common in the hrv and hcv group than in the influenza group mean temperature 374c10c vs 384c11c p  005 patients were quite ill at admission with 75 demonstrating wheezing and rales by auscultation supplemental oxygen was required for all but 1 individual most patients received steroids 75 bronchodilators 83 and antibiotics 83 all patients eventually recovered and were discharged after a mean length of stay of 8 days there were no distinct features of rhinovirus or coronavirus infection four patients had radiographically proven pneumonia 2 with coronavirus and 2 with rhinovirus infection one 89-year-old woman with rhinovirus infection had a history of copd and presented with a temperature of 393c an sao2 level of 57 and an infiltrate on chest x-rayno blood or sputumcultures were obtained the other rhinovirus-positive patient with pneumonia had cll a temperature of 390c and blood and sputum cultures that grew no pathogens both patients with coronavirus infection and pneumonia were elderly women with chf and presented with nasal congestion cough and dyspnea and had visible rhinorrhea at examination blood cultures were sterile and 1 patient tested positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa in an inadequate sputum sample two individuals without pneumonia had evidence of concurrent bacterial infection 1 patient with positive coronavirus serologic test results had streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the sputum of 1 person with coronavirus 229e during a winter season when influenza was prevalent and accounted for a substantial number of hospitalizations rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were diagnosed by rt-pcr and serologic testing in 12 of patients without influenza or with rsv these data provide more evidence that not all serious respiratory illnesses that occur during the winter months are always the flu our results are consistent with a recent study by el-sahly et al 9 documenting coronavirusrhinovirus infections in 26 47 of 546 persons x003e35 years old who were hospitalizedwith cardiopulmonary illnesses and with a 4-year study by glezen et al 4 in which viruses were found to be a common trigger for acute decompensation leading to hospitalization in persons with preexisting lung diseases in the latter study of 417 adults 45 years old who were hospitalized for respiratory infections influenza viruses were detected most frequently in 8 of patients whereas rhinoviruses were detected in 2 and coronaviruses in 3 of patients however this study did not use rt-pcr to detect viruses and rates likelywould have been higher if more-sensitive diagnostic tools were available in a study of inner-city adults with asthma rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were more common than influenza in patients presenting to an emergency room 10 sixty percent of rhinovirus and 71 of coronavirus infections were detectable only by rt-pcr the higher rate of infection in our study likely reflects the use of rt-pcr rather than culture for diagnosis aswell as the months studied and the elderly population a limitation of this study is the lack of a control group of hospitalized elderly patients without respiratory illnesses previous studies have shown that rhinoviruses may be detected in 3 of asymptomatic elderly adults 11 the use of a method of diagnosis that detects minute quantities of rna raises the question of the role of the virus in causality of the illness unfortunately samples from a control group were not available it was not unexpected that there were patients with positive coronavirus pcr results but negative serologic test results since antibody responses may be impaired in frail elderly persons of note persons hospitalized because of rhinoviruscoronavirus infections were more frail than those with influenza with all persons having either significant cardiopulmonary disease or cancer this finding is consistent with a study by nicholson et al 11 in which the presence of chronic medical conditions or smoking increased the risk of lower respiratory tract disease by 40 in elderly adults with rhinovirus infection in the study by el-sahly et al 9 asthma copd or chf was present in 73 of patients 35 years old who were hospitalized because of rhinovirus or coronavirus infections in additionwald et al 5 found that rhinovirus infections produced more-protracted lower respiratory tract symptoms in nursing home residents with copd or a history of smoking illnesses were significant with the mean length of stay 1 week and nearly all patients received supplemental oxygen steroids and antibiotics one patient required intensive care but all survivedof interest 2 patientswith rhinovirus infections had high fevers and radiographic evidence of pneumonia rhinoviruses are rarely implicated as a cause of pneumonia which is believed to reflect their biologic characteristics 14 however recent data from papadopoulos et al 15 suggest that infection of the lower airways is possible and that rhinoviruses may have direct effects on the lower respiratory tract epithelium the high frequency of lower respiratory tract symptoms in ambulatory elderly persons with rhinovirus infections and the recovery of rhinovirus from expectorated sputum samples are additional evidence for viral invasion of the lower airways 5 11 it is unknown how often bacterial suprainfection in the lower respiratory tract follows hrv or hcv infection despite these uncertainties mixed viralbacterial infection in our patients seems likely although one person had cll thus making a viral pneumonia a possibility in summary infectionwith agents that typically cause colds in young adults may lead to hospitalization in frail elderly persons with underlying heart and lung problems it does not appear that healthy elderly persons are at high risk from these agents these viruses although not as common as influenza and rsv among hospitalized adults also circulate during the winter months producing similar clinical syndromes the use of rt-pcr improves the ability to identify these previously difficult to detect viruses but further studies with control groups are needed to fully define the impact of hcv and hrv in hospitalized elderly adults  the important role of serology for covid-19 control amy winter k sonia hegde t   as of april 14 2020 just under 2 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have been reported worldwide1 with the pandemic growing at an alarming rate and national governments struggling to control local epidemics because of scant diagnostics and impermanent non-pharmaceutical interventions we should look to additional epidemiological solutions locations such as singapore and taiwan have been successful in slowing epidemic growth by using intensive surveillance with broader testing strategies to identify and contain cases2 3
 in the lancet infectious diseases sarah ee fang yong and colleagues4 report three clusters of covid-19 cases identified in singapore in early 2020 by active case-finding and contact tracing and confirmed with rt-pcr one cluster from a church church a was previously identified5 and linked to two imported cases from wuhan china the two additional clusters church b and a family gathering were attributable to community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by one individual interacting with both clusters serological platforms were developed and assessed for confirmation of sars-cov-2-specific antibody responses to capture past infections by serological analysis yong and colleagues identified the missing link between the church a cluster and the other two clustersan individual who had twice tested negative by rt-pcr by linking all three clusters yong and colleagues highlight the success of such surveillance measures to capture many cases and effectively slow the spread of covid-19 in singapore this investigation exemplifies the failings of rt-pcr as a sole diagnostic method in surveillance because of its inability to detect past infection and the added value of serological testing which if captured within the correct timeframe after disease onset can detect both active and past infections6 7 in public health practice serological analysis can be useful for rapid case-identification and the subsequent chain of events to actively identify close contacts recommend quarantine and define clusters of cases contact tracing which is a necessary but insufficient means of disease control needs careful effort and is sensitive to timing to be effective particularly in highly dense populations as shown in singapore serological analysis can be useful for contact tracing in urban environments and linking clusters of cases retrospectively to delineate transmission chains and ascertain how long transmission has been ongoing or to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population beyond the immediate use of serological data to identify and contain cases these data can also be used to set control policies population serological testing specifically measuring sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody titres can estimate the total number of infections by assessing the number of individuals who have mounted an immune response regardless of whether an infection was subclinical or happened in the recent past current data suggest antibodies persist for at least 4 weeks8 by providing estimates of who is and is not immune to sars-cov-2 serological data can be used in at least four ways first to estimate epidemiological variables such as the attack rate or case-fatality rate which are necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred and its burden second to strategically deploy immune health-care workers to reduce exposure of the virus to susceptible individuals third to assess the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions at the population-level and inform policy changes to release such measures fourth to identify individuals who mounted a strong immunological response to the virus and whose antibody isolates can be used to treat patients via plasma therapy9
 although the potential for serological assays to help control the covid-19 pandemic is substantial the complexity of developing and validating a diagnostic test is not fully elucidated by yong and colleagues4 serological assays are currently being developed for widespread use10 yet several challenges remain first assessing the sensitivity and specificity of tests particularly for determining disease during the acute phase of infection second verifying the test is not detecting cross-reactivity with other viral pathogens that result in false-positive results third understanding antibody kinetics over time to distinguish thresholds of immunity because we do not know how long immunity to this novel coronavirus might last and finally ensuring the test is reliable for distribution and is cost-efficient although rt-pcr diagnostics will still be vital for identifying acute infection as the sars-cov-2 pandemic continues to spread and cases accumulate serological testing and data will prove increasingly important to understand the pandemics past and predict its future 

  virological and serological analysis of a recent middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection case on a triple combination antiviral regimen nikolaos spanakis sotirios tsiodras bart haagmans l v raj stalin kostantinos pontikis antonia koutsoukou nikolaos koulouris g albert osterhaus dme marion koopmans pg athanassios tsakris   an upsurge of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection has been recently described in countries of the arabian peninsula resulting in exported cases from these countries to the european union 1 cases of mers-cov infection are associated with a high case fatality rate since there is no available treatment there is a scarcity of data on specific therapeutic interventions for the disease published reports propose the use of known antivirals based on extrapolation of data from i the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic that was also associated with the circulation of a novel coronavirus ii in vitro data iii animal experimental infections and therapy data and iv limited clinical data for actual mers-cov infections 2 3 4 however no clear-cut recommended therapeutic regimen exists and the evidence for grading such interventions is generally low with the exception of the use of convalescent serum that based on biological effects is given the highest grade 5 moreover little is known about the viral kinetics of mers-cov-associated infection especially when a specific antiviral or other therapeutic intervention is attempted a case of mers-cov has recently been described in greece in a traveller who had extensive contact with the healthcare environment in jeddah saudi arabia 6 here we describe molecular serological and phylogenetic analyses of this case as well as evidence for a second case that was a close contact of the first patient furthermore we provide evidence of the kinetics and the pattern of viral excretion in biological specimens obtained from the first greek case while the patient was on a triple antiviral regimen a preliminary report of the first imported laboratory-confirmed mers-cov case in greece has been described elsewhere 6 a full description of the course of illness and treatment regimen in relation to kinetics of virus shedding and immune response was prepared by review of the patient records in the course of the outbreak investigation 40 of 75 patients contacts including the patients wife provided an oropharyngeal sample for pcr testing 1 week after contact with the positive case 5 additional contacts were included in the serology examination group all were submitted to personal clinical monitoring for fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms and were advised to call the hellenic centre for disease control and prevention cdc command centre immediately in such an instance in addition all were offered the chance to provide serum samples on a voluntary basis for specific anti-mers antibody testing at baseline same time as the oropharyngeal pcr testing and 3 weeks after exposure during the patients stay in the intensive care unit icu samples from the oropharynx trachea urine and faeces were tested for diagnostic evaluation and to monitor viral shedding a real-time reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr method based on amplification of the upstream envelope gene upe the nucleocapsid n gene and the open reading frame orf 1a of the virus was used for detection of mers-cov according to previously described methodology 7 8 immunoglobulin g igg and igm antibody titres in serum samples were determined using an anti-mers-cov indirect immunofluorescence assay euroimmun ag lbeck germany confirmation of the serological findings was performed with a virus neutralisation assay as described previously 9 samples from the patients upper respiratory tract underwent conventional or molecular testing for the presence of other respiratory pathogens thus cultures applied for bacterial testing whilst real-time rt-pcr was performed for

marcy-ltoile france specific urine antigen testing of urine samples was utilised for legionella pneumophila and streptococcus pneumoniae binaxnow alere orlando fl a stool culture was performed due to a history of possible typhoid fever diagnosed by treating physicians in saudi arabia 6 nucleotide sequences of 3-kb concatenated sequences of representative mers-covs were analysed and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the phyml method as described previously 10 a 69-year-old patient of greek origin who was a permanent resident of jeddah presented to a tertiary care centre a few hours after arriving in athens greece on 17 april 2014 his chief complaints included fever since 8 april 2014 and diarrhoea since 10 april 2014 the most likely source of exposure was the hospital environment in jeddah the patient had no known co-morbidities at the time of initial evaluation a fever of 383 c was noted together with low oxygen saturation 92 although the patient exhibited minimal respiratory symptoms a chest radiograph depicted bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonia the patient was immediately placed under isolation because of suspicion of mers-cov infection and an antimicrobial regimen targeting community-acquired pneumonia was initiated on 18 april 2014 mers-cov infection was confirmed by means of viral rna detection in a pharyngeal swab at the department of microbiology university of athens medical school athens greece after laboratory confirmation of mers-cov the patient was transferred to a specialised respiratory disease unit in the sotiria chest diseases hospital of athens where he was treated in a negative pressure regular room in isolation until 20 april 2014 when due to deterioration of his respiratory function and development of acute respiratory disease syndrome ards he was intubated ventilated and transferred to a negative pressure room in the icu of the same hospital an empirical antiviral regimen was initiated on day 13 of illness consisting of oral po lopinavirritonavir 400100 mg twice daily pegylated interferon 180 g subcutaneously once per week for 12 days and ribavirin 2000 mg po loading dose followed by 1200 mg po every 8 h for 8 days based on available evidence 3 4 5 11 12 fig 1
 the patient remained intubated exhibiting hypoxia and occasionally hypercapnia while breathing inspired oxygen in the range of 045060 he remained febrile with a plateau temperature of 39 c and a maximum value of 405 c on day 18 of illness fever started subsiding below 38 c on day 22 acute kidney injury was diagnosed on day 16 of illness and rapidly progressed to non-oliguric renal failure that reverted to rifle injury level ie two-fold increase in the serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate decrease by 50 or urine output 05 mlkgh for 12 h on day 21 the patients diarrhoea resolved gradually starting on day 13 and he developed constipation thereafter with normalisation of his bowel movements and gastrointestinal function on day 19 owing to development of jaundice and hyperbilirubinaemia attributed to ribavirin 13 the drug was discontinued on day 20 during the course of his hospitalisation the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon and eventually died from septic shock 2 months and 19 days after the initial diagnosis cultures and antigen detection were negative for l pneumophila and s pneumoniae virological testing was negative for the presence of any other respiratory virus no relevant enteric pathogens were identified as a cause of the patients diarrhoea rna was detected in several consecutive patient samples from different sites that included faecal material and serum fig 1 shedding of mers-cov in the respiratory secretions of the patient was noted until the fourth week of illness whereas viraemia was last detected 15 days after onset of illness and 2 days after initiation of the triple combination antiviral regimen consecutive urine testing did not reveal the presence of mers-cov rna fig 1 serological testing showed a peak igg titre during the third week of illness whilst during the fourth and fifth weeks igg titres were substantially declining igm titres were persistently elevated during the whole survey period day 13 until day 34 of illness fig 1 viral neutralisation assays performed at erasmus medical center rotterdam the netherlands confirmed the immunofluorescence testing results initial and follow-up serological testing were performed on serum samples from 45 patients contacts seroconversion was revealed in one of them who developed an igg titre of 1500 and an igm titre of 1100 at 21 days after making contact with the patient this was a 63-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery heart disease and diabetes the presence of specific mers-cov antibodies was confirmed by the virus neutralisation assay case investigation disclosed that the person who seroconverted had close contact with the first mers-cov case diagnosed in greece on 18 april 2014 he had close contact with the index case for ca 3 h and drove the index patient to the hospital on 17 april 2014 he had been identified as a close contact during the contact tracing conducted by the hellenic cdc at the time and he was submitted to the following testing according to the protocol used for the investigation of close contacts by the hellenic cdc i nasopharyngeal testing by pcr on 23 april 2014 negative ii serology testing on 23 april 2014 negative and iii serology testing on 8 may 2014 positive the patient reported developing only fever up to 385 c from 4 to 7 may 2014 without other symptoms from any other system no nasopharyngeal pcr testing was performed at the time since he was outside the incubation period of 14 days he has been well since then and during the time that he was symptomatic he only had contact with his family members four persons the initial patients wife had a brief episode of fever on 30 may 2014 oropharyngeal pcr testing was negative for mers-cov and all contacts remained seronegative on repeat testing partial genomic sequencing 14 revealed the close phylogenetic relationship with clinical mers-cov strains associated with severe respiratory infection from patients in jeddah fig 2
 in this report we further characterised serological and virological parameters of the first mers-cov case in greece rising titres of igg were demonstrated in sequential serum samples with the peak titres approximately 3 weeks into the course of the disease this is in accordance with serological testing guidance from the world health organization who recommending baseline testing from initial contact with an affected case and repeated serological testing on day 21 15 on the other hand igm titres of the patient remained constantly elevated above the threshold of detection albeit at a lower level than igg antibodies for a prolonged period of 1 month of follow-up thus isolated use of igm testing without concomitant igg determination appears not to be sufficient to reveal a recent infection it should be noted however that in the absence of detailed studies use of serological testing for mers-cov detection in humans needs to be further evaluated prolonged shedding of the virus was noted from the respiratory tract of the patient this finding is consistent with data regarding the sars coronavirus in a report dealing with patients affected by sars prolonged shedding of the virus was noted in stool up to 126 days and respiratory specimens up to 52 days 16 data regarding the length of mers-cov excretion from different body sites are scarce 17 excretion of the virus probably depends on the amplitude of replication in different body sites the underlying immune status and co-morbidities and appropriate antiviral therapy the non-detectable viral rna in serum by day 3 after initiation of the antiviral treatment could be explained either by viral clearance in an otherwise immunocompetent person or by effectiveness of the instituted antiviral regimen literature on appropriate antiviral intervention for mers-cov is very limited and currently no evidence-based therapy exists the regimen chosen was based on the best available literature as well as evidence from animal and patient data that have been described elsewhere 2 3 4 the role of interferon therapy for mers-cov infection needs to be further elucidated an attenuated interferon- ifn- response has been described as a result of mers-cov infection 18 and extensive use of interferon-based regimens alone or in combination with ribavirin has been described for sars 4 however interferons appear to have a better antiviral effect on mers-cov compared with sars-cov in in vitro experiments 19 in vitro ifn- appears to exhibit the best anti-mers-cov effect 20 interferon activity has been enhanced by the addition of ribavirin in in vitro experiments 21 furthermore this combination has shown promising clinical and radiological effects in rhesus macaques experimentally infected with mers-cov 12 thus the clinical team elected to use this combination despite the fact that a prestigious public health agency ranks ribavirin use as not supported by high-quality evidence 5 in a more recent update published by the same public health agency the use of interferons and lopinavir is ranked under the recommendation of benefit is likely to exceed risk whereas the combination of interferon and ribavirin is ranked as data are inadequate for assessment 22 the frequent side effects of ribavirin limit its use in combination regimens for actual mers-cov-infected patients as was the experience with the current patient where liver toxicity although not definitively associated was mainly attributed to this medication the renal function deterioration of the patient described here was considered multifactorial and probably also a complication of the virus infection 23 the possibility that drug toxicity might have contributed in the renal dysfunction could not be excluded however no drug levels were measured since the patient was under continuous renal replacement therapy at that time and drug levels would be unreliable in the actual clinical human setting the combination of ribavirin and interferon has been tried with no successful outcome reported among any of the mers-cov-infected recipients 3 nevertheless the group studied consisted of severely ill patients who received this combination quite late in the course of their disease 3 lastly we added the protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir based on experience accumulated from the sars epidemic where the addition of this agent to ribavirin improved the outcome of infection 24 expanding the knowledge regarding viral kinetics and the pattern of shedding especially in association with specific therapeutic interventions has important implications for infection control in the healthcare environment especially as it relates to potential transmission to other patients and healthcare workers 25 phylogenetic analysis of the greek mers-cov strain showed close similarity with circulating patient viral strains from the recent jeddah outbreak as well as with a strain isolated from a dromedary camel in qatar this is in accordance with previous genetic studies that have shown identical viral strains between infected humans and dromedary camels and generated the hypothesis that dromedary camels are among the reservoirs of the virus in nature 10 26 also the presence of mers-cov-specific antibodies in camels across a wide geographic area in africa and the arabian peninsula signifies the possibility for zoonotic transmission between camels and humans 27 28 29 the potential for transmission across different individual strains should be further explored in this patient the most likely source of exposure was the hospital environment in an endemic area as his wife was hospitalised in a local hospital in jeddah 6 it appears that healthcare-associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the mers-cov epidemic in the recent upsurge 30 in conclusion we describe the genetic stability of the mers-cov in a strain from the recent jeddah outbreak although reassuring this finding should not limit the level of awareness regarding the increased number of cases in the arabian peninsula reported recently and the potential evolution and more efficient transmission of the virus a who committee recently concluded that the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern have not yet been met nevertheless important gaps in current knowledge about mers-cov exist more investigations to clarify the natural reservoir and modes of transmission are necessary persistence of virus shedding in patients secretions and the effect of immune status and antiviral therapy together with the implementation of appropriate infection control measures are of paramount importance in limiting further spread of this potentially lethal virus

ethical approval not required  differentiation of feline coronavirus type i and ii infections by virus neutralization test nozomi shiba ken maeda hirotomo kato masami mochizuki hiroyuki iwata   feline infectious peritonitis fip is a highly fatal and immune-mediated pyogranulomatous disease that occurs in both domestic and wild felidae the disease is caused by feline coronavirus fcov fcov is a member of the family coronaviridae genus coronavirus which is a group of enveloped and positive-stranded rna viruses antigenically and genetically coronaviruses are currently grouped into at least four groups fcov belongs to group i coronavirus which includes canine coronavirus ccov transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus and human coronavirus 229e wege et al 1982 two pathotypes of fcovs are also known one is feline enteric coronavirus fecv which causes from asymptomatic infection to severe enteritis and another is feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv that causes fatal immune-mediated disease fip pedersen 1987 pedersen et al 1981 it was demonstrated that fipv arises inside of cats by mutation from infected fecv vennema et al 1998 however it is difficult to distinguish between fecv and fipv by in vitro serological and genetical methods boyle et al 1984 fiscus and teramoto 1987 pedersen et al 1984 both fecv and fipv are divided into two types i and ii based on their neutralization reactivity with spike s protein-specific mabs fiscus and teramoto 1987 hohdatsu et al 1991b hohdatsu et al 1992 and sequence analysis of the s protein gene motokawa et al 1995 motokawa et al 1996 in addition to this serological property some other biological characteristics to each type have been described while fcov type i grows poorly in cell culture type ii can grow well in many different cell lines pedersen et al 1984 furthermore type ii fcov shows close antigenic and genetic relationship to ccov and tgev suggesting that fcov type ii arose from double recombination between fcov type i and ccov herrewegh et al 1998 fcov type ii strains are more frequently utilized than type i strains for in vitro experiments because of higher efficient growth for serological survey of fcov infection antibody has been detected by indirect fluorescent antibody assay ifa or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using fcov pedersen 1976 scott 1979 horzinek and osterhaus 1979 ishida et al 1987 alternatively ccov or tgev are also used as a target antigen because of serological close relations to fcov however discrimination ability specificity of these methods using heterologous antigens seems to be low since they detect also cross-reactive antibodies between types i and ii such as antibody to nucleocapsid n protein in this study we developed a plaque-reduction neutralization test prnt to serologically distinguish fcov type i and ii infections in cats and we applied it for field cases feline whole fetus cells fcwf-4 cells which are fetal feline lung cells having characteristics of macrophages jacobse-geels and horzinek 1983 were grown in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem containing 10 fetal calf serum fcs 100 uml penicillin and 100 gml streptomycin the cells were maintained in a humidified 5 co2 incubator at 37 c fipv type i strains c3663 and yayoi and fipv type ii strains kuk-hl and m91-267 were used in this study kuk-h strain was isolated from the spleen sample of effusive form fip case in 1987 by using crfk cells and kuk-hl was plaque-purified from the kuk-h strain mochizuki et al 1997 m91-267 strain was isolated from the spleen sample taken at the postmortem examination of effusive form fip case in 1991mochizuki et al 1997 these two strains were classified into type ii by using fcov type-specific mabs kindly provided by dr t hohdatsu hohdatsu et al 1991a hohdatsu et al 1991b c3663 strain was isolated from a cat with an effusive form of fip in 1994 and used as a reference fcov type i mochizuki et al 1997 in addition it was genetically confirmed that c3663 belongs to type i fcov and m91-267 and kuk-hl do to type ii manuscript in preparation yayoi strain was isolated from liver homogenate from non-effusive form of fip by serial passage in suckling mouse brain and then in fcwf-4 cells and have been used as japanese prototype strain of fcov type i hayashi et al 1981 c3663 kuk-hl and m91-267 strains were used in subsequent experiments within 10 passages in fcwf-4 cells although the passage history of yayoi strain is unknown it was propagated less than three times in our laboratory four sera nos14 were collected from cats clinically diagnosed as fip and serologically identified as type i infection by indirect immunofluorescent assay using unfixed fcwf-4 cells infected with fcov type i or ii on the other hand we could not obtain any sera from naturally fcov type ii infected cats therefore two sera collected from cats experimentally infected with m91-267 or kuk-hl were used in this study mochizuki et al 1997 to evaluate the seroprevalence of fcov types i and ii in japan sera were collected from 79 cats which visited to one veterinary hospital in 2004 and 2005 two of them were clinically and serologically diagnosed as fip in the hospital serological test was performed by prnt using serum samples inactivated by heating at 56 c for 30 min the sera diluted with dmem containing 2 fcs and each virus diluted to approximately 2  103
 pfuml with dmem containing 2 fcs were equally mixed and incubated at 37 c for 1 h then 50 l of the mixture was inoculated onto fcwf-4 cells monolayer in 24-well plate sumitomo bakelite japan after absorption at 37 c 1 h the inoculum was removed and 08 agarose seaplaque agarose takara japan in growth medium was overlaid the infected cells were incubated at 37 c until cytopathic effect cpe appeared fixed with phosphate-buffered formalin and stained with crystal violet when the number of plaques was less than 75 of those in control wells the diluted sera were judged to be positive for screening of cat sera all sera finally diluted to 110 were examined for prnt the positive sera were further diluted to 133 1100 1333 11000 13333 and 110000 to determine virus-neutralizing titers the titers were expressed as the highest serum dilution showing 75 plaque reduction or more to determine the antigenic relationship between fcov types i and ii serum samples from cats experimentally infected with fipv type ii m91-267 or kuk-hl and naturally infected with fipv type i were examined by prnt four sera from fipv type i infected cats showed vn titers to c3663 and yayoi ranging from 11000 to 116000 and those to m91-267 and kuk-hl ranging from 110 to 140 table 1
 sera collected from the experimentally fipv type ii infected cats had higher vn titers to type ii ranging from 14000 to 1128000 and lower vn titers to type i ranging from 180 to 11280 table 1 these results indicated that fcov-infected cat sera had significantly higher vn titers to homologous type but not to heterologous type therefore this prnt using both types of fcov must be able to distinguish serologically between fcov type i and ii infections a total of 79 cat sera collected in japan were examined for the prevalence of antibodies to fcov types i and ii by prnt using c3663 and m91-267 strains the result showed that 50 633 cats were seropositive to fcovfig 1
 among these seropositive samples 49 98 possessed significantly higher titers against type i and only one 2 did against type ii although three samples had vn titers of 133 to type ii two of them had higher vn titers to type i 13333 since one sample did not have vn titer to type i it was regarded as positive for type ii all two samples from fip cases had the highest vn titers to type i 110000 meanwhile these were negative 110 to type ii in this study we distinguished types of fcov which had infected cats by vn test at first we determined cross-reactivities of the known sera from fip cats table 1 vn titers difference between homologous type was five-fold or less and to heterologous type was 25-fold or more indicating that the present prnt can clearly differentiate fcov types it is known that a major difference between types i and ii is located in s protein responsible for eliciting vn antibodies fiscus and teramoto 1987 de groot et al 1989 corapi et al 1992 using the prnt we examined the recent status of fcov seroprevalence in field cats more than 60 of the cats were found to be fcov seropositive and this was similar to the positive rate described in other countries pedersen et al 1981 loeffler et al 1978 kummrow et al 2005 bell et al 2006 in japan hohdatsu et al 1992 first described that 213 of chronically diseased cats and 134 of non-diseased cats had antibodies to fcov by ifa to detect fcov infection the seroprevalence rate obtained in the present study is about three times higher than that in the previous report since different methods and samples were used for epidemiology it is impossible to directly compare the prevalence of fcov in japan however most probable explanation for this discrepancy is that fcov has been widespreading among japanese cat population during the last decade previous studies conducted in several countries including japan have revealed that 6991 of sero-positive cats were suspected to be type i infection hohdatsu et al 1992 vennema 1999 kummrow et al 2005 in the present study it was found that 49 cats 98 possessed type i specific antibodies and only one cat 2 to type ii the prevalence of type i infection revealed here was significantly higher than the previous report 804 in chronically diseased cats by competitive elisa hohdatsu et al 1992 although this and the previous report hohdatsu et al 1992 were different in methods and samples it might suggest that type ii fcov infection has been decreasing in japanese domestic cats in recent years in conclusion our newly established vn test can specifically detect and distinguish between types of fcov infection in addition fcov type i but not type ii has widely spread among cats population in japan  sars-cov-2 specific antibody responses in

to cause a human pandemic whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed serologic assays are still lacking yet urgently needed validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies here we developed serological assays for the detection of sars-cov-2 neutralizing spike-and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies using serum samples from patients with pcr-confirmed infections of sars-cov-2 other coronaviruses or other respiratory pathogenic infections we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial elisas we demonstrate that most pcrconfirmed sars-cov-2 infected individuals seroconverted as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house elisas we found that commercial s1 igg or iga elisas were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two with iga showing higher sensitivity overall the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies  in december 2019 a new coronavirus cov emerged in china to cause an acute respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 1  the virus was identified to be a betacoronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and thus was named sars-cov-2 2  in less than two decades this virus is the third known coronavirus to cross the species barrier and cause severe respiratory infections in humans following sars-cov in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome in 2012 yet with unprecedented spread compared to the earlier two due to the rapid rise in number of cases and uncontrolled and vast worldwide spread the who has declared sars-cov-2 a pandemic as of march 14th 2020 the virus has infected over 130000 individuals in 122 countries 37 of which had a fatal outcome 3  the rapid identification of the etiology and the sharing of the genetic sequence of the virus followed by international collaborative efforts initiated due to the emergence of sars-cov-2 have led to the rapid availability of real-time pcr diagnostic assays that support the case ascertainment and tracking of the outbreak 4  the availability of these has helped in patient detection and efforts to contain the virus however specific and validated serologic assays are still lacking at the moment and are urgently needed to understand the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 validated serologic assays are crucial for patient contact tracing identifying the viral reservoir hosts and for epidemiological studies epidemiological studies are urgently needed to help uncover the burden of disease in particular the rate of asymptomatic infections and to get better estimates on morbidity and mortality additionally these epidemiological studies can help reveal the extent of virus spread in households communities and specific settings which could help guide control measures serological assays are also needed for evaluation of the results of vaccine trials and development of therapeutic antibodies among the four coronavirus structural proteins the spike s and the nucleocapsid n are the main immunogens 5  here we describe development of serological assays for the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies and antibodies to the nucleocapsid n protein and various spike s domains including the s1 subunit and receptor binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 in elisa format using a wellcharacterized cohort of serum samples from pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 and patients pcr-confirmed to be infected with seasonal coronaviruses and other respiratory pathogens we validated and tested various antigens in different platforms developed in-house as well as a commercial platform serum samples

version 8 httpswwwgraphpadcom we evaluated sars-cov-2 specific antibody responses in severe and mild cases using serum samples collected at different times post-disease onset from three french pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients we tested sera for sars-cov-2 specific antibodies using different elisas following infections all three patients seroconverted between days 13 and 21 post onset of disease figure 1  and antibodies were elicited against the sars-cov-2 s and s1 subunit including the n-terminal s1 a  domain and the receptor binding domain rbd since the n protein of sars-cov-2 is 90 similar to that of sars-cov  table 2  we used sars-cov n as an antigen to test for sars-cov-2 n-directed antibodies in an elisa format we found that following infection antibodies were elicited against the n protein and when tested in a prnt assay these sera were able to neutralize sars-cov-2 we observed cross-reactivity with the sars-cov s and s1 proteins and to a lower extent with mers-cov s protein but not with the mers-cov s1 protein figure 1 g-h  this was evident from analyzing the degree of similarity of the different cov s protein domains to their corresponding sars-cov-2 proteins  table 2  where sars-cov showed high similarities in all different s domains the analysis showed that the spike s2 subunit is more conserved among covs and thus plays a role in the cross-reactivity seen when the whole s was used as an antigen thus s1 is a more specific than s as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serological diagnosis all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not

and sars-cov e infections none of the sera from specificity cohorts a-d were reactive in our in-house s1 elisa at the set cut-off indicating 100 specificity whereas sera from sars-cov patients cross-reacted figure 2a  additionally the specificity of s1 as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serology was further supported by the fact that 87-100  of the cohort a-c sera included in this study were seropositive for the endemic hcovs hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and -229e as determined by the s1 protein microarray figure 2b  nonetheless all were seronegative for sars-cov and mers-cov using the same cohort we also validated the specificity of the anti-nucleocapsid and anti-rbd igg elisas for detecting sars-cov-2 specific antibodies at the set cut-off except of sars-cov patient sera none of the control sera tested positive for anti-rbd nor antinucleocapsid antibodies figure 2 cd  whereas we detected seroconversion among the three covid-19 patients these validated elisas for different antigens can be useful for epidemiological studies as well as for evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responses next we validated the sensitivity and specificity of 2 commercial elisa kits for detecting s1-specific igg and iga antibodies using the same cohort table1 figure 3  all three covid-19 patients had reactive antibodies by both the igg 610 serum samples and iga 710 serum samples

time points pre-and post-oc43 infection while all pre-infection sera were negative all post-infection sera were reactive in both igg and iga based elisas we have earlier reported cross-reactivity of these sera in a mers-cov s1 igg elisa kit 6  further validation was also done in a different laboratory which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

recombinant immunofluorescence test and prnt 89 seroconverted patients showed reactivity above the implemented cut-off values in the igg and iga elisa one patient figure 4  black line maintained slightly below the cut-off which might be explained by an overall reduced antibody response of this patient prnt9010 overall the iga-based elisa kit was more sensitive but less specific than the igg based elisa kit finally we compared the performance of the different elisas for the detection of antibodies among pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients to that of prnt as the gold standard for cov serology  table 3  prnt50 correlated strongly with the different elisas with the commercial iga showing the strongest correlation followed by the s and n elisas indicating their capacity to detect sars-cov-2 specific antibodies however a larger patient cohort is needed to assess the sensitivity of these platforms validated sars-cov-2 serological assays are currently lacking yet urgently needed for contact tracing epidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies since the n and the s proteins are the main immunogenic cov proteins we developed elisa-based assays which were able to detect antibodies to these two proteins along with the two spike domains s1 a and rbd those correlated strongly with virus neutralizing antibodies detected by a prnt50 assay since the majority of the human population has antibodies against the four endemic human coronaviruses it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false positive results additionally the two zoonotic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov are also beta-coronaviruses raising potential for cross-reactivity among the spike protein antigens tested the s1 was more specific than s in detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies as mers-cov-s cross-reactive antibodies were detected in the serum of one of the covid-19 patients which was not seen when mers-cov s1 was used for testing this could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the cov s2 subunit relative to the s1  table 2  therefore consistent with our earlier findings for mers-cov serology 6 s1 is a specific antigen for sars-cov-2 diagnostics all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity when testing the specificity s1 or its rbd for detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies none of the sera form the validation cohorts a-e showed any reactivity except for sars-cov patients sera this -not-unexpected -cross-reactivity resulted from the high degree of similarity between the s1 and rbd of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2  table 2  however sars-cov has not circulated in the human population since 2003 ie 17 years ago and an earlier study reported waning of sars-cov-specific antibodies which made them undetectable in serum samples of 91 2123 of samples tested 6 years following infection 11  it is therefore unlikely that antibodies to this virus are present in the population and thus there could hardly be a chance that false positives result from sars-cov-antibodies reactivity meanwhile we made use of the high degree of similarity between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteins for the development of our inhouse n elisa where we used sars-cov n 90 similar to sars-cov-2 as an antigen the n-elisa could detect sars-cov-2-specific antibodies with high specificity and sensitivity using the three different validated elisas we found that antibody levels were higher following the severe infection compared to the mild ones similar findings has been reported earlier for mers-cov 12 13  however this needs to be confirmed with a larger cohort of patients with varying degrees of severity while it still highlights the potential need of a sensitive assay to avoid missing those with milder infections in epidemiological studies among the 3 inhouse elisas tested the rbd and n elisas were more sensitive than s1 elisa in detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and showed stronger correlation with prnt50 titers therefore detecting antibodies against two different antigens might be needed to confirm the findings and avoid false negatives in surveillance studies however the sensitivities of the assays need to be further validated with a larger cohort we further validated beta-versions of an iga and an igg s1 commercial elisa in two different labs while the iga-based elisa showed higher sensitivity than the igg-based elisa the opposite was true for the specificity where the igg elisa was more specific than the iga elisa yet we noted some cross reactivity in both elisas with serum samples from the same two hcov-oc43 patients that cross reacted in a mers-cov s1 igg elisa 6 despite the different antigen coated this indicates a response to another protein which could be in the blocking or coating matrix apart from the specific antigen coated resulting in this consistent false

various studies will be carried out in different labs it is crucial to calibrate and standardize assays developed by different labs using well defined standard references as a part of diagnostic assay validation this is not only needed to reduce interassay variability but to also harmonize the results obtained from different labs using various assays 14  this is crucial for better comparison and interpertaion of results from different studies as well as evaluation of vaccine trials allowing for uniform assessment of immunogenicity efficacy and better understanding of correlates of immune

first confirmed case of a new severe respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus was reported 1 2 the patient was a previously healthy male 60 years old who lived in saudi arabia and died of acute respiratory illness and renal failure 1 retrospective analysis of stored samples revealed that the novel coronavirus was also the cause of a severe respiratory disease cluster involving patients and health care professionals in jordan earlier that year 3 the isolation of the new virus from the saudi patients specimen and subsequent sequencing and detailed phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome has revealed its close relationship with bat beta-coronaviruses previously found in asia europe and africa 1 4 5 6 7 whether this emerging hcov jumped from bats directly to humans or through other animals as intermediate hosts is still unknown although the latter scenario is considered to be most likely 2 the presence of mers-cov neutralising antibodies has been detected in dromedary camels in spain oman and egypt indicating a past infection with mers-cov or a highly related virus in these camelids 8 9 the evolutionary history of coronaviruses shows evidence of recent interspecies jumps 10 11 one of the first described human coronaviruses oc43 shares a common recent ancestral history with bovine coronaviruses suggesting these viruses may have emerged from animals as well 10 in 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged and was the first known major outbreak caused by a coronavirus 12 now the emergence of mers-cov and its high fatality rate has triggered new concerns about the potential for a widespread possibly global outbreak challenges for public health are to develop strategies to control this emerging disease which include early detection of cases for with laboratory diagnosis is of crucial importance in outbreak situations especially with a novel organism causing severe human disease it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease as well as how this relates to infectivity the ability to transmit the microorganism eg virus and outcomes of laboratory tests laboratory response during the early stages of an outbreak therefore focuses on development of virologicalmicrobiological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis for contact tracing and for epidemiological studies into sources modes of transmission identification of risk groups screening of potential animal reservoirs etc however optimal use of this core laboratory capacity requires embedding of data needs for laboratory scientists within the outbreak investigations in order to obtain information needed for assay validation and correct interpretation of test outcomes following the discovery of mers-cov molecular detection methods and antibody detection assays were developed by several groups and deployed internationally through an international collaborative laboratory response 13 14 15 16 however in spite of the cutting-edge technological capacity eg deep sequencing microarray technology the lack of essential information eg time of sampling profile of viraemia and shedding linked to diverse clinical manifestations severely hampers the use of these techniques in the current outbreak here we review the current knowledge on mers-cov and other human coronaviruses against data required for optimal laboratory response for the mers-cov nasopharyngeal aspirates npa are the most common respiratory specimens described in the literature for molecular diagnosis of non-sars and sars coronaviruses 17 18 19 comparison of data between studies is difficult because specimen sampling is not standardised with descriptions varying from naso-pharyngeal swab naso-pharyngeal secretion throat swab nasal swab oro-nasal swab all reflecting upper respiratory tract sampling literature review shows that hcov viral loads peak at different time points during the progression of disease for non-sars cov eg hcov-nl63 peak viral loads are detected around day 12 after onset of disease with apparent clearance of infection over the course of 3 weeks in 50 of healthy children 17 20 21 for sars-cov viral loads gradually increase until day 10 6095 of patients after the onset of symptoms and then progressively decrease after day 13 4290 of patients 22 23 24 fig 1
 this comparison illustrates that even for viruses belonging to the same family using a sensitive test like rt-pcr the interpretation of a test outcome may be very different a negative reverse-transcriptase rt-pcr in a patient specimen collected early after illness onset for hcov-nl63 may be used as evidence for ruling out infection the same assay applied in an early specimen from a patient or contact with recent illness onset after sars-cov infection would most likely be false-negative as viral loads are expected to be low during this phase of illness for mers-cov data on respiratory shedding has only been reported anecdotally sofar all the mers-cov cases reportedly have developed a respiratory disease ranging from mild to severe pneumonia often accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards andor renal failure andor pericarditis andor disseminated intravascular coagulation dic clinical manifestations and severity of mers seem to be more similar to sars than other coronavirus infections however only one published report has provided data needed for laboratory preparedness ie on sequential sampling ct values and positive and negative test results 25 therefore at present viral shedding kinetics can only indirectly be derived fig 2a and b we plotted a timeline of available data on sampling and test outcome by day of onset symptoms for the mers-cov patients diagnosed in uk germany and france as well as some cases from saudi arabia the data suggests that shedding kinetics may be more similar to what has been observed for sars than for other human coronaviruses although very limited information is available for the latter fig 1 fig 2 the review also suggests that the use of upper respiratory specimens for mers-cov eg naso-pharyngeal swabs diagnosis may not be as sensitive as the use of lower respiratory tract specimens fig 2a and b in agreement with this viral loads were higher in samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract compared with upper respiratory tract in some mers-cov cases 25 26 the difficulty in interpretation of diagnostic test results is illustrated by two secondary cases in france and in the uk respectively fig 2a patients c2 and d2 both patients were sampled early after onset of symptoms the nps specimens were positive in the uk case and negative in the french case but sputum of the latter was positive for sars although most of the samples tested were npa lower respiratory tract specimens were more often pcr positive 76 than npa 45 or other upper respiratory tract samples 24 24 in sars diarrhoea was one of the most common extra-pulmonary manifestations in patients and a progressive viral load peaking around day 10 was found in 70100 of patients in stool specimens regardless respiratory symptoms fig 1 22 24 observations in children hospitalized for other hcov suggests that gastro-intestinal shedding is limited compared with sars although all four hcovs species have been detected in patient stools 32 however compared to sars there is less information about kinetics of shedding and viral loads in stools and respiratory samples although the major clinical manifestations presented by mers patients are associated with the respiratory tract gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea during the course of illness were also observed quite frequently 35 25 26 27 33 this triggers questions regarding the use of stools to diagnose mers-cov again availability of data is too limited for a comparative analysis with other coronaviruses in the uae patient who was first treated in an abu dhabi hospital on march 19 and later hospitalized in germany stool samples tested borderline positive at days 12 and 16 after the onset of symptoms fig 2a patient b later stool samples from patients f from ksa and g a patient transferred from qatar to the uk were negative by rt-pcr 25 28 31 whilst diarrhoea has been listed in the clinical picture for other cases including in two separate clusters in saudi arabia no testing has been undertaken 27 34 other mers patients specimens such as urine seraplasma samples and blood were very rarely tested not allowing consistent conclusions table 1
 the urine specimens tested were only from the patient transferred to germany were rt-pcr was positive on days 12 and 13 but not on day 14 after renal failure seraplasma samples collected from three patients late on disease progression 1620 days were all negative patients f c1 b rt-pcr done on blood of one french patient was positive 15 day establishing relevant cut-off values in tests should also take into consideration that patient groups differ with respect to age co-morbidities etc during the early stages of an outbreak investigation observations can be biased for severe disease in specific groups of patients eg older patients and with co-morbidities sofar the majority of reported mers cases have had underlying disease andor immunosuppression that could be an explanation for the higher case fatality rate 60 27 34 35 in addition delayed clearance of viral infection in such risk groups could be an alternative explanation for the prolonged shedding observed in the patients described fig 2b patients with co-morbidities more often have non-sars cov infections hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 compared with otherwise healthy patients and may shed virus for prolonged periods of time 36 37 38 39 in sars the clinical course among patients less than 12 years of age was milder and less aggressive when compared with adults and teenagers 40 41 kinetics of viral loads and the pattern of shedding can differ in these groups of patients and influence interpretation of diagnostic results while clinical surveillance captures the most severe patients outbreak containment requires a full understanding of the diversity in clinical presentations including mild or asymptomatic cases assessing shedding kinetics and immunological response in this group is notoriously difficult as it requires targeted studies and willingness of healthy persons to have samples taken without proper studies it is unclear if for instance asymptomatic persons can contribute to transmission there are considerably differences among respiratory viruses in the ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections for instance among children infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus usually are associated with clinical illness in contrast with non sars covs rhinovirus and human bocavirus that are commonly found in asymptomatic children as well 42 the literature on kinetics of antibodies in patients with sars-cov shows some conflicting results regarding the time of appearance of antibodies according to some reports sars-cov antibodies igg and igm are usually not detected within the first 7 days of illness but increase dramatically in the second week reaching peak igg levels within 30 days fig 1 43 44 similarly igm antibody levels increased up to 1 month and then declined gradually this profile has been observed with two different serological assays assuring that the detection levels of antibodies were not affected by sensitivity of the test other studies found specific antibodies igg igm and iga as early as 4 days after the onset of disease 45 46 igg and neutralising antibodies may persist in some patients up to 36 months although titres showed significant decline after four months 47 such data is important when planning serosurveys that may take several months to organise due to protocol design ethical clearance and planning of study logistics the presence of antibodies against sars-cov in individuals with no or mild symptoms has been described in healthcare workers 48 antibody levels measured in this study were highest for persons with severe illness indicating that different test cut-offs may be needed for the use of laboratory tests during public health investigations that aim to identify mild cases as well based on epidemiological investigations including serological assessment of the extent of transmission the conclusion was that only symptomatic patients were efficient spreaders of sars virus 49 for mers-cov some asymptomatic infections have recently been identified in health workers and children n
  8 but whether these persons can efficiently transmit infection remains unknown 50 51 antibody detection assays have been developed but their use has been limited a retrospective study has reported serological testing by immunofluorescence assay of 2400 serum samples from persons seeking medical care at fakeeh hospital in jeddah saudi arabia where the first case of mers was diagnosed in the two previous years 1 all these patients tested negative for mers-cov whereas a patient with confirmed mers-cov infection had a clear antibody response for igg 1 some authors have explained their lack of use of serology by the fact that assays are not yet validated 34 this argument seems flawed as the same could be argued for pcr assays that are used universally with the limitations described above serological testing confirmed infection in two mers-cov patients from abu dhabi and qatar hospitalized in germany both had high titres of antibodies by ifa that were also confirmed by neutralisation tests and by micro-array testing 16 25 30 interpretation of mers-cov serology can be hampered by the widespread circulation of the four common hcovs especially by hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 which belong to the same genus of the betacoronaviruses cross-reactive antibodies have been shown between sars-cov and other coronavirus depending also on specificity of the assay 52 53 according to the who guidance for health professionals patients should be evaluate for mers-cov infection if they develop pneumonia or pneumonitis and fever with a history of travel to or residence in the arabian peninsula in the 14 days before illness onset or contact with known confirmed or probable mers cases in the 14 days before illness onset 54 additionally the who recommends testing for novel coronavirus of persons including health care workers in clusters of acute respiratory infection of unknown aetiology requiring hospitalisation or where the respiratory infection is unexpectedly severe according to the mers case definition who revised on 3 july 2013 a confirmed case requires laboratory confirmation by molecular methods including a positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr on at least two specific genomic targets table 1 or a single positive target with sequencing on a second target 54 55 a single positive rrt-pcr without confirmation will be considered as inconclusive mers-cov laboratory test and such cases are classified as probable several molecular assays are now in widespread use and a two-step approach of screening and confirmation table 1 algorithms have been recommended by who and cdc 55 56 57 in both algorithms a screening pcr targeting a region upstream of the e gene is proposed sometimes combined with nucleocapsid n gene based pcr to enhance sensitivity for specimen screening 55 56 57 for confirmation a second assay with a different set of primers and probes is recommended table 1 serological assays for testing antibodies against mers coronavirus were developed by different laboratory experts and can be used for human diagnostics as well table 2
 however no official recommendations are currently available regarding serological tests and validation has been difficult because of limited availability of human convalescent sera according to the who case definition a person with an acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity with positive serological test it will be categorised as probable case of mers-cov infection 54 whenever possible a paired acute and convalescent sera should be tested ideally combined with molecular testing of respiratory samples as described above it is strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens are collected when possible in addition to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected the who also emphasises repeat testing as initial results may be negative specimens should be send to a reference laboratory for confirmation each probable or confirmed case of mers should be immediately communicated to the national health authorities additionally who requests that confirmed and probable cases be reported within 24 h of being classified as such through the regional contact point for international health regulations at the appropriate who regional office advances in laboratory techniques over the past decades have led to a continuous improvement of laboratory preparedness for emerging infectious diseases however the lack of sufficiently detailed data accompanying patient notifications and publications is an important constraint for developing evidence-based diagnostic support to outbreak investigations to gain a better understanding of the clinical significance and epidemiology of mers-cov it is imperative to collect detailed data on sampling laboratory analyses and results combined with clinical and epidemiological data in order to improve the quality of the laboratory support during outbreaks until full validation of laboratory assays has been done the combined use of molecular and serological approaches is highly recommended acute and convalescent serum samples should be collected from each patient to help define kinetics of seroconversion that will help to confirm or rule out infection in future patients avoid misdiagnosis false

in the last few months an unprecedented number of laboratory tests for covid-19 have been developed at a remarkable speed with the rapid adoption of these tests into clinical practice combined with the widespread publicity they received questions arose related to the different types of tests their utility performance and regulatory approval status the aim of this publication is to provide a general landscape of laboratory testing for covid-19 and offer a historical and regulatory perspective associated with them  amplification tests naat or by the detection of the viral protein for active infections subsequently we will provide an overview of serological tests that can aid not only in diagnosis but additionally help to identify prior infections and potential immunity with the emergence in late 2019 of the disease that was eventually named covid-19 now known to be caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 scientists quickly mobilized to develop tests that could aid in the diagnosis of the disease the virus rapidly spread across the world and as it did diagnostic testing took a center stage not only for the scientific community but for the world at large by the time the disease was classified as a pandemic the world perhaps like in no other time in history focused its attention and hope to diagnostic testing under such scrutiny it became apparent particularly in the us that testing needs were outpacing the availability of diagnostic tests to meet the urgency of the situation regulatory agencies and testing laboratoriesmanufacturers took on processes that cut the typical diagnostic development timeline as the process was streamlined an expansion of testing capabilities occurred however the fast pace at which these products made their way into patient care and disease surveillance necessitates a thorough understanding and review of the various platforms the development of tests related to covid-19 is evolving rapidly with new tests becoming available weekly in this review we aim to cover tests developed up to may 15 2020 under normal circumstances in the us a clinical lab medium to high complexity can deploy a laboratory developed test ldt when the test has received approval under the clinical laboratory improvements amendment clia provisions overseen by centers for medicaid and medicare services cms in this scenario the lab must demonstrate analytical validity of the test but not clinical validity a company which is looking to develop a clinical diagnostic device in vitro diagnostic ivd for widespread testing would have to seek approval from the food and drug administration fda under its regulated medical device oversight fda approval for novel ivds can be a lengthy process taking approximately a year for a premarket approval pma however when a public health emergency was declared by the secretary of health and this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved human services on february 4 2020 it gave the fda the authority to issue an emergency use authorization eua of in vitro diagnostics for detection andor diagnosis of the virus that causes covid-19 considering the rapid spread of the disease and insufficient testing capacity the fda issued several revisions to the eua policy in order to expedite the development of tests the first updated policy was published on february 29 2020 the revised policy enabled test developers seeking eua approval to begin running their test in medium to high complexity labs prior to approval however the test must be submitted to fda for eua within 15 days of the start of testing 1 with numbers continuing to the fda further amended the eua policy on march 16 2020  the new guidance set forth policies which allowed states more autonomy and test oversight as well as further details around eua process of serology tests 2 all of these changes were a significant step in expanding the us testing capacity however other challenges to supply chain have prevented the widespread adoption of testing that would enable greater viral surveillance 3 the fda continues to revise this policy and provide immediate online updates the latest revision prior to this publication was posted online on may 11 2020 4 it includes recommendations on the use of positives clinical samples for clinical validation and it incorporates the use of templates to facilitate the preparation submission and authorization of an eua nucleic acid amplification technology naat can be a highly sensitive and specific method to detect viral genomic material in various biological specimens real-time reverse-transcriptase pcr rt-pcr assays are a deployable and common naat and have been developed to detect sars-cov-2 rna in upper and lower respiratory specimens from suspected cases the specificity of the assay is mostly dependent on primer and probe sequence whereby the pcr primers and probe should have exceedingly better homology to the target sequence than other genomic material present in the sample ideally the target sequence should also have homology to all known circulating strains of the virus during the course of transmission it is possible that there is a shift in the target viral sequence whereby the sensitivity of the assay is compromised due to the alteration in viral genomic sequence in order to fully assess all of these considerations when developing a naat test the complete genomic sequence of the virus must be known by early january 2020 the complete sequence of a novel human coronavirus sars-cov-2 was submitted to the ncbi genbank online repository enabling researchers around the world to begin designing naat assays 5 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved the first rt-pcr assay deployed in the us was developed by the cdc table 1  the assay was originally designed to amplify three regions within the nucleocapsid n gene of sars-cov-2 the test was approved by the fda for eua on february 4 2020 and authorized to be run in labs designated by cdc and clia-certified us only to perform high complexity tests shortly thereafter labs running the test had begun to observe an issue the negative control reactions were yielding a positive signal the issue was not resolved until several weeks later on march 15 2020 the fda amended the eua authorization of the cdc 2019-ncov diagnostic panel to remove the n3 primer probe set identified as the root cause of the technical issue and provided additional information on assay reagents and quality control in the time between the distribution of the original cdc test and the amendment only 2 companies and 1 state healthcare system gained eua approval for testing 6 since march 15 2020 over 30 unique naat tests for the detection of sars-cov-2 have been developed which detect different regions of the viral genome table 1  along with the recent eua approvals the who also identified 2 tests for their emergency use listing eul procedure the genesig real-time pcr coronavirus covid-19 primerdesign and cobas sars-cov-2 qualitative assay roche 7 the eul initiative complies the different products in the market and assesses their quality and performance thus offering different countries and institutions an opportunity to more easily navigate through products that become rapidly marketed in addition to rt-pcr abbott has recently introduced a molecular point-of-care naat that uses isothermal amplification to identify the presence of sars-cov-2 in nasal nasopharyngeal and throat swabs idnow covid-19 8 isothermal amplification is capable of amplifying rna targets at a single temperature thus eliminating the need for more elaborate pcr machines which require multiple rounds of cycling at different temperatures due to this results can be reported in less than 15 minutes the analytical validation used contrived samples of purified viral rna spiked in to presumed negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix the lod was established at 125 genome equivalentsml inclusivity and crossreactivity were determined using only in silico analyses and found to have 100 specificity to all known strains of covid-19 and no predicted cross-reactivity with other common human pathogens or other coronaviruses subsequent to the development and eua approval of the idnow test in may 2020 fda provided updated submission templates for laboratories seeking eua approval specifically it is now recommended that a clinical evaluation be performed on 30 negative and 30 positive covid-19 specimens with the positive comparator assay being an already eua approved rt-pcr test as more clinical specimens this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved and tests become available laboratories can anticipate a more rigorous expectation of assay validation for eua approval traditionally both molecular tests and antigen tests can be used to diagnose active viral infections and the same applies for covid-19 the fda defines sars-cov-2 antigen tests as those that detect proteins that are part of the sars-cov-2 virus directly from clinical specimens 4 the fda recommends that the following validation studies be conducted for a sars-cov-2 antigen test limit of detectionanalytical sensitivity crossreactivityanalytical specificity microbial interference and clinical agreement study antigen tests detect the earliest traces of the virus rather than the genetic code of the virus itself naat based molecular diagnostic tests had the advantage that assays could be developed as soon as the viral rna sequence was published in early january 2020 the direct detection of viral protein using immunoassays however requires the generation of high-quality antibodies against relevant antigen protein which takes a few months in addition to assay development and validation time as of may 15 2020 there was only one sars antigen test gained eua by the fda 6  in contrast to the molecular diagnostic tests and antigen diagnostic tests which can detect current viral infections blood based serological diagnostic tests can inform on prior infections the fda defines sars-cov-2 serological tests as tests that identify antibodies eg igg igm to sars-cov-2 from clinical specimens 4 the fda recommends that the following validation studies be conducted for a sars-cov-2 serological assay cross-reactivityanalytical specificity class specificity and clinical agreement study unlike naat tests which solely rely on viral rna sequence the immunoassay based serological tests require knowledge to select capture antigen protein in general viral coat protein is selected owing to its ability to induce response from the immune system the sars-cov-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid protein are popular candidates as capture antigen protein the spike protein is expressed on the viral surface and mediates cellular entry through the ace2 cell surface receptor and therefore likely to elicit the highest neutralizing antibody response the nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant protein in coronaviruses involved in forming and maintaining highly ordered viral rna conformation suitable for replicating and transcribing the viral genome and is highly immunogenic as of may 15 2020 there were 12 qualitative sars-cov-2 serological tests that gained eua by the fda limited to clia-accredited laboratories table 2  6 some of these tests also received ce mark andor were approved in other countries such as uk globally many sars-cov-2 serological tests were ce marked andor approved in other countries such as china republic of korea singapore india brazil and australia in addition hundreds of non-approved tests were developed for research and surveillance use only with limited data disclosed on analytical and clinical validation 9 table 2 illustrates that among the 12 tests received fda eua 3 are lateral flow rapid tests 5 are high throughput elisa tests on analyzers and 4 are traditional elisa tests the 3 lateral flow tests are iggigm duplex tests whereas the 9 elisa tests are singleplex tests detecting either total antibodies or igg only to sars-cov-2 in general serum and plasma are the intended specimens in these tests except two elisa tests which were only authorized in serum under eua in addition fingerprick andor venipuncture whole blood are also the intended specimens in the 3 lateral flow tests the test tat is 15-20 minutes for lateral flow rapid tests 2-4 hours in general for traditional elisa tests and varies in between for high throughput elisa tests on analyzers interestingly among 10 tests whose capture antigen information were disclosed half of them used the spike protein as capture antigen whereas the other half used the nucleocapsid protein furthermore the selection of either the spike or nucleocapsid protein did not appear to influence test clinical this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved performance in general the eua authorized diagnostic tests have desirable performance characteristics with reported sensitivity and specificity ranging 87-100 and 94-100 respectively in contrast clinical performance for unauthorized serological tests has a different landscape due to urgency and critical public health need the revised policy issued by the fda on march 16 2020 allowed commercial manufacturer to develop and distribute tests prior to eua submission after false claims and accuracy problems among the 160 sars-cov-2 serological tests launched in the us the fda tightened rules on may 4 2020 and eventually issued the latest revised policy for covid-19 tests on may 11 2020 4 serological tests are being discussed daily in the media globally as they could play an essential role in assessing the prevalence of covid-19 and frequency of asymptomatic infection determining who may donate blood as a possible convalescent plasma therapy and could offer an insight into potential immunity which could help public policy makers lift the social distancing restrictions at this moment however it is unknown what percentage of the infected population develops an adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 whether they are neutralizing or protective and for how long antibodies may persist in the body after infection furthermore it is still not entirely clear whether an adaptive immune response translates into durable immunity in this regard who issued a warning on april 17 2020 stating there is no evidence serological tests can show whether a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming re-infected 10 regardless of this uncertainty there has been an emphasis on elucidating antibody response against sars-cov-2 on march 29 2020 the american enterprise institute issued a report national coronavirus response a road map to reopening 11 the first point in this report emphasized better data to identify areas of spread and the rate of exposure and immunity in the population in order to gradually move away from a reliance on physical distancing as our primary tool for controlling future spread globally discussions on the concept of immunity certificate eg immune passport was initiated shortly after the staying at home order was issued in multiple countries 12 italy and germany are pioneering surveillance studies to understand population immunity in the united states the first large-scale community based

15000 tested individuals has covid-19 antibodies 14 as expected prevalence is highly region-specific across the state with 199 positive in new accepted article york city despite high prevalence of covid-19 antibodies in new york city questions remain around immunity on may 15 2020 boston officials released that among 750 asymptomatic individuals in some of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the ongoing pandemic 99 tested positive for antibodies and 26 tested positive for the virus 15 furthermore to expand the scope and time frame of an ongoing covid-19 antibody study of 36000 samples funded by the national institute of health on may 18 2020 the cdc announced the plan to launch a nationwide study in june or july of up to 325000 individuals in 25 metropolitan areas to track how covid-19 antibodies evolve over 18 months across the country 16 it is clear covid-19 immunity needs to be better understood before it can be used in shaping policy on social distancing furthermore a better understanding of the possibility of immune antibody-dependent enhancement and virus reactivation is also needed such as those reported in south korea 17 the clinical utility of antibodies to sars-cov-2 will be a subject of intense investigation in the near future and an area where well-characterized and highly performing serological assays can help a great deal it has been difficult to observe the spread of this disease and the devastation it bought to many aspects of society it has also been remarkable to observe how the scientific community mobilized research efforts from quickly identifying the pathogen and sequencing its genome to developing diagnostics tools to offering insights into the development of potential therapeutic interventions and vaccines despite shortcomings in the availability of diagnostics tools and initial quality of first-generation assays the field remains committed to overcoming these early challenges and implementing ready-available high quality diagnostics diagnostics will continue to play a critical role in every aspect of the disease from diagnosing new and prior infections to enhanced understanding disease spread to containment of disease transmission to insights into immunity and the enablement of therapeutic and vaccine development that will finally bring the pandemic under control the research and development of novel or improved diagnostic tests for covid-19 will undoubtedly continue to move at an incredible fast pace we recommend visiting the fda 6 and cdc 18 websites for the latest updates   serological analysis of new york

wuhan the capital city of chinas hubei providence were reported to be afflicted with a severe respiratory illness of unknown origin1 2 patients presented with symptoms that included high fever pneumonia dyspnea and respiratory failure the causative agent was identified to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus variant 2 sars-cov-2 the 7th coronavirus strain to infect humans to date3 and the clinical syndrome was designated coronavirus disease of 2019 covid19 the pathogenesis of covid19 is similar to previously documented respiratory distress syndromes caused by related coronaviruses including the 2005 sars coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers4 however the greater transmissibility of sars-cov-2 has enabled a swift global spread that has resulted in substantial mortality detection and tracking sars-cov-2 spread has been difficult moreover the spectrum of symptomatology observed in sars-cov-2 infection is wide ranging from asymptomatic and mild reminiscent of numerous seasonal infections including influenza and common cold viruses all the way to life-threatening respiratory failure that requires intensive care and invasive ventilation currently increased age and comorbidities are the factors most highly predictive of severe of covid19 disease5 the utility of serological tests to identify individuals who have acquired antibodies against sars-cov-2 is thus recognized as both an indication of the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 infection and potentially of immunity afforded to the seropositive individual3 68 seroconversion is determined by detection of antibodies that recognize sars-cov-2 antigens coronaviruses have 4 major structural proteins spike s protein including the s1 protein and receptor binding domain rbd nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein and envelope e protein9 previous studies of sars-cov and mers found the most immunogenic antigens are the s- and n-proteins10 and development of serological tests for sars-cov-2 antibodies has focused heavily on these viral proteins three major platforms of serological testing have been adopted 1 enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa 2 high-throughput serological assays htsa and 3 lateral flow assays lfa elisas offer wide flexibility for research laboratories to select virtually any antigen of interest and provide highly sensitive quantitative results htsas are more suitable for clinical laboratories and offer limited antigen diversity but allow high-throughput and sensitive semi-quantitative results lfas also offer limited antigen diversity but function with small volumes 20l of whole blood plasma or sera and allow rapid 15 minutes results at the point of care the clinical community will undoubtedly employ multiple sars-cov-2 serology platforms but a comparative analysis across platforms has not been undertaken further it is currently unknown whether the detection of antibodies that bind these proteins predicts neutralizing activity or protection against infection11 convalescent plasma cp transfusion has been recognized as a potential treatment for critically ill covid19 patients and the new york blood center nybc has led the first covid19 cp donation program in the united states using 370 unique cp donor samples deposited in our covid19 research repository httpsnybcorgcovid19repository we conducted elisa hsta and lfa assays as well as sars-cov-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays we find that cp donors have a wide range of antibody titers measured across multiple covid19 serological and neutralization assays notably we show that some htsa and elisa assays predict neutralizing activity in vitro and may thus serve to predict antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vivo serological analysis of the cp donors was performed using 370 unique samples collected between april and may of 2020 from the nyc area cp donors enrolled in the program were required to have tested positive for sars-cov-2 by pcr diagnostic tests and be symptom free for at least 2 weeks cp donors had a median age of 41 years 95 ci 3944 range 1775 years and showed a gaussian distribution n183 r2089 compared to the national median age of 382 years in 2018 figure 1a the frequency of male and female cp donors was 452 and 548 respectively and was not statistically different from the national average of 492 and 508 figure 1b the frequency of aborh blood group antigens was also largely consistent with the national frequency with a slightly higher number of a and o donors and slightly lower number of ab and b donors than expected figure 1c finally cp donor ethnicity was largely consistent with the national ethnic composition with a slightly higher number of multiracialother donors and lower number of blackafrican american donors than expected figure 1d overall the composition of nyc cp donors analyzed was reflective of the united states population demographic neutralization assays measure how effectively donor plasma or serum can inhibit virus infection of target cells and are the gold standard for measuring the antiviral activity of antibodies in the case of sars-cov-2 such assays require in biosafety level 3 bsl-3 facilities and highly trained personnel to overcome this limitation and expedite testing we employed pseudotyped virus assays based on either hiv-1 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or vsv vesicular stomatitis virus both viruses were engineered to lack their own envelope glycoproteins and to express a luciferase reporter gene complementation in trans with the sars-cov-2 spike s protein results in the generation of pseudotyped virus particles that are dependent on the interaction between the s protein and its receptor ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for entry into cells12 these reporter viruses were used to measure infection of human cells engineered to express ace2 hiv-s assay or expressed endogenous ace2 vsv-s assay and to determine the ability of plasma dilutions to inhibit s-dependent virus entry the nt50 values reflecting the plasma dilution at which virus infection is reduced by 50 were calculated for each sample supplementary figure 1a the neutralizing activity of cp donor samples was extremely variable and nt50 values obtained ranged from 50 to over 20000 the median nt50 values were 3901 95 ci 27834997 and 4506 95 ci 36775384 for the hiv-s or vsv-s assays respectively figure 2a and the two assays showed a high degree of correlation supplementary figure 1bc fresh frozen plasma ffp samples donated in 2019 before the sars-cov-2 outbreak were used as negative controls n10 importantly the nt50 values of all ffp samples were 50 which is the highest concentration of plasma used in the neutralization assays and is hence designated as the signal cutoff sco value overall 831 and 927 of the cp donor samples had detectable neutralization activity using hiv-s and vsv-s assays respectively figure 2b notably 112 and 87 of cp donors had nt50 values at or greater than 2000 40-fold over sco using hiv-s and vsv-s assays respectively while 558 and 52 of cp donors had nt50 values at or less than 500 10-fold over sco figure 2b thus the majority of cp donors may have relatively modest neutralizing activity and a small proportion of donors have high neutralization activity nt50 values were not statistically different between blood groups figure 2e supplementary figure 1g or age groups figure 2c supplementary figure 1e and there was no linear correlation of nt50 values with age supplementary figure 1d in contrast to previous reports13 however in agreement with recent studies14 nt50 values of male cp donor samples were 17-fold higher than those from female cp donors using hiv-s and vsv-s assays figure 2d and supplementary figure 1f n  195 p  0009 and 0001 median difference 217 and 197 respectively for cp donors where symptom dates were reported the time between last symptom and the date of donation was calculated interestingly cp donors 23 weeks post symptoms had a statistically significant increase in nt50 values compared to cp donors 3 weeks post-symptom figure 2f and supplementary figure 1h n52 p  003 and 004 median difference 426 and 226 respectively overall these data suggest cp donors possess a wide range of neutralizing antibody levels that are proportionately distributed across demographic categories with the exception of a small sex-dependent effect multiple platforms have been deployed to detect seroconversion against sars-cov-2 the simplest tests are lfas which solubilize antibodies from whole blood plasma or sera in an aqueous mobile phase which moves across a nitrocellulose membrane coated with anti-human igg andor igm to distinguish between specific classes of immunoglobins while a control band ensures test function binding of antibodies to antigen-conjugated enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase generates a colored band at the test lines analysis of 144 cp donor samples showed that only 794 of cp donors tested positive for sars-cov-2-specfic igg antibodies and 248 for igm antibodies figure 3a top while lfas are not designed to perform quantitatively large discrepancies in band intensity between donors supplementary figure 2a is often presumed to indicate semi-quantitative results we performed densitometric analysis of the test bands from lfa cassettes supplementary figure 2b 2c and normalized each test to control band intensity lfas showed an intensity range of 0 - 992 for igg bands and 0 - 185 for igm bands with a median intensity of 20 for igg and 1 for igm figure 3a bottom thus lfas have a high degree of variation in band intensity within the cp donor population htsa systems offer the advantage of performing semi-quantitative seroconversion assays using clinical laboratory testing infrastructure at large scale we performed the ortho-clinical diagnostics vitros sars-cov-2 total ig assay and the abbott labs architect sars-cov-2 igg assay using over 300 cp donor plasma samples we found 964 and 914 of cp donor samples were positive using the ortho and abbott platforms respectively figure 3b the median value of cp samples using the ortho assay was 101 arbitrary units au n333 95 ci 785  123 sco  1 while that of ffp healthy controls was 001 au n8 95 ci 001  002 for the abbott assay the median value of cp samples was 604 au n315 95 ci 548  644 sco  14 while that of ffp healthy controls was 002 au 95 ci 001  015 these results clearly demonstrate a wide variation in antibody levels detected using htsa platforms in the cp donor population but greater sensitivity than lfa assays the gold standard for quantification of antigen-specific antibodies is elisa assays studies of antibody responses during sars-cov and mers outbreaks identified the s- and n-proteins as the dominant antigens therefore we designed three indirect elisa assays using sars-cov-2 recombinant his-tagged spike protein s1 domain s1 spike protein rbd domain rbd and nucleocapsid protein n we utilized monoclonal antibodies demonstrated to bind antigen in a dose-dependent manner to generate standard curves from which antibody concentrations were calculated and ffp from healthy controls to determine signal cutoffs these elisa assays showed that 852 891 and 963 of cp donor samples were positive for antibodies against s1 rbd and n antigens respectively figure 3c in the s1 elisa the median value for cp donor samples was 445gml n285 95 ci 342  536gml sco  120gml and for ffp controls 1009gml n10 95 ci 78  120gml in the np elisa the median value for cp donor samples was 6432gml n271 95 ci 2811  13792gml sco  700gml while in the rbd elisa the median value of cp donor samples was 156gml n43 95 ci 1255  256gml sco  4gml notably the range of s1 and np-binding antibody concentrations observed in the elisas was extreme constituting a 1000-fold difference in titers within the cp donor population taken together these data demonstrate that cp donors have a wide range of concentrations of antibodies specific to immunogenic sars-cov-2 antigens as measured across multiple serological platforms it is not logistically feasible to implement neutralization assays as a measurement of antiviral antibodies at a scale of the general population while quantification of seroconversion is practiced controlled studies that determine the relationship between quantitative sars-cov-2 serology test results and neutralizing activity is sparse we examined the correlation between serology and neutralization assays in the cp donor samples figure 4a supplementary figure 3 4c as expected s1 elisa titers showed a significant linear correlation with nt50 values r2  035 while the rbd elisa titers showed slightly higher linearity r2  042 commensurate with the fact that the rbd is a key target for neutralizing antibodies conversely np elisa titers showed a comparatively low degree of linear correlation with neutralization activity r2  009 by comparison the ortho htsa total ig assay correlated well r2  044 while the abbott htsa igg assay correlated less with neutralization activity r2  024 lfa igg densitometry measurements showed the poorest correlation with neutralization activity r2  022 correlation between serological results and neutralization activity was also examined using the non-parametric spearman test that does not assume linear dependence figure 4b as expected a high correlation between the hiv-s and vsv-s neutralization assays was obtained r089 the ortho and abbott htsa platforms exhibited the highest degree of correlation with neutralization among the serology assays tested r  075 and 072 respectively for the hiv-s assay 070 and 069 for the vsv-s assay the s1 rbd and np elisas also showed a high degree of correlation particularly with the hiv-s neutralization assay r  069 065 and 065 while the lfa igg and igm assay showed the poorest correlation r  056 041 taken together the data demonstrate that all quantitative serological assays correlate to some degree with neutralization activity however the htsa and s1 elisa assays have the highest predictive value as a surrogate for pseudovirus neutralization assays importantly correlation between htsa scores and nt50 values suggest presumptive ranges of neutralizing activity based on ranges of htsa values figure 4c supplementary figure 4a while elisa assays revealed s1 and n antibody titers correlated with each other these titers were not always proportional among cp donor samples to examine the coincidence of s1 and np antibody titers and using ffp plasma samples as negative controls we categorized s1 and n antibody titers that fell below sco values as negative and titers greater 10-fold over sco as high supplementary figure 4b using 241 cp donor samples that were assayed with both the s1 and n elisa assays we found that 81 of donors were double positive dp while 16 of samples were single positive 14 n and 2 s1 respectively figure 4d only 25 of cp donors were double negative for s1 and np antibodies within the double positive population we found that 23 of samples were dphigh while 5 and 30 of samples were either s1high or nhigh while the remaining 42 were dplow we then examined the distribution of nt50 values from the hiv-s neutralization assay within these populations figure 4e notably dn samples showed nt50 values at the sco observed for ffp healthy control samples while dplow samples had relatively low nt50 values median value 327 95 ci 186  444 importantly the dphigh donors had nt50 values that were 7-fold higher than dplow donors median value 2130 additionally nt50 values in the the nhigh and s1high groups were 25- and 4-fold higher than those of the dplow group finally we sought to determine if the frequency of peripheral blood immune cells varied as a function of antibody titer we stained peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs isolated from cp donor buffy coats for classical surface markers associated with b-cell or t-cell populations supplementary figure 5a 5b while we found statistically significant differences in nave cd4 and cd8 t-cell populations in donors with high s1 elisa titers compared to those with low titer we did not observe substantial differences in b or t cell populations that could plausibly explain the large differences in antibody titers or neutralization activity that was observed in cp donors supplementary figure 5c quantification of antiviral antibodies in recovered individuals is an important metric for determining population immunity conferred by exposure to sars-cov-2 our study suggests that most new york city convalescent plasma donors have antibodies against sars-cov-2 indeed our data demonstrate that the htsa including the ortho and abbot assays which have received fda emergency use authorization are well suited to detect a wide range of antibody titers in the population and can detect antibodies in 964 and 9143 of recovered patients respectively lfas performed less well and individuals with low antibody titers scored weakly positive or negative in lfas such outcomes could be interpreted incorrectly thus increasing the rate of false negative results ultimately studies that accurately document sars-cov-2 seroprevalence in diverse populations will require highly sensitive high quality assays such as hsta or elisa to be reliable our results are consistent with previous publications that show a considerable range in antibody titers in recovered covid19 patients15 however our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the correlation of quantitative serological test values with neutralization activity importantly high dynamic range serological assays such as the htsa and s1 elisa had a significant linear correlation with neutralization activity this knowledge is necessary for deriving potential serologic correlates of protection16 and may aid in predicting immunity at the individual and population levels14 however the levels of plasma neutralizing activity required to prevent sars-cov-2 re-infection are currently unknown indeed anecdotal results have been reported for seasonal coronavirus experimental infection studies for example one study of 229e hcov found a positive correlation between pre-infection antibody titer and neutralization activity with symptom clinical severity17 in another study 7 of 8 individuals with low neutralizing titers excreted virus upon re-exposure compared to only 1 of 4 subjects with higher titers18 however the conclusions of these studies are not directly comparable to the current sars-cov-2 pandemic as such the necessity of human epidemiological or vaccination studies are necessary to determine the minimum threshold of neutralizing activity necessary to prevent sars-cov-2 re-infection conversely sub-neutralizing antibody levels have been reported to facilitate rather than inhibit viral entry of the some coronaviruses in vitro through antibody dependent enhancement ade1921 while ade dependent replication has not been demonstrated to occur in sars-cov viral uptake into macrophages via antibody association with fc receptors does induce il-6 and tnf cytokines which may promote inflammation and tissue damage22 insights gained from an accurate analysis of antibody levels and neutralization activity in sars-cov-2-infected individuals will help address these important questions and the corresponding health consequences a key biological question is what underlies the large variation in antibody titers neutralizing or otherwise observed in cp donors numerous variables including the effectiveness of innate immune reposes sars-cov-2 exposure dose anatomical site of initial infection and partial cross-reactive immunity conferred by prior seasonal coronavirus infection could all impart variation on the amount and dissemination of sars-cov-2 antigen variation in the exposure of the adaptive immune system to sars-cov-2 antigen would in turn likely impact the magnitude of immune responses our observation that the levels of antibody to n as well as s correlates with s-specific neutralizing titer suggests that quantitative differences in the overall adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 rather than intrinsic differences in the ability of individuals to mount neutralizing responses at least partly explains the large variation in neutralizing capacity of cp this notion is consistent with recent findings that all individuals examined generated very similar potent monoclonal sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies but at very different levels14 the development of efficacious vaccines against sars-cov-2 may be necessary for ending the covid19 pandemic clinical trials will undoubtedly include a battery of serological and neutralization assays in test subjects to assess candidate vaccine efficacy surrogate serology tests to neutralizing activity could help to rapidly inform as to the likely effectiveness as well as immunogenicity of vaccines against sars-cov-2 to this end real-time analyses using scalable htsa testing platforms is effectuate while future studies are conducted to more precisely measure in vivo neutralization activity finally the utility of convalescent plasma in the treatment of infection has been recognized since the turn of the 20th century23 cp transfusion is thought to be effective through passive immunization specifically the transfer of neutralizing antibodies from a recovered individual to another individual manifesting life-threatening symptoms24 25 previously cp therapy has been used to treat both sars and mers26 and currently can be rapidly deployed against sars-cov-2 while other therapies are under development27 nevertheless many questions remain regarding the optimal antibody levels necessary to treat patients at varying stages of covid19 disease accurate quantification using serological assays that predict neutralization activity may improve clinical outcomes through refinement of cp unit selection for patients of varying symptomatology in summary we demonstrate that htsa and s1 elisa assays show the strongest correlation with neutralization activity and may serve to predict the degree of antiviral antibody activity present in recovered patients or vaccine recipients huh75 cells were a gift from

httpswwweuroimmuncom and performed the assay according to the manufacturers protocol we detected optical density od at 450 nm and calculated a ratio of the reading of each sample to the reading of the calibrator included in the kit for each sample od ratio because the -version of the kit awaits validation and marking we determined an in-house cutoff value based on the mean background reactivity of all sars-cov-2negative serum samples in the study multiplied by 3 the od ratio was 09 for iga and 03 for igg we performed the in-house elisas by coating 96-well microtiter elisa plates with

diluted 1100 or 2-fold serially diluted for titers and incubated at 37c for 1 h antigen-specific antibodies were detected by using peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-human igg dako and 3355-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate the absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm and we set the cutoff value at 6 sd above the mean value for the negative cohort serum samples were previously tested for antibodies against s1 of different coronaviruses we used a protein microassay that has been described 6 we analyzed the correlations between antibody responses detected by different elisas and those detected by prnt which is the standard for coronavirus serologic analysis we used graphpad prism version 8 httpswwwgraphpadcom for this analysis we evaluated sars-cov-2specific antibody responses in severe and mild cases by using serum samples collected at different times postonset of disease from 3 pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients from france we tested serum samples for sars-cov-2specific antibodies by using different elisas after infection all 3 patients seroconverted between days 13 and 21 after onset of disease figure 1 and antibodies were elicited against the sars-cov-2 s s1 subunit and rbd but only 23 patients had detectable antibodies to the n-terminal s1a domain because the n protein of sars-cov-2 is 90 similar to that of sars-cov table 2 we used sars-cov n protein as an antigen to test for sars-cov-2 n proteindirected antibodies in an elisa format we found that antibodies were elicited against the n protein in all three patients when tested in a prnt serum samples from all three patients neutralized sars-cov-2 infection antibody responses detected by different assays correlated strongly with neutralizing antibody responses figure 2 we observed cross-reactivity with the sars-cov s and s1 proteins and to a lower extent with mers-cov s protein but not with the mers-cov s1 protein figure 1 panels g h this finding was evident from analyzing the degree of similarity of the different coronavirus s protein domains to their corresponding sars-cov-2 proteins table 2 this analysis showed that the s2 subunit is more conserved and thus plays a role in the cross-reactivity seen when the whole s was used as antigen thus s1 is more specific than s as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serologic diagnosis we further assessed the specificity of the s1 assay by using cohorts ae table 1 which were composed of serum samples from healthy blood donors a pcr-confirmed acute respiratory non-cov infections b acute-phase and convalescent-phase pcr-confirmed - and -hcov infections c pcr-confirmed mers-cov infections d and pcr-confirmed sars-cov infections e none of the serum samples from specificity cohorts ad were reactive in our in-house s1 elisa at the set cutoff value indicating 100 specificity whereas serum samples from sars-cov patients cross-reacted figure 3 panel a the specificity of s1 as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serologic analysis was further supported by the fact that 87100 of serum samples in cohorts ac included in this study were seropositive for endemic hcovs hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e as determined by the s1 protein microarray figure 3 panel b nonetheless all serum samples were seronegative for sars-cov and mers-cov using the same cohort we also validated the specificity of the n protein igg and rbd igg elisas for detecting sars-cov-2specific antibodies at the set cutoff except for serum samples from sars-cov patients none of the control serum samples was positive for rbd antibodies and 1 mers-covpositive serum sample was weakly positive for n protein antibodies figure 3 panels c d we also detected seroconversion among the 3 patients with covid-19 because serum samples from the 3 patients were collected at a limited number of time points it was difficult to accurately assess time for seroconversion to accurately assess time of seroconversion a larger number of longitudinal samples is needed overall these validated elisas for different antigens can be useful for epidemiologic studies and for evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responses next we validated the sensitivity and specificity of 2 commercial elisa kits for detecting s1-specific igg and iga by using the same cohort table 1 figure 4 all 3 covid-19 patients had reactive antibodies detected by the igg 610 serum samples and iga 710 serum samples elisas figure 4 we also detected reactivity of serum samples from the validation cohorts ad 11203 for iga and 8203 for igg elisas serum samples from 2 patients infected with hcov-oc43 a betacoronavirus were reactive in both igg and iga elisa kits we have reported the cross-reactivity of these serum samples in a mers-cov s1 igg elisa kit 6 we confirmed the cross-reactivity of the 2 serum samples by testing 12 serum samples from both patients that were collected at different time points pre-oc43 and post-oc43 infection although all preinfection serum samples were negative all postinfection serum samples were reactive in the igg and iga elisas  further validation was also made in a different laboratory by using 31 serum samples collected from 9 covid-19 patients in germany r wlfel et al unpub data httpsdoiorg1011012020030520030502 at different time points 323 days after disease onset a specificity cohort composed of 18 serum samples from persons infected with hcov 4 samples from persons infected with hcov-229e 3 from persons infected with hcov-hku1 4 from persons infected with hcov-nl63 and 7 from persons infected with hcov-oc43 and 3 serum samples from persons infected with mers-cov and 3 samples from persons infected with sars-cov whose samples were collected 456 days after onset of disease onset figure 5 all 9 covid-19 patients were previously confirmed to seroconvert at days 615 after onset of disease by use of a recombinant immunofluorescence test and prnt a total of 89 seroconverted patients showed reactivity above the implemented cutoff values in the igg and iga elisa a serum sample from 1 patient figure 5 panels a b had an antibody level slightly below the cutoff value which might be explained by an overall reduced antibody response of this patient prnt90  10 overall the iga-based elisa kit was more sensitive but less specific than the igg-based elisa kit finally we compared the performance of different elisas for detection of antibodies among pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients with that of prnt which is the standard for coronavirus serologic analysis tables 3 4 the prnt50 correlated strongly with different elisas the commercial iga elisa showed the strongest correlation followed by the s and n elisa which indicated their capacity to detect sars-cov-2specific antibodies however a larger patient cohort is needed to assess the sensitivities of these platforms validated sars-cov-2 serologic assays are urgently needed for contact tracing epidemiologic and vaccine evaluation studies because the n and s proteins are the main immunogenic coronavirus proteins we developed elisa-based assays that were able to detect antibodies to these 2 proteins and to the 2 s domains s1a and rbd results for these assays correlated strongly with results of the prnt50 because most humans have antibodies against the 4 endemic human coronaviruses it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false-positive results in addition the 2 zoonotic coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov are also betacoronaviruses increasing the potential for cross-reactivity among the s antigens tested s1 was more specific than s in detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies as mers-cov s cross-reactive antibodies were detected in serum of 1 of the covid-19 patients which was not seen when mers-cov s1 was used for testing this finding could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the coronavirus s2 subunit relative to s1 table 2 therefore consistent with our earlier findings for serologic analysis of mers-cov 6 s1 is a specific antigen for sars-cov-2 diagnostics when testing the specificity of s1 or its rbd for detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies none of the serum samples from the validation cohorts ae showed any reactivity except for serum samples from patients with sars-cov this finding is not unexpected because cross-reactivity resulted from the high degree of similarity between s1 and rbd of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 table 2 however sars-cov has not circulated in the human population since 2003 ie 17 years ago and an earlier study reported waning of sars-covspecific antibodies which made them undetectable in 21 91 of 23 serum samples tested 6 years after infection 11 it is therefore unlikely that antibodies to this virus are present in the population and thus it is unlikely that false-positives results are caused by reactivity of sars-cov antibodies we used the high degree of similarity between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteins to develop a new in-house n protein elisa in which we used sars-cov n protein 90 similar to sars-cov-2 n protein as antigen the n protein elisa could detect sars-cov-2specific antibodies with high specificity and sensitivity using the 3 different validated elisas we found that antibody levels were higher after severe infection than after mild infections similar findings have been reported earlier for mers-cov 1213 however this finding needs to be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients with various degrees of disease severity and it highlights the potential need for a sensitive assay to avoid missing persons who have milder infections in epidemiologic studies in addition igg seroconversion can be reliably confirmed in the second week after disease onset however because of the limited number of longitudinal serum samples from covid-19 patients tested by the in-house assays it was difficult to accurately assess time for seroconversion for this assessment a larger number of longitudinal samples is needed in the 3 in-house elisas tested the rbd and n protein elisas were more sensitive than s1 elisa in detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and showed stronger correlations with prnt50 titers therefore detecting antibodies against 2 different antigens might be needed to confirm the findings and avoid false-negative results in surveillance studies however the sensitivities of the assays need to be further validated with a larger cohort we validated -versions of iga and s1 igg commercial elisas in 2 different laboratories the iga-based elisa showed higher sensitivity than the igg-based elisa whereas the igg elisa showed higher specificity than the iga elisa although the iga and igg assays can be used for serologic diagnosis igg is longer lived 14 and thus is preferred for serosurveillance studies we observed some cross-reactivity in both elisas with serum samples from the same 2 hcov-oc43 patients in which these samples showed cross-reactivity in a mers-cov s1 igg elisa 6 despite the different antigen used this finding indicates a response to another protein that could be in the blocking or coating matrix apart from the specific antigen coated resulting in this consistent false-positive result overall the assays developed and validated in this study could be instrumental for patient contact tracing serosurveillance studies and vaccine evaluation studies however because various studies will be conducted in different laboratories it is crucial to calibrate and standardize assays developed by different laboratories by using well-defined standard references as part of diagnostic assay validation this standardization is not only needed to reduce interassay variability but to also correlate results obtained from different laboratories that use various assays 15 this correlation is crucial for better comparison and interpretation of results from different studies evaluating vaccine trials enabling uniform assessment of immunogenicity efficacy and better understanding of correlates of immune protection 16 thus setting up reference panels is a vital element in our preparedness approaches to emerging viruses

 the specificity calculated using the results from the spf hens without any treatments and those vaccinated with oil-adjuvanted vaccines was close to 99 moreover the elisa based on se and st antigens detected 96 0 29 and 20 of the hens infected with s agona s berta s virchow and s infantis respectively table 2
 using all the data the global sensitivity specificity ppv and npv were determined to be 911 950 897 and 957 respectively table 3
 out of the 43 flocks 18 were classified as free of any salmonella serovar among them 16 four flocks of laying hens and 12 flocks of breeding hens were found serologically negative during the whole surveillance period two flocks of breeding hens were serologically tested positive from the beginning of the animal economic life onefive positive out of 20 samples however neither the routine bacteriological samples nor the additional ones collected because of the discordance between bacteriological and serological results allowed us to detect any salmonella serovar out of the 43 flocks 18 were infected with serovars different from se and st table 4
 these flocks were infected with serovars sharing groups 1 and 2 or not groups 3 and 4 common somatic antigens with se or st four flocks were continually infected with s heidelberg or s agona both serovars belonging to the same serogroup as st and were serologically positive group 2 among the flocks infected with salmonella serovars which did not share any common somatic antigens with se or st the only three seropositive flocks group 4 were infected with s hadar 
s enteritidis was found in two flocks of breeding hens and two flocks of laying hens for the first breeder flock the bacteriological and serological results were negative until s enteritidis was found in the hatchery where the eggs of this flock were incubated after examinations of organs from 60 hens s enteritidis was detected in a group of five organs consequently the hens of this flock were prematurely slaughtered in accordance with the french legislation anonymous 1998 for the second breeder flock se was isolated only once on the environmental swab the other bacteriological and serological samples remained negative until the end of the economic life the two salmonella enteritidis infected laying hen flocks were related to human food poisoning these flocks were belatedly included in our study at 50 weeks of age this explains why serological examinations were only performed from that time whereas bacteriological results were available from 40 weeks of age table 5
 these two flocks were located on the same farm the first one was bacteriologically and serologically positive at 50 weeks of age the second flock was serologically negative but bacteriologically positive at 50 weeks but positive serological results were then detected at 56 weeks at the end of production bacteriological and serological results were concordant for both flocks 
s typhimurium was detected at the end of the economic life in three flocks of laying hens for two of them positive serological results were inconsistently detected table 6
 in experimental conditions this elisa showed a sensitivity greater than 90 calculated by use of sera obtained after inoculation of hens with se or st the level of the serological response was correlated to the inoculation dose the specificity of this serological method was 95 in experimental conditions but decreased to 75 in the field study indeed out of the 36 flocks without se or st nine were seropositive so this elisa was not specific for se or st as sera from conventional animals raised in batteries and in contact with various serovars were found positive some of these serovars share common antigens with se or st like s agona and s heidelberg but others do not like s hadar differences in stimulation of the immune system may also be related to the invasive potential of each strain desmidt et al 1998 roy et al 2001 these three serovars isolated in our study from breeder flocks were also probably transmitted via the eggshells to the progeny in the hatchery indeed the owners of the breeder flocks infected with s heidelberg and s hadar involved in this study table 4 reported that the corresponding broiler flocks were frequently infected with the same serovars positive serological reactions may also be explained by the possible presence of se or st hidden by other serovars in the same sample as described by van winsen et al 1999 on artificially infected pigs the serovars agona heidelberg and hadar are not currently included in the french legislation although they have not the same importance as se and st in food poisoning outbreaks related to these three serovars are reported in different countries synnott et al 1998 bisbini et al 2000 van look et al 2000 lindqvist et al 2002 demczuk et al 2003 hennessy et al 2004 the two seropositive flocks with negative bacteriological results routine and additional examinations could be explained by a non-specific response of the elisa or a possible antimicrobial treatment desmidt et al 1996 feld et al 2000 in flocks infected with se or st the bacteriological examination was found positive before the elisa the difference was probably related to the delay in the transmission of salmonella within the flock and the immune response of the birds skov et al 2002 this phenomenon was particularly observed for one of the laying hen flocks infected with se table 5 flock 2 se was also recovered in two flocks of breeding hens but apparently without massive infection of the birds since the serological results in these two flocks were always negative in one of the flocks infected with st table 6 flock 1 there were several consecutive positive bacteriological results but only one positive serological result in this flock st was probably established in the environment without a large infection of the hens at the time of slaughtering with regards to the second flock infected with st the absence of positive serological results could be explained by the slaughtering of the hens before the infection of birds occurred in the third flock the serology became positive 1 month after the first detection of st by bacteriological method this result could not be confirmed because the flock reached the end of its economic life and the hens had to be slaughtered on a national basis the use of this elisa for the detection of flocks recently infected with salmonella could not be recommended indeed it may induce a delayed elimination of positive flocks and so may contribute to food poisoning and environmental dissemination of salmonella nevertheless serology remains interesting to survey a large scale of poultry flocks because of its possible automation low cost and ability to detect chronic infections without salmonella excretion cooper et al 1989 hassan et al 1990 nicholas and cullen 1991 barrow 1992 barrow 1994 desmidt et al 1996 skov et al 2002 if a country decides to use a serological method in its surveillance system a positive response in a flock without any vaccination against salmonella will need further bacteriological examination this confirmation remains necessary because of a possible non-specific response of the elisa which may lead to an unjustified chicken slaughtering and an economic loss for the farmer the bacteriological confirmation is also necessary for epidemiological reasons skov et al 2002 and regulations enteritidis and typhimurium are currently the only two serovars targeted by the french authorities other serovars could be targeted since the european regulation 21602003 anonymous 2003 consequently the bacteriological examination is still more suitable than our elisa to follow the evolution of the legislation for a recent infection of chicken flocks with se and st the bacteriological method currently used in france seem to be

2019 covid-19 a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories molecular tests that detect viral rna and serological tests that detect anti-sars-cov-2 immunoglobulins reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr a molecular test is widely used as the reference standard for diagnosis of covid-19 however limitations include potential false negative results1
2 changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course3 and precarious availability of test materials4 serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to rt-pcr in the diagnosis of acute infection as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care a clear advantage of these tests over rt-pcr is that they can identify individuals previously infected by sars-cov-2 even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill as such serological tests could be deployed as surveillance tools to better understand the epidemiology of sars-cov-2 and potentially inform individual risk of future disease many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period including some marketed for use as rapid point-of-care tests the pace of development has however exceeded that of rigorous evaluation and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains5 we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for sars-cov-2 infection our objectives were to evaluate the quality of the available evidence to compare pooled sensitivities and specificities of different test methods and to identify study test and patient characteristics associated with test accuracy our systematic review and meta-analysis is reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines6 see supplementary file we searched ovid-medline for studies published in 2020 with no restrictions on language subject headingssubheadings when applicable combined with text words were used for the concepts of covid-19 or sars-cov-2 and serological tests the supplementary file provides the complete search strategy run on 6 april 2020 and repeated on 30 april 2020 to identify pre-peer reviewed preprints studies we searched the entire list of covid-19 preprints from medrxiv and biorxiv httpsconnectmedrxivorgrelatecontent181 initially on 4 april 2020 and again on 28 april 2020 we also considered articles referred by colleagues or identified in references of included studies eligible studies were randomised trials cohort or case-control studies and case series reporting the sensitivity or specificity or both of a serological test for covid-19 we excluded review articles editorials case reports modelling or economic studies articles with sample sizes less than five and studies that only reported analytical sensitivity ie dilutional identification of detection limits7 three investigators mb gt fak independently screened titles and abstracts and two mb gt independently screened full text papers we used a sensitive screening strategy at the title or abstract level wherein selection by a single reviewer was sufficient for a study to undergo full text review a third reviewer fak resolved disagreements between reviewers at the full text stage in the systematic review and meta-analyses we included studies when sensitivity or specificity or both of at least one covid-19 serological test was measured against a reference standard of viral culture or rt-pcr in our primary analysis we estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity by method of serological test we expected that accuracy would be associated with the immunoglobulin class being measured as is the case for other coronaviruses8

figure 2 summarises the quadas-2 assessment and supplementary figure s1 displays each of the 49 individual quadas-2 evaluations for the patient selection domain a high or unclear risk of bias was seen in 98 4849 of quadas-2 assessments mostly related to a case-control design and not using consecutive or random sampling for the index test domain 73 3649 of assessments concluded a high or unclear risk of bias because it was not clear whether the serological test was interpreted blind to the reference standard or whether the cut-off values for classifying results as positive negative or indeterminate were prespecified for lfias 18 of the quadas-2 assessments when test results are subjectively interpreted by a human reader eg appearance of a line a description of the number of readers and assessment of reliability were provided in 17 318 of assessments for the reference standard domain we judged the risk of bias as unclear in 94 4649 of assessments owing to inadequate details about specimens used for rt-pcr or use of specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs we also classified the risk as unclear if fewer than two rt-pcrs were used to rule out infection or if the number was not reported risk of bias from flow and timing was high or unclear in 67 3349 owing to missing information or results not stratified by the timing of sample collection in relation to symptom onset major applicability concerns for the index test were seen in 29 1449 of assessments mostly owing to lfia being performed in laboratories and not using point-of-care type specimens

51 all four studies were classified as high risk of bias from patient selection and unclear risk of bias from performance of the reference standard and three had high or unclear risk of bias in the domains of index test performance and flow and timing supplementary figure s1 sensitivity ranged from 931 to 986 and specificity from 933 to 100 
table 5 reports stratified meta-analyses for evaluating potential sources of heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity peer review was not associated with accuracy for elisas and lfias accuracy estimates at the sample level ie in studies when it was possible for patients to contribute more than one sample to the analysis were similar to estimates using only one sample for each patient for clias specificity was higher from studies reported at the sample level point estimates for pooled sensitivity and specificity were higher when both surface and nucleocapsid proteins were used although confidence intervals overlapped point estimates of pooled sensitivity were lower for commercial kits versus in-house assays for all three methods with the strongest difference seen for lfias where the sensitivity of commercial kits was 650 490 to 782 and that of non-commercial tests was 882 836 to 913 for all three test methods pooled specificity was high when measured in populations where covid-19 was not suspected regardless of whether the sampling had been done before or during the epidemic for both lfias and clias pooled specificity was lower among individuals with suspected covid-19 compared with other groups similar data were not available for elisas for lfias specificity was lower when estimated in individuals with other viral infections but this was not the case for elisas or clias 
table 6 shows pooled sensitivity stratified by the timing of sample collection in relation to symptom onset regardless of immunoglobulin class or test method pooled sensitivity was lowest in the first week of symptom onset and highest in the third week or later data on specificity stratified by timing were not available 
table 7 provides a summary of our main findings with examples of hypothetical testing outcomes for 1000 people undergoing serological testing in settings with a prevalence of sars-cov-2 ranging from 5 10 and 20 for example in a population with a true sars-cov-2 prevalence of 10 for every 1000 people tested with an lfia among those who had covid-19 66 will test positive and 34 will be incorrectly classified as uninfected among those without covid-19 869 will test negative and 31 will be incorrectly classified as having antibodies to sars-cov-2 the utility of a low cost rapid and accurate point-of-care test55 has spurred the development and marketing of several covid-19 lfia serological tests56 we found only two studies where lfia had been performed at the point of care the low sensitivity of lfia is of particular concern given that most studies used sample preparation steps that are likely to increase sensitivity compared with the use of whole blood as would be done at the point of care these observations argue against the use of lfia serological tests for covid-19 beyond research and evaluation purposes and support interim recommendations issued by the world health organization57
 cautious interpretation of specificity estimates is warranted for several reasons importantly few data were available from people who were tested because of suspected sars-cov-2 infection hence our overall pooled estimates might not be generalisable to people who need testing because of covid-19 symptoms for clias the lower specificity among people with suspected covid-19 could be a spurious finding from a false negative rt-pcr result given that the specificity for clias was high among people with confirmed other viral infections by contrast for lfias other viral infections could have contributed to the lower specificity in suspected covid-19 our time stratified analyses suggest that current serological tests for covid-19 have limited utility in the diagnosis of acute covid-19 for example of those tested for covid-19 within one week of symptom onset on average 44 to 87 will be falsely identified as not having infection and while sensitivity estimates were higher in the third week or later even at this time point we found important false negative rates for example in people with covid-19 who are tested three weeks after symptom onset elisa igg will misclassify 18 as not having been infected and lfia igg will misclassify 30 overall the poor performance of existing serological tests for covid-19 raises questions about the utility of using such methods for medical decision making particularly given time and effort required to do these tests and the challenging workloads many clinics are facing our findings should also give pause to governments that are contemplating the use of serological testsin particular point-of-care teststo issue immunity certificates or passports for example if an lfia is applied to a population with a true sars-cov-2 prevalence of 10 for every 1000 people tested 31 who never had covid-19 will be incorrectly told they are immune and 34 people who had covid-19 will be incorrectly told that they were never infected our review has several strengths we used sensitive search strategies and included pre-peer reviewed literature and although our use of studies published as preprints might be criticised we found that the peer reviewed literature also had biases moreover preprints have taken an unprecedented larger role58 in discussions and policy making around covid-19hence the importance of subjecting pre-peer reviewed literature to critical appraisal another strength of our review was that two independent reviewers systematically assessed potential sources of bias finally a second investigator verified all data extraction our study also has some limitations most importantly we compared pooled estimates between different study populations as such the possibility of confounding exists eg from differences in timing of sampling between studies explaining differences in sensitivity or specificity59 this approach was taken because few studies performed head-to-head comparisons we did not perform metaregression as many studies would have been excluded owing to limited reporting of covariates another limitation is that as we did not search embase we might have missed some published studies future studies to evaluate serological tests for covid-19 should be designed to overcome the major limitations of the existing evidence base this can be readily accomplished by adhering to the fundamentals of the design for diagnostic accuracy studies a well defined use-case ie specific purpose for which the test is being used consecutive sampling of the target population within the target use-case performance of the index test in a standardised and blinded manner using the same methods that will be applied in the specialty and ensuring the reference test is accurate performed on all participants and interpreted blind to the results of the index test to reduce the likelihood of misclassification the reference standard should consist of rt-pcr performed on at least two consecutive specimens and when feasible include viral cultures to reduce variability in estimates and enhance generalisability sensitivity and specificity should be stratified by setting outpatient versus in-patient severity of illness and the number of days elapsed since symptom onset in summary we have found major weaknesses in the evidence base for serological tests for covid-19 the evidence does not support the continued use of existing point-of-care serological tests for covid-19 while the scientific community should be lauded for the pace at which novel serological tests have been developed this review underscores the need for high quality clinical studies to evaluate these tools with international collaboration such studies could be rapidly conducted and provide less biased more precise and more generalisable information on which to base clinical and public health policy to alleviate the unprecedented global health emergency that is covid-19  community-wide outbreak of infection with a 229e-like coronavirus in tecumseh michigan joseph cavallaro j arnold monto s   laboratory school of public health university of michigan ann arbor michigan agent in a natural population the following report is a characterization of the outbreak cell culture tubes of human embryonic lung cell strain wi-38 were purchased from hem research inc maintenance medium consisted of eagles minimal essential medium mem supplemented with 2  inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin and 100 ug of streptomycin per ml virus coronavirus 229e purified by terminal dilution in human diploid cell strain wi-38 was received from dr dorothy hamre viral antigen employed in complement-fixation cf and neutralization tests was prepared in our laboratory in wi-38 cell culture either 32-oz bottles or tube cultures were inoculated with undiluted 229e virus and incubated for 34-38 hr at 33 c the harvested material was frozen and thawed 3 times for use in the cf test for use in neutralization tests the harvested cultures were frozen and thawed once fluids were pooled and centrifuged and the supernatant was employed as cf antigen or infective virus population surveillance and collection of specimens since november 1965 a system of continuous surveillance for respiratory infections has been in progress in tecumseh michigan the generalaim has been to describe the behavior of respiratory pathogens as they progress through the community this is accomplished by the isolation and identification of circulating agents together with the testing of sera collected at set time intervals the families studied were recruited randomly from among those families with children whose parents were under 45 years of age these families were followed for a period of 1 year during which time they were questioned weekly regarding the occurrence of respiratory illnesses specimens for microbial isolation were obtained when an illness was reported within 2 days of onset these specimens were inoculated into cell culture tubes of wi-38 rhesus monkey kidney and hl cells a human continuous cell line three blood specimens were collected from all family members each person was bled at the time of entering the study 6 months later and at the end of the year of surveillance sera were stored at -20 c blood specimens from children under 5 years of age were obtained by collection of capillary blood by finger prick on filter paper disks 11 12  disks were dried and stored at 4 c serologic tests neutralizing antibody was measured in tubes of wi-38 cell monolayers in all tests the amount of virus employed was 10-32 50 tissue culture infective doses tcid50 per 01 ml equal volumes of viral dilutions and serial 2-fold dilutions 14-132 of inactivated serum were incubated at room temperature for 90 min 02 ml of each of the mixtures was inoculated into each of 2 cell culture tubes tubes were incubated at 33 c on a roller drum and read at 2-day intervals until simultaneous titration of virus indicated maximum cytopathic effect cpe serum titers were calculated by the method of reed and muench 13  a complete series of 3 sera per person was run in the same test cf tests were performed by a microplate technique 4 units of antigen and 2 exact units of complement were used blood specimens were screened initially at a 1 4 dilution positive specimens were rerun in serial dilutions for confirmation of the presence of antibody and determination of the titer as with the neutralization test a complete series of 3 bloods per person was run in the same test for both procedures a significant rise in antibody was considered to have occurred if antibody developed at 1 4 dilution or greater when no antibody was detected in the initial serum of a pair at a 14 dilution serologic conversion if antibody was present in the initial serum of a pair a 4-fold increase in titer was required for significance when blood specimens were collected on filter paper disks at least 4 were obtained at one time from each person for the performance of the cf test eluates were prepared from dried disks by addition 05 ml of veronal-buffered saline to 2 disks placed in a disposable plastic syringe disks 273 were held overnight at 4 c eluate fluid was then expressed into a clean tube this eluate was considered to represent a 14 dilution and was tested for cf antibody as described above because of the small volumes of eluate fluid obtainable eluates were tested only for the presence of cf antibody serial blood specimens have been collected from all participants in the tecumseh study the serologic data obtained were used to define the behavior of different viruses as they pass through the community when the complement-fixing antigen for 229e virus became available testing of large numbers of these sera for 229e antibody was begun at first little antibody was found in the population but in 1967 the prevalence of antibody increased sharply a total of 1990 sera were tested by cf they had been collected from randomly selected individuals under surveillance in 1966 and 1967 and all 3 sera obtained from a single individual in the surveillance year were tested the schedule of serum collection had been designed by a system of random selection of families individuals bled in anyone month should therefore be as representative of the whole population as those bled in any other month results of the cf tests are shown in figure 1 the solid line is based upon the presence of cf antibody at a 1 4 dilution or greater of the sera positive for cf antibody 448 had a titer of greater than 1 4 the occurrence of cf antibody was less than 1 in sera collected from july to december 1966 in january 1967 the prevalence of cf antibody began to increase gradually and peaked in april approximately 15 of the sera collected in that month were found to have cf antibody the prevalence of cf antibody then declined sharply in sera collected in may and june with a moderate increase from july to september this increase probably does not represent a second wave but rather the tendency of infections to cluster in families who were bled at the same time thereafter thelevel approached that observed during the same period in 1966 these serologic data indicate that an outbreak of infections with 229e-like virus occurred during april 1967 in view of the usual delay in production of antibody an increased incidence of infection probably occurred also in march 1967 calculation of results in terms of actual rises in antibody titer produced the dotted line shown in figure 1  the time indicated for each paired serum was the time of collection of the second serum in the pair this is nearly identical with the curve of antibody prevalence because of the almost uniform absence of antibody in sera collected in 1966 the similarity also suggested that cf antibody is not of long duration for had cf antibody persisted in those infected in the spring of 1967 it would be expected to be present in the fall however it was not and instead of deviating the 2 curves remained virtually the same relative sensitivity of cf and neutralization tests the cf test was useful in timing the occurrence of the outbreak partly because of its apparent lack of persistence however its relative sensitivity in detecting infection was unknown it was therefore decided to use the neutralization test as an additional method for studying the effect of the infection in the community sera from all families in which members were bled in april 1967 and from approximately 40 of families with members bled in may through july 1967 were tested for neutralizing antibody for each individual a serum prior to the april to july period had been obtained so that rises in neutralizing as well as cf antibody could be identified specimens obtained by disks were not suitable for testing by neutralization results are presented in table 1 for purposes of comparison individuals were divided into 2 groups those from whom sera were collected in april and those from whom sera were obtained later for individuals with blood specimens collected in april a rise in titer of cf antibody a  c occurred in 20 210 of those tested while 23 individuals or 242  b  c showed a rise in neutralizing antibody titer this indicates that the cf test was almost as sensitive as the neutralization test during this period overall a total of 29 305 of those tested showed a rise in either cf or neutralizing antibody titer or both the cf test was much less sensitive in detecting infection in persons with serum collected in the period after april none showed a change only in titer of cf antibody a rise in cf antibody titer in conjunction with a rise in neutralizing antibody occurred in only 1 a  c of those tested however 25 individuals or 391  b  c showed a rise in titer of neutralizing antibody overall a total of 25 391  of those tested showed a rise in antibody titer therefore it again appears that cf antibody persists for a considerably shorter period than does neutralizing antibody since cf was almost useless in detecting infection in the period after april while it was nearly as sensitive as the neutralization test in the april period the cf test would be of value in screening a large number of sera collected shortly after suspected infections perhaps even in the absence of prior sera the neutralization test can be used for somewhat greater sensitivity when sera are collected immediately after an outbreak and as the only method to detect infection when they are collected later unlike the cf tests paired sera are always required to detect infection by neutralization the only difference between the specimens obtained in april and those obtained afterward was the time of collection of the sera not the population from which they were drawn combination of the total number of rises in antibody titer whether detected by cf or neutralization provides a serologic infection rate for the entire group sampled of the 159 sets of sera tested 54 340 showed a rise in titer thus indicating the large 275 impact that 229e-like infection had on the community age-specific occurrence of infection there is no knowledge of the behavior of 229e infection in various segments of a population in which all ages are represented therefore the serologic infection rates were calculated by age to determine if all segments were equally affected results for both cf and neutralization tests are given in figure 2  all sera under study had been tested by the cf test and the most complete picture of the distribution of infection among the population could be obtained by examining rises in titers of cf antibody the percentage of individuals showing a rise in titer increased gradually to age 15 the rate remained high in the 20-29-year-old group but declined and appeared to plateau in the over 30-year-old group the rates for rises in titer of neutralizing antibody in the sub-sample of families are much higher than those for cf because of the greater sensitivity of the test in the period following the outbreak for purposes of a side-by-side comparison a different scale has been used in the figure for the cf and neutralization results in the older age groups the pattern of the rates is similar to that obtained by cf even though the number of sera tested by neutralization was much less the only discrepancy probably related to these small numbers is in the over 40 age group which had the highest rate by neutralization but the third highest by cf these data indicate that all segments of the population showed serologic evidence of infection by a 229e-like virus young children were also infected though at a lower rate among those aged 1-4 years there were 3 instances of infection the youngest person showing a rise in cf antibody was one year old this observation is particularly noteworthy since infection with 229e virus has not been frequently documented in infants and young children aggregation of infection within families the role of the family unit in transmission of infection was studied by determination of the tendency of rises in antibody titer to cluster in households of the 38 families studied 26 684 were found by cf andor neutralization test to have at least one member who showed serological evidence of infection in 8 of these 26 families there  an important observation is that in 8 of the 9 families that had only one instance of infection the infected individuals were 15 years of age or older the older children and adults may thus serve as index cases and introduce infection into the family in these particular instances secondary spread failed to occur association of rises in antibody titer with illness individuals with significant rises in antibody titer whether detected by the large scale cf screening tests or by the neutralization tests were matched with individuals of the same age who showed no change in antibody titer matched controls had a serum specimen collected at the same time as the seropositive serum of the index individual the same serologic tests were performed on sera from controls as from index individuals of the 76 persons who had rises in either cf andor neutralizing antibody titer 14 could not be matched with appropriate controls and were excluded from further consideration based upon the cf antibody curve shown in figure 1  the occurrence of illnesses with any respiratory symptoms was compared during the 7-week period from february 26 to april 15 1967 the number of illnesses was determined on the basis of reports received during the weekly telephone surveillance for both the 62 index individuals and the 62 matched controls there were 434 person-weeks of observations index individuals had 42 illnesses in this period while controls had 23 most of the excess illnesses were upper respiratory in character although 42  did have symptoms of the lower respiratory tract including productive cough wheezing or pain on respiration the difference between index individuals and controls is statistically significant at the 5  level x 2  600 05  p  01 rates of respiratory illness in the index and control groups were not significantly different in the 7-week periods before and after february 26 to april 15 1967 the occurrence of multiple illnesses in a single individual did not affect the analysis therefore the infections identified serologically were related to actual clinical illnesses past infection in the community the outbreak in the spring of 1967 was rather abrupt in onset with little or no activity of a 229e-like virus in the previous months because of the persistence of neutralizing antibody it was possible to employ the neutralization test to obtain evidence of previous infection in the community therefore sera collected from july 1966 to december 1966 were tested to ascertain whether such prior infection had occurred results are shown in figure 3  neutralizing antibody was present at 1 4 dilution in each of the age groups tested with only the 5-9 group showing markedly lower prevalence hence the community had clearly experienced exposure to 229-like viruses prior to 1967 the antibody in the 5-9-year age group was detected in children 6 years of age or older infection of the community must therefore have occurred in 1961 or more recently investigation of respiratory infection in tecumseh was designed so that the behavior of respiratory pathogens could be determined in defined segments of the population of the total community both isolation and serologic methods were to be employed in detecting the agents isolation of infectious agents was intended to demonstrate their presence in the community but because of practical limitations of the technique was never expected to define the extent of infection for this purpose an extensive collection of sera on a routine basis was begun testing of the sera would give information on the impact of a particular agent on the community and its population this serologic approach was used to characterize the outbreak caused by a 229-like virus the virus was not actually isolated in tecumseh since its primary isolation requires cell lines that are sensitive specifically to this virus 1 8  because of the possibility that another coronavirus might have been responsible for the serologic findings in tecumseh it is of interest to examine the relationship of 229e to other members of this group  recent findings indicate that 229 virus is antigenically distinct from the known organ culture-grown coronaviruses the national institutes of health organ culture strains and the b814 strain 6 7 14  the 229 virus fails to react in cf and neutralization tests with immune animal sera prepared against the organ culture strains likewise sera of patients from whom the organ culture strains have been isolated do not show a cf response to 229 virus in addition no cross-relationship has been found to exist between 229e and the recognized animal coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus mhv and avian infectious bronchitis virus lbv 6 7 14  therefore it would appear that an antigenically similar or identical virus to coronavirus strain 229e was most likely responsible for the outbreak detected in tecumseh in 1967 this outbreak occurred at a time when 229e was isolated in chicago d hamre personal communication and washington dc 8  an occurrence that increases the likelihood that it was the infecting agent in tecumseh utilization of both the cf and neutralization tests provided new insights into the nature of antibody response to this viral infection the cf antibody response appeared to be of short duration while the neutralizing antibody appeared to persist for a longer period of time after infection presence of cf antibody at 14 dilution or greater even in the absence of an acute-phase serum can therefore be taken to indicate a recent infection the neutralization test can be used not only as a sensitive method for detecting recent infections but also as the only method for determining the past experience of an individual with this virus when the test was used for the latter purpose results from sera collected prior to the 1967 outbreak showed that much of the population had been infected previously previous studies of 229e viral infections have involved mainly college students adults in special occupational situations and hospitalized cases of lower respiratory disease 1 8 10  the outbreak in tecumseh provided the first opportunity to determine the effect of this virus on individuals of many ages living in their own family environment the results indicated that infection with this virus was common in all age groups of particular interest was the fact that young children were also infected although at a lower rate the lower rate may mean in part that the virus was acting as a poor antigen in children our data confirm the findings of bradburne et al 10 that such infection is possible during the first 5 years of life and suggest that this virus or group of viruses may be responsible for some of the respiratory illnesses of unknown etiology seen in this age group as expected infections spread preferentially within families there was suggestive evidence that the older children and adults cavallaro and m onto were responsible for the introduction of infection into the family however in a number of cases the infection did not spread to other family members this may be an explanation for the higher rates of infection found in the older children and adults on the basis of the observation that cf antibody to 229e remains elevated for only a short period the peak of antibody prevalence in april meant that the outbreak of infection must have occurred shortly before that time when the illnesses of persons with serologic evidence of infection were examined for the period from february 26 to april 15 1967 a significant difference in respiratory illnesses was found to have occurred in this group as compared with a control group one may conclude that a definite association existed between the 229e-like virus which elicited the antibody responses and the clinical illness seen in seropositive individuals these data confirm in a natural setting the etiologic relationship of 229e viral infection to respiratory illness this relation has been demonstrated previously only in studies of volunteers 2 10  this outbreak in tecumseh was widespread with 340 of the population tested showing serologic evidence of infection the sampling method employed in this study insured that this rate is a true representation of the impact of 229e virus infection in the community the agent must therefore be considered a major human pathogen there is no indication whether these findings for 229e-like infection would also apply to other human coronaviruses should other members exhibit a similar pattern of infection together they could be responsible for a significant portion of respiratory illnesses of man which up to now have been of unknown etiology the occurrence of 229b-like virus infection in a natural population was determined by a survey of sera collected from families in tecumseh michigan sera were studied by the complement fixation cf test and a sharp outbreak of 229elike virus infection was detected in the community in the spring of 1967 the serologic infection rate in a representative group of families as determined by the combined results of both the cf and neutralization tests was 340 during the periods studied all segments of the population were affected this virus tended to spread preferentially within families secondary cases were found in 17 of 26 families in which infection was detected in all but one of the families in which the virus was introduced but did not spread the single infection was in a person 15 years or older serologic evidence of infection was associated with an increased number of illnesses reported during february-april 1967 most of the illnesses were upper respiratory in character the determination of cf and neutralizing antibody responses to 229e-like infection suggests that cf antibody to this virus remains elevated and detectable for a relatively short period of time after infection while neutralizing antibody persists and remains detectable for a longer period of time than the cf antibody the cf test may thus be used to detect infection with 229e virus if it is performed on sera collected shortly after infection even in the absence of an acute-phase serum the neutralization test may be used both to detect recent 229e infections and to determine an individuals past experience with this virus

definition of the antigenic composition of the human coronaviruses has been limited by the small number of isolations so far reported 14 in tissue culture nine in organ culture and the inability to adapt most of the organ culture strains to more practical laboratory systems at least two immunotypes have so far been distinguished one consisting of 229e and all of the other strains derived from primary isolation in cell culture and the other of organ culture strains oc 38 and 43 7  the number of additional immunotypes represented by the remaining organ culture strains is as yet uncertain that human respiratory coronaviruses have the potential to be respiratory pathogens has been demonstrated in artificial challenge studies common colds have developed in significant numbers of volunteers inoculated with coronavirus strains b814 and 229e 2 8  however little is known about the extent and significance of infection with these viruses in naturally occurring acute respiratory illnesses the relatively complex methodology of organ culture systems limits the applicability of this technique to etiologic studies and although the primary isolation of 229e-like strains can be accomplished in cell culture this is usually quite difficult to do even so the isolation of multiple 229e-like strains from adults with acute respiratory illness has previously been reported on two occasions 1 9  and a third is described below the application of serologic techniques to the question of prevalence and significance of human respiratory coronavirus infections has been circumscribed by incomplete knowledge of the serologic interrelations of the group and the restriction of laboratory methods suitable for such studies to tissue culture strain 229e and organ culture strain oc 3843 antibody prevalence surveys indicate human infection with these andor related coronaviruses may be quite common 8 10 11  and serologic studies have sug-gested an etiologic role for both 229e 9 10 and oc 3843 9 12 in acute respiratory illness that was not selected on the basis of severity however in a study of acute lower respiratory disease of infants and children that necessitated hospitalization there was no complement fixing cf antibody evidence that infections with these viruses played a significant role 11  the following report of serologic and epidemiologic studies of 229e virus is based upon observations made in the course of a continuous surveillance of respiratory disease among medical students at the university of chicago during a six-year period between 1961 and 1968 it includes observations on 1 cf and neutralizing antibody responses to 229e of eight previously reported 1 and four additional individuals from whom 229e virus was isolated 2 the persistence of neutralizing and cf antibody in 12 other individuals in whom infection with this virus was diagnosed serologically 3 the occurrence of neutralizing andor cf antibody responses to 229e virus in the course of infection with other respiratory viruses 4 the overall occurrence during the six years of respiratory disease surveillance of cf antibody rises to 229e 5 the relationship between neutralizing and cf antibody

students participated in the program on a voluntary basis only students in the first two years of school were included during 1961 through 1963 after that students in their third and fourth years as well as a few who had gone on to internship and residency were included students reported to the laboratory at the first sign of an acute illness and secretions from the nose and throat were obtained on cotton swabs which were subsequently placed in collecting medium the first of two illness blood specimens were obtained at the time of the original visit and the second two to five weeks later at this time a brief form describing the symptoms and duration of illness was completed additional blood specimens and cultures were obtained from all participants at six-week intervals on a routine basis virus isolation over the several years of the study there were minor variations in the media and cell cultures employed for virus isolation throughout the study all specimens were inoculated into cell cultures of rhesus monkey kidney mk and hep-2 human kidney hk cell cultures were also employed routinely in 1961-1962 after this time human diploid fibroblasts hdf wi-38 or hel-1 a university of chicago strain were routinely employed and hk was only used periodically cell cultures inoculated with specimens and an appropriate number of controls were incubated at 36 c mk hep-2 or 33 c hk hdf stationary mk hep-2 or rolling hk hdf and observed at regular intenals over a 20-day period for the development of cytopathic changes cpe mk cultures were also tested for hemadsorption virus isolates were identified by neutralization of infectivity or hemadsorption inhibition employing appropriate antisera cf test bottles containing confluent hdf monolayers were drained of medium and inoculated with enough 229e virus to provide about one plaque forming unit per cell after a one hour absorption at 33 c enough maintenance medium eagles minimal essential medium with 1 per cent fetal calf serum was added to cover the monolayer and the bottles incubated until the first appearance of cpe could be detected about 36 to 48 hours later the bottles were then frozen and thawed three times and the debris removed by centrifugation the supernate was divided into small aliquots and refrozen for use as cf antigen the cf test was performed in microtiter plates essentially using the method of sever 15  antigen was titrated by the checkerboard method employing acute and convalescent sera of a student from whom the virus was isolated in 1961 two units of antigen were employed in the test along with two exact units of complement which had been titrated in the presence of antigen after overnight fixation at 4 c the hemolytic system was added and the plates incubated at 37 c for 30 minutes readings were made after the cells had settled in the refrigerator for three to four hours titers represent the highest dilution showing 3 to 4 fixation neutralization tests twofold dilutions of heat inactivated serum 56 c for 30 minutes were made in beef heart infusion broth and mixed with an equal volume of virus diluted to give 5-50 tcid 60 of virus per 02 ml of virus-serum mixture after incubation at room temperature for two hours three tubes of hdf were inoculated with 02 ml of each virus-serum mixture appropriate virus controls and titrations were included in each test to provide a concurrent determination of the actual tcid50 of virus used in the test final readings were made after three to five days of incubation on roller drums at 33 c when virus control tubes showed 3 to 4 cpe tubes showing any degree of cpe were considered positive and endpoint titers represent the highest dilution of serum neutralizing the virus dose indicated in parentheses in table 1 in at least two of the three inoculated cell cultures serologic neutralizing antibody was present in the pre-infection sera of eight of 12 students at titers of 12 to 116 of the four students without pre-infection antibody three had titers  18 and one was  14 post-infection eight of the 12 developed fourfold rises in titer with 164 the peak titer observed cf antibody was absent 14 from all pre-infection sera post-infection sera showed fourfold or better rises in seven of the 12 and an additional student had a twofold titer rise thus in this small experience two thirds of individuals with virus-shedding infections developed significant rises in either cf or neutralizing serum antibody titer the majority of the negative serologic responses of infection were contributed by three students who failed to develop either neutralizing or cf antibody titer rises and were alike in the additional respect that all were without pre-infection neutralizing antibody it was not possible to reconfirm these isolations because material was not available for reisolation attempts but it was determined that the strains of virus isolated from these students were antigenically similar to the prototype to the extent that they and the prototype strain were neutralized with equal efficiency by 229e hyperimmune guinea pig serum it was also determined that these students failed to develop a neutralizing antibody response to their own as well as the prototype strain of 229e in 12 other medical students 229e infection was identified by cf and neutralizing antibody seroconversion early in the course of their participation in this surveillance study serial serum specimens were available from them that extended over a two-to four-year period the persistence of anti- body observed in these students is summarized in table 2 considering neutralizing antibody first three of the 12 lacked antibody to 229e virus in the pre-rise serum while the remainder had titers ranging from 14 to 116 peak titers ranged from 116 to 1128 and 22 to 28 months later titers were still significantly higher than pre-rise levels in seven of the 12 students in contrast cf antibody titers were  14 in the initial sera of all 12 students rose to peak values of 14 to 116 and in all cases returned to  14 within one to nine months following peak values the persistence of neutralizing and evanescence of cf antibody to 229e implied by the common occurrence of neutralizing but not cf antibody in pre-infection sera of students is demonstrated in these data also the presence of neutralizing antibody in the preinfection sera of nine of these 12 students with seroconversion to 229e as well as eight of the 12 from whom virus was iso- information concerning the specificity of the serologic responses to 229e virus was sought by examining pre-and post-infection sera of students with virus shedding respiratory infections caused by other viruses cf and neutralizing antibody responses to 229e virus were determined following infection with rhinovirus 82 students herpesvirus 12 students respiratory syncytial rs virus 16 students influenza virus a2-two students b-10 students parainfluenza virus type 1-four students type 2-five students type 3-six students and adenovims type 1 one student  four increases of 229e cf antibody titer were observed two followed rhinovirus infections and one each infection with herpesviras and adenovirus with two of the cf rises herpesvirus-one rhinovirus -one there were concomitant increases in the titer of neutralizing antibody to 229e all rises took place during time periods of known 229e prevalence since these cf titer rises were few in number accompanied in two of the four instances by rises in neutralizing antibody titer and occurred during times when concomitant infection with 229e was possible these data are interpreted as showing little if any evidence of heterologous responses to 229e in the course of infection with the indicated respiratory viruses because the cytopathic changes of 229e in human diploid cell cultures are difficult to detect it seemed probable that a serologic test would better estimate the true incidence of infection in the medical student group for this cf tests were performed on all sera collected between november 1961 and may 1968 including both routine specimens collected at six-week intervals and acute and convalescent illness specimens in doing the cf tests it was found that almost all sera were completely nega- tive for complement fixation at the initial 14 dilution when in a series of specimens from one student a positive reaction was found at but not beyond this 14 dilution the immediately following sera also showed complement fixation that was at the same level or progressively declined through 2 or 1 and then became and remained completely negative it was decided therefore that cf titer changes from 14 t 14 that could be confirmed on repeat testing were serologically significant cf antibody titer rises and 229e isolations found in the entire group of students together with neutralizing antibody titer rises of students with cf seroconversions are presented in table 3 in the overall experience which encompassed 937 student years of observation 133 students with cf antibody titer rises were identified one or more students developed rises in each of the six seasons and the frequency of rises in any one season appeared to fall into one of two patterns high or low thus there were three high seasons with 15 to 35 per cent of students showing rises 1961-1962 -31 per cent 1963-1964-15 per cent 1966-1967-35 per cent and three low seasons with 1 to 5 per cent showing rises 1962-1963-5 per cent 1964-1965-1 per cent 1965-1966-3 per cent the high frequency seasons did not occur consecutively but were separated by one or two low frequency seasons high and low frequency seasons also differed in respect to the portion of the observed cf rises that were 2x 14 to 14 and 4x 14 to sl8 in high frequency seasons both 2x and 4x rises occurred with the latter comprising 76 48 and 74 per cent of cf rises in the 1961-1962 1963-1964 and 1966-1967 seasons respectively and 64 per cent 85133 of all cf rises observed in low frequency seasons only 2x rises were seen and in this respect low frequency seasons differed significantly from high frequency seasons p  001 although cf cross-reactions between 229e and other viruses have not been described the specificity of this test is uncertain therefore neutralization tests were also done on the sera of students with cf rises of the 133 students with cf rises 66 50 per cent had concomitant neutralizing antibody rises the portion of students with neutralizing antibody rises showed a direct relation to the extent of cf antibody rise table 4 being 35 per cent of 48 students with 2x cf rises 45 per cent for 53 students with 4x rises and 78 per cent of 32 students with 8x rises among students with 2x cf rises concomitant neutralizing antibody rises occurred less often in low than in high frequency years 312 vs 1436 but the serologic findings in the students from whom 229e virus was isolated indicated that the immune state characterized by serum neutralizing antibody to this virus did not preclude natural reinfection other serologic evidence supported this in the 1966-1967 season pre-infection neutralizing antibody titers 14 were found in 62 94 per cent of 66 students with cf seroconversion and in 28 85 per cent of 33 students with neutralizing antibody seroconversion in the other five seasons of surveillance of 67 students with cf seroconversion 46 69 per cent had pre-rise neutralizing antibody titers 518 to determine how reinfection was related to the level of neutralizing antibody neutralizing and cf antibody seroconversion rates were determined for the 189 students of the 1966-1967 season according to the level of neutralizing antibody found in their november 1966 serum specimen table 6  a distinctly different relationship was found between the preinfection neutralizing antibody level and the frequency of seroconversion as determined by the two tests the frequency of neutralizing antibody seroconversion was inversely related to the level of neutralizing antibody in the november serum p  005 while cf seroconversion occurred with similar frequency irrespective of neutralizing antibody in the november serum strictly comparable data were not available for other years of the study when neutralization tests were only done on sera of students with cf titer rises however among those students with cf seroconversion a significant p  01 inverse relation between initial neutralizing antibody titer and frequency of significant rise of neutralizing antibody was again seen  the multiple serum specimens from the 133 students with cf seroconversions spanned a total of 909 time periods of known health status that could be divided according to the presence or absence of acute respiratory illness into illness periods and wellness periods cf seroconversion to 229e occurred with a significantly greater frequency during illness periods than during wellness periods 75 seroconversions245 illness periods vs 58664 wellness periods p  001 as cited above cf seroconversion rates to 229e were not related to presence or absence of homologous neutralizing antibody in sera obtained prior to the time of the cf antibody titer rise it was also found that the level of neutralizing antibody did not clearly influence the likelihood that illness would accompany cf seroconversion there was illness during the period of cf seroconversion in 67 per cent of 49 students with initial neutralizing antibody titers  18 as compared to 50 per cent of 84 students with initial neutralizing antibody titers 18 p  05  10 also cf seroconversions were illness associated with equal frequency among students with and without concomitant neutralizing antibody titer rises 60 per cent vs 52 per cent p  3  5 the clinical characteristics of these respiratory illnesses were not distinctive symptoms reported by students during illnesses 2t associated with cf antibody titer rises to this virus were those of undifferentiated acute respiratory infections and did not differ significantly from those reported by these and other students during respiratory infections caused by rhino rs or parainfluenza viruses the seasonal pattern of 229e infections as evidenced by virus isolation and cf antibody titer rises is presented in table 8 in each of the six seasons of surveillance virus isolations and cf seroconversions occurred almost exclusively in the winter and spring months the exception being 1966-1967 when cf rises were seen in october november and june if allowance is made for the time interval by which positive serum specimens post dated the time of infection two weeks with illness specimens and longer with routine specimens most infections occurred during the months of december through april discussion certain conclusions seem clear from the observations based on virus isolation and neutralizing antibody seroconversion infection with 229e virus was far from uncommon and significantly related to acute respiratory illness infection occurred in a winter-spring seasonal pattern similar to that reported previously 9 11 while the pattern of prevalence over successive years suggested this agent might circulate annually in urban populations with seasons of accentuated prevalence at two-to three-year intervals infection was associated with acute respiratory illness clinically indistinguishable from that caused by other common respiratory viruses and serologically followed by persistently elevated neutralizing and transiently elevated cf antibody titers reinfection with 229e appeared to be commonplace and pre-infection neutralizing antibody did not diminish or increase the frequency of illness with infection other interpretations of the data must remain tentative to the extent that the specificity of the cf test is not yet clearly defined present information concerning this may be summarized as follows a serologic relation of 229e to viruses of other common groups has not been found in previous or the present studies 1 7  however within the coronavirus group neither the number of human respiratory immunotypes nor the extent of their serologic cross-reactivity are fully known an antigenic relationship has been demonstrated by cf and hi tests between certain members such as oc 3843 and mhv and other less well defined cf cross-reactions may exist within the group 7 17  however a common group antigen such as is found in the adeno and influenza viruses has not been demonstrated in the case of 229e studies with hyperimmune an-imal sera have revealed no clear evidence of cf cross-reactions between this virus and mhv ibv and oc 3843 7 17  furthermore sera of human subjects with presumed or known infections with other respiratory coronaviruses have only occasionally shown heterotypic responses to 229e 7 11 17  however even though these studies have not demonstrated extensive cf crossrelations between 229e and presently recognized coronaviruses the observations are relatively few in number do reveal some degree of cross-reactivity and do not preclude the possibility that this may exist to an even greater extent with other as yet unrecognized coronaviruses seroconversion to 229e was found more commonly by the cf than the neutralizing antibody test this was clearly seen in 1966-1967 when both tests were used to follow all students cf seroconversion occurred in virtually all students with neutralizing seroconversion 29 of 33 and an additional 37 students showed seroconversion by cf test only in other years of the study when neutralizing antibody tests were only done on students with cf seroconversion only half of these showed significant rises of neutralizing antibody titer if it is assumed that in these other years as in 1966-1967 cf seroconversion identified most of the students with neutralizing antibody titer rises it was the overall experience that seroconversion to 229e occurred twice as often by the cf as by the neutralizing antibody test this difference in cf and neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates could not be entirely accounted for by the decision that 2x cf rises were significant although students with 2x cf titer rises showed concomitant neutralizing antibody seroconversion less frequently than those with 4x cf titer rises 2x reactors appeared to relate to 54x reactors as the lower end of a continuum in which the frequency of neutralizing antibody seroconversion was directly related to the extent of cf antibody titer rise this was true in each of the high prevalence seasons and in the overall experience the portion of cf reactors with concomitant neutralizing antibody rises was 35 45 and 78 per cent of students with 2x 4x and 8x cf rises respectively it should also be noted that 2x and 4x rises were similar in respect to seasonal distribution and the relation of seroconversion to illness thus either or both lesser specificity or greater sensitivity of the cf test also contributed to the difference in cf and neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates the observations made in these studies do not provide the basis for a clear choice between these alternatives infection with other virus es cross-reacting with 229e by cf at low titer could be postulated as the origin of the small number of exclusively 2x cf rises that were seen in low frequency seasons but this would not account for the observation that three of 12 students with cf rises under these circumstances had concomitant neutralizing antibody titer rises to 229e a similar explanation could be proposed for the finding that pre-existing neutralizing antibody was associated with a diminished frequency of seroconversion by the neutralization test but did not influence the frequency of seroconversion by the cf test however if the cf seroconversions in students with high levels of 229e neutralizing antibody in their pre-infection serum were due to infection with one or more other viruses having cf cross-reactivity with 229e it must be further assumed that something acted to restrict infection rates with the same agents in students with low levels of 229e neutralizing antibody otherwise it might be expected that the latter group of students subject to infection with 229e as well as the hypothesized cross-reacting agents would have shown higher cf seroconversion rates than the students subject to infection only by the cross-reacting viruses the cf seroconversion rates observed were if anything lower in students with low levels of pre-infection neutralizing antibody that different agents would show such nicely reciprocal infection rates seems somewhat improbable it is however also possible that the cf test is almost or indeed as specific as the neutralizing antibody test and where serum specimens are closely spaced considerably more sensitive immunologic factors related to the transient elevation of cf antibody and persistent elevation of neutralizing antibody following infection could play a role in this the adverse effect of high levels of pre-infection antibody on the serodiagnosis of streptococcal and poliovirus infection has previously been commented upon 18 19 20  in the case of 229e long persisting neutralizing antibody may diminish the likelihood that the antigenic stimulus of reinfection will evoke a measureable rise in titer of this antibody while this would not be the case with the cf antibody response indeed if it is assumed that at least a portion of the antibody reacting in the cf test is produced by a segment of the immune system that can develop persisting sensitization past infection would actually serve to enhance the frequency of measureable cf response to reinfection  there is not yet sufficient information about the human respiratory coronavimses to determine the extent to which sensitivity specificity or both factors account for the observed differences in neutralizing and cf antibody seroconversion rates even so certain conclusions can be drawn from the results of the cf survey about the overall role of these viruses in acute respiratory illnesses of humans whether in response to infection with only 229e or infection with one or more other serotypes of coronaviruses cf antibody titer rises to 229e occurred in all six seasons of these studies and were significantly related to acute respiratory illnesses if the twofold greater cf than neutralizing antibody seroconversion rate is to be attributable to lesser specificity of the cf test then among the human respiratory coronaviruses yet to be discovered there must be one or more that circulate widely and share cf antigens with 229e however if the difference in seroconversion rates is to be attributed to the factor of sensitivity several other interesting considerations follow first in respect to reinfection the nearly uniform rate of cf antibody seroconversion to 229e observed among individuals with high as well as low levels of pre-infection neutralizing antibody describes a dissociation between naturally acquired serum antibody and resistance to reinfection under conditions of natural challenge that is unusual although it has been shown that naturally acquired local respiratory tract antibody is a better predictor than serum antibody of resistance to reinfection with parainfluenza 21 22 and rs 23 viruses a correlation has nevertheless been demonstrable between naturally acquired serum antibody and resistance to reinfection with influenza 24 parainfluenza 21 22 25 and rhinoviruses 26  while the apparent dissociation of prechallenge neutralizing antibody and reinfection with 229e as measured by cf antibody seroconversion may simply be an extreme example of the fact that circulating antibody is only an indirect indicator of surface immunity it could also be interpreted as suggesting that resistance to reinfection is particularly evanescent in the case of the human respiratory coronavirus that many of the 229e infections were indeed reinfections was clear from both the virus isolation and the neutralizing antibody seroconversion data similar findings in respect to oc 43 have been described by kaye et al 12 who found that almost 50 per cent of children aged 10-14 years who developed hi seroconversions to oc 43 had pre-existing antibody titers of 110 or greater it might also be emphasized here that not only seroconversion rates but also the frequency with which such seroconversions were illness associated were unaffected by the presence of pre-infection antibody in both the present studies of 229e and those of oc 43 12  an unusual aspect of the seroepidemiology of 229e referred to above 11  might also be explained on the basis of transience of cf antibody and the enhancement of this antibody response after reinfection this is the failure to find cf antibody in the acute or convalescent serum specimens of either children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract illness or those hospitalized for nonrespiratory tract disease although such antibody was found in sera collected from adults with acute respiratory illness from the same general but different specific locale and time period this could reflect the fact that 229e infections of young children are unusual or at least seldom of severity that requires hospitalization however the experience with other viruses that cause acute respiratory disease in the general population such as influenza parainfluenza rhino and rs viruses is that they circulate among children as well as or to a greater extent than among adults 27 28  suggesting that this may indeed also be true of 229e virus is the finding by bradburne 8 of neutralizing antibody to this virus in the sera of eight of 32 children aged 0-5 years and serologic studies in this laboratory indicating a similar prevalence of 229e in the pre-school age group 29  therefore lessened serologic responsiveness rather than lower infection rates in this age group must be entertained as a possible explanation of the paucity of cf antibody to 229e observed in the sera of infants and young children finally this possible enhancement of cf and diminution of neutralizing antibody responsiveness with reinfection could have an important bearing on the procedure of choice for serologic diagnosis of 229e infection in subjects of different ages thus the neutralization test would be the procedure of choice for infants and young children and the cf test the most sensitive proce-dure provided serum specimens are closely spaced for older children and adults  middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission in extended family saudi arabia

daniel feikin r tariq madani a   to find cases we interviewed clinicians reviewed regional records and searched a national laboratory database we interviewed all persons who had received a mers-cov diagnosis in the region and reviewed hospitalized patients medical charts proxy interviews were conducted for patients who were in the intensive care unit or who had died we then conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess infection risk factors among household members we aimed to interview and test all members of the 4 households of the 5 known mers-covinfected patients as well as relatives who regularly visited these households and were present on the day of the on-site investigation on june 5 trained nurses collected 1 oropharyngeal and 1 nasopharyngeal swab for rrt-pcr and 1 blood sample for serologic testing from all available household members and visiting relatives hospitalized persons persons who previously had tested positive by rrt-pcr and children 14 years of age did not undergo serologic testing local public health officials had previously collected oropharyngeal swabs for rrt-pcr in the households during may 2029 we reviewed these records on june 5 trained physicians administered a standardized questionnaire to household members and visiting relatives to identify symptoms and healthcare exposures and infection risk factors including animal contact recent travel underlying medical conditions tobacco use and details of exposure to each households index patient an index patient was defined as the person with rrt-pcr confirmation of mers-cov who had the earliest date of symptom onset in the household to understand whether this outbreak was affecting the broader community we collected data at the towns hospital at the outpatient clinic nearest the familys homes at 2 local slaughterhouse facilities and at the towns weekly livestock animal market all hospital staff members who had treated the first identified mers-cov patient from his admission on may 9 until his mers-cov diagnosis on may 20 underwent hospital-based rrt-pcr of oropharyngeal swabs may 2123 serologic testing was not performed at the outpatient clinic all staff and a convenience sample of patients who visited the clinic on june 4 with respiratory symptoms or fever were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire and tested for mers-cov by using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for rrt-pcr and blood for serologic testing all animal workers at 2 local slaughterhouse facilities and a convenience sample of persons with daily animal contact who were present at the towns weekly livestock animal market on june 4 were interviewed and tested by using the same methods specimens from hospitalized patients and hospital staff members underwent rrt-pcr at the ministry of healths jeddah regional laboratory according to ministry of health protocol 18 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal flocked swabs collected in the households at the community clinic and in animal workers were placed in viral transport media and transferred at 4c to king abdulaziz university where rrt-pcr amplification of consensus viral rna targets upstream of e and open reading frame 1a was undertaken 19 serum samples were sent to cdc and screened for mers-cov antibodies by the recombinant mers-cov nucleocapsid protein elisa and confirmatory testing was conducted with immunofluorescence assay and microneutralization 20 we analyzed questionnaire data using epi info 70 cdc atlanta ga usa proportions were compared by using the 2 or fischer exact test and medians by using wilcoxon rank-sum risk ratios rrs were calculated we compared questionnaire data for all mers-covpositive by rrt-pcr or serology relatives 14 years of age with questionnaire data for all mers-covnegative relatives 14 years of age we excluded children from analysis because they had not had antibody testing of serum a household secondary transmission analysis comprised relatives 14 years of age residing only in the 4 affected households results for mers-covpositive household members who had illness onset or tested mers-covpositive at least 2 days after the households index patients illness onset were compared with results for mers-covnegative household members because this investigation was part of a public health response it was not considered by cdc and the saudi arabia ministry of health to be research that was subject to review by an institutional review board participants gave verbal consent mers-cov was diagnosed in 11 58 of the 19 patients by rrt-pcr the standard method in saudi arabia table 1 for 7 of these including the 5 original patients illness was diagnosed during may 20june 9 while they were hospitalized figure 2 for the other 4 patients l m n

cough subjective fever but had not sought medical care and 1 n the only child given a mers-cov diagnosis had visited an emergency department with fever in the 4 households all nonhospitalized family members were rrt-pcrnegative when tested on june 5 indicating little risk for ongoing household transmission for 8 42 of the 19 positive family members mers-cov infection was diagnosed only retrospectively by using serology all 8 previously had tested negative by rrt-pcr during april 21may 29 while hospitalized or during routine contact tracing and all again tested negative on june 5 two of these rrt-pcrnegative patients a and b had extended hospitalizations 2 patients g and h had brief hospitalizations 2 patients r and s had sought medical care but not required hospitalization and 2 p and q denied symptoms some of these patients had multiple negative tests during an april 2014 hospitalization in jeddah patient a the first patient in this family to become ill had 3 negative

of 18 mers-covpositive adults were male compared with 15 37 of 41 mers-covnegative adults p  00009 table 2 mers-covpositive adults were more likely to have smoked sheesha the traditional water pipe

during the month before becoming ill mers-covpositive adults were older median age 37 years vs 25 years p  00011 and more likely to report chronic medical problems 8 44 vs 5 12 p  0006 including diabetes mellitus and heart disease all mers-covpositive relatives denied animal contact during the 14 days before testing in household 1 eight of the 12 adults a husband and wife 5 of their adult sons and 1 sons wife and 1 of the 7 children received a mers-cov diagnosis household attack rate 44 household adult attack rate 64 figure 1 in household 2 five of the 12 adults a husband and wife and 3 of their adult sons received a mers-cov diagnosis household attack rate 29 household adult attack rate 42 in households 3 and 4 only the index patients both adult men tested positive no secondary patients were identified all family members in whom mers-cov symptoms developed or who had positive rrt-pcr results reported contact with at least 1 ill relative in the preceding 14 days figure 3  when we compared results for the 9 secondary adult patients adults who tested mers-covpositive with illness onset after the presumed index patient in these 4 households with the results for 21 adults in the households who tested negative we identified several major risk factors for mers-cov transmission in univariate analysis table 3 these risk factors included sleeping in the same room as an index patient rr 41 95 ci 15112 touching his respiratory secretions rr 40 95 ci 1698 and removing his biological waste rr 32 95 ci 1284 notable variables not associated with being a secondary patient included hugging or social kissing sharing plates cups meals sheesha or a toilet and cleaning or feeding the index patient except for members of this extended family the regional hospital admitted no other mers-cov patients of 131 hospital workers who cared for patient c 1 08 a nurse who remained asymptomatic tested positive by rrt-pcr on may 23 all 44 persons tested at the outpatient clinic 21 patients with respiratory complaints and 23 staff were mers-covnegative by both rrt-pcr and serology all 11 slaughterhouse workers and 10 livestock market participants tested negative by rrt-pcr one 5 asymptomatic slaughterhouse worker demonstrated antibodies to mers-cov by serology he had no known contact with any family members in the cluster this investigation defined the epidemiology of a large family cluster of mers-cov infection in saudi arabia identified multiple possible household transmission risk factors and highlighted the useful role of serology in describing the extent of family clusters and spectrum of illness for approximately half 42 of the 19 mers-covinfected family members rrt-pcr results were negative while they were ill or after recognized exposure and infection was diagnosed only retrospectively by serology this included patients tested during extended hospitalizations and demonstrates real-world limitations in rrt-pcr or timing of specimen collection transport and testing this finding highlights the need for clinicians to consider mers-cov diagnoses in appropriate clinical settings even in patients with negative rrt-pcr results clinicians should consider obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens to improve the sensitivity of rrt-pcr particularly if nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal test results are negative and clinical suspicion is high and they should consider follow-up serologic testing most importantly clinicians should apply appropriate infection control practices for patients with clinically suspected illness regardless of initial rrt-pcr results only 3 of the 19 mers-covinfected family members were women all wives of patients infection predominance in males has characterized mers-cov since its identification 64 of patients globally have been male 5 and might reflect biologic or behavior differences such as men and women socializing separately 2122 underlying illness has previously been linked to more severe mers-cov symptoms and signs 23 but whether underlying illness also makes persons more susceptible to initial mers-cov infection is less clear this study in which 96 of household members were tested found an increased infection risk among persons with underlying chronic illnesses our data indicate close contact eg sleeping in the same room as an index patient and direct patient care activities eg touching a patients respiratory secretions and removing his body waste rather than casual contact or simple proximity increases risk for transmission although smoking sheesha was a statistically significant risk factor for infection the 2 infected family members who smoked sheesha denied smoking together making it an unlikely mechanism of transmission guidance on preventing household transmission of mers-cov should emphasize minimizing close contact with patients outside of this extended family and 1 asymptomatic exposed nurse and 1 asymptomatic camel slaughterhouse worker we did not find evidence for wider community transmission of mers-cov two 11 of the infected family members died as of may 1 2016 saudi arabia had reported 588 deaths among 1380 confirmed mers-cov patients for an overall 43 case-fatality rate 17 the substantially lower fatality rate in this family most likely reflects aggressive contact tracing and use of serology to identify mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients patients in this family also were younger median age 37 years than mers-cov patients globally median 48 years 5 the case-fatality rate in this cluster might reflect the broader population across the spectrum of illness previously described mers-cov family clusters and household contact investigations have reported household attack rates ranging from 1 to 19 1114 household attack rates in this investigation were markedly higher 64 and 42 of the adults in 2 households were infected this difference could be due to methodologic differences in our investigation serology identified mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients which would increase the attack rate over investigations that relied only on rrt-pcr the attack rate however could have actually been higher in this cluster for several reasons first mers-cov diagnoses were missed or delayed among the first cases in the family the first 2 patients to become ill patients a and b were hospitalized but had negative rrt-pcr results during illness their subsequent positive serologic results confirmed that the earlier illness had in fact been undiagnosed mers-cov the third patient patient c was ill for 14 days before receiving a diagnosis a time during which many other family members reported contact with him because this community had not previously experienced mers-cov infections family members and local hospital staff might have had limited suspicion for mers-cov infection and not limited close contact in contrast when mers-cov infection was diagnosed in index patients in households 3 and 4 the family and local hospital staff was highly attuned to the possibility of mers-cov infection and took precautions to prevent its spread second patient c might have been part of a super-spreading event because up to 8 other infected persons might have been infected through contact with him figure 3 the concept of a super-spreading event was described during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003 2425 and more recently was observed in the mers-cov outbreak in healthcare facilities in south korea where each of 3 patients was associated with infection in 20 other persons 2627 finally although all infected persons denied animal contact and the range of symptom onset dates indicated ongoing person-to-person spread an environmental point-source of infection might have been missed our study had several limitations first in household 1 two persons had in fact been ill with mers-cov before the presumed household index patient received a diagnosis these persons had negative rrt-pcr results while ill and infection was diagnosed retrospectively when later serologic test results were positive the study questionnaire focused primarily on household exposures to the presumed index patient but persons in this household might have had a range of exposures to all 3 persons making isolation of the specific exposure that resulted in secondary infection more difficult second the small sample size did not enable multivariable risk factor analysis and confounding and collinearity could not be evaluated third serologic testing was not conducted for children 14 years of age and they were excluded from risk factor analysis the observed lower incidence of infection among children could be investigated by including children in future serologic investigations fourth sequential serologic testing was not performed so it is possible that persons identified as mers-cov-negative might not yet have seroconverted although none had developed respiratory illnesses before or after testing finally specimens were not available for genome sequencing which might have helped to clarify transmission chains within the family  more studies are needed to define the virologic and epidemiologic factors involved in household transmission of mers-cov to inform future public health response including serologic methods in these investigations will help better identify the spectrum of mers-cov clinical presentations as testing methods evolve maintaining strict infection control practices for ill patients with strong epidemiologic risk factors for mers-cov remains crucial to containing further spread  antibody response to infectious diseases and other factors accurately predict covid-19 infection and severity risk 1014 years later a retrospective uk biobank cohort study aa willette sa willette q wang c pappas bs klinedinst s le b larsen a pollpeter n brenner t waterboer   coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel beta-coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-21 has become a worldwide pandemic severely disrupting the economic social and psychological well-being of countless people clinical presentation of covid-19 widely varies ranging from asymptomatic profiles to mild symptoms like high fever or cough to acute respiratory disease syndrome and death given this heterogeneous symptom presentation as well as difficulties with serology testing and contact tracing worldwide public health efforts continue to focus on containment and especially isolating adults most at risk for covid-19 infection and severe disease by extension an expanding body of research has investigated potential factors that increase covid-19 infection and disease severity risk it is well known for example that adults aged 65 years are much more likely to be hospitalized or die due to covid-19 obesity itself and adverse health behaviors like smoking also increase infection risk and likelihood of hospitalization23 several age and obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease cardiometabolic diseases eg type 2 diabetes hypertension and other disease states and syndromes are also of concern4 non-white ethnicity particularly being black regardless of country of origin socioeconomic deprivation and low levels of education even after adjustment for health factors point to less privilege unfortunately conferring risk5 among biological markers covid-19 infection or severity has been related to higher c-reactive protein and more circulating white blood cells and lower counts of lymphocytes or granulocytes eg monocytes68 sars-cov-1 has a similar profile except for a relatively normal total white blood cell count9 these studies are invaluable for establishing or validating risk factors to guide clinical decisions and policymaker choices however we ultimately need to develop risk profiles derived from these factors to accurately predict who will and will not develop covid-19 and if a covid-19 disease course will be mild or presumptively severe ie require hospitalization machine learning data-driven modelling can be used to create robust highly accurate prediction models based on routinely collected biomedical data like demographics a complete blood count and standard medical biochemistry data critically using non covid-19 serological data we may gain insight into the hosts ability to fight covid-19 by examining antibody titers that detail the host response to past infectious pathogens this virome may affect host innate and adaptive immunity910 for example human cytomegalovirus vastly changes the composition of t and b cells11 and may induce immune senescence that could account for worse sars-cov-2 infection outcomes therefore similar to previous work12 our objective was to use machine learning to determine what combinations of baseline measures collected 1014 years ago could best predict which older adults developed covid-19 and if disease presentation was mild or severe in summary we achieved a 935 accuracy for predicting covid-19 infection based on a combination of age biochemistry and leukocyte markers and antibody titers to common pathogens like human cytomegalovirus human herpesvirus 6 and chlamydia trachomatis for covid-19 severity due to small sample size only antibody titers loaded for finals models that more modestly predicted severe disease 744 nonetheless this is the first report to propose retrospective risk factor profiles to clarify and better characterize who is most at risk for covid-19 in addition our results suggest that past infection history and antibody response may be an invaluable novel predictor of host immunity to covid-19 that warrants further study this retrospective study involved the uk biobank cohort13 uk biobank consists of approximately 500000 people now aged 50 to 84 years mean age694 years baseline data was collected in 20062010 at 22 centers across the united kingdom1415 summary data is listed in table 1 our study used the may 26th 2020 tranche of covid-19 polymerase chain reaction pcr data from public health england the following categories of predictors were downloaded 1 demographics 2 health behaviors and long-term disability or illness status 3 anthropometric and bioimpedance measures of fat muscle and water content 4 pulse and blood pressure 5 a serum panel of thirty biochemistry markers commonly collected in a hospital setting and 6 a complete blood count with a manual differential for quantitation of total white blood cells and sub-types among a randomized subset of 9695 participants as part of a separate pilot project baseline serum was thawed and tested to determine levels of antibodies to several antigens of 20 infectious diseases study subjects provided electronic signed informed consent at recruitment ethics approval for the uk biobank study was obtained from the national health service health research authority north west - haydock research ethics committee 16nw0274 the detailed protocol is outlined at httpswwwukbiobankacuk through a may 26th 2020 data upload from uk biobank our study was based on covid pcr test data available from march 16th to may 19th 2020 there were 4510 unique participants that had 7539 individual tests administered hereafter called cases or test cases for modeling covid-19 infection data each test case was coded by uk biobank as 0 and 1 respectively representing a negative or positive pcr test for modeling covid-19 disease severity each test case was coded as 0 and 1 which represented out-patient testing ie mild case or hospital in-patient testing with clinical signs of infection ie presumptively severe case to offer insight into this frequently updated resource roughly weekly updates by public health england since inception late aprilearly may have so far consisted of new participants tested for the first time 356 or who have follow-up testing 644 as of the may 26th 2020 upload see table 1 a given participant had anywhere between 1 and 20 tests for covid-19 mean25 tests with 18  41 days between each test based on initial modelling there are not yet enough test cases per participant to robustly model complex changes in disease status as of june 5th 2020 an in-vs outpatient identification issue had been raised for 6 out of 105 hospitals and clinics thankfully we found no evidence in our prediction models that laboratory of clinical origin influenced our results these factors included participant age in years at baseline sex education qualifications ethnicity and townsend deprivation index sex was coded as 0 for female and 1 for male for education higher scores roughly correspond to progressively more skilled tradevocational or academic training and skill need to attain the qualification ethnicity was coded as uk citizens who identified as white blackblack british or asianasian british the townsend index16 is a standardized score based on postal code ie zip code data taken from the census indicating the relative degree of deprivation or poverty presumably experienced by the participant based on their permanent address this category consisted of self-reported alcohol status smoking status a subjective health rating on a 14 likert scale excellent to poor and whether the participant had a self-described long-term medical condition illness or disability as noted in table 1 484 of participants indicated having such an ailment we independently confirmed with icd-10 based nhs-confirmed diagnoses that this self-report data was accurate these conditions included all-cause dementia and other neurological disorders various cancers major depressive disorder cardiovascular eg myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular diseases and events eg stroke cardiometabolic diseases eg type 2 diabetes renal and pulmonary diseases eg copd and other so called pre-existing conditions we chose to use this single latent variable for simplicity and because there were widely varying numbers of cases that severely underpowered our multivariable classifier analyses the first automated reading of pulse diastolic and systolic blood pressure at the baseline visit were used anthropometric measures of adiposity body mass index waist circumference were derived as described17 data also included bioelectrical impedance metrics that estimate central body cavity ie trunk and whole body fat mass fat-free muscle mass andor water content18 serum biomarkers were assayed from baseline samples as previously described19 see table 1 for data summaries of the full covid-19 sample and the sub-group with serology data briefly using immunoassay or clinical chemistry devices spectrophotometry was used to initially quantify values for 34 biochemistry analytes uk biobank deemed 30 of these markers to be suitably robust after rigorous quality control to minimize systematic bias and random error in sample thawing and processing we downloaded all fully quality-controlled data from the main showcase we rejected a further 4 markers due data missingness 70 estradiol rheumatoid factor or because there was strong overlap with other variables that had more stable distributions or trait-like qualities glucose rejected vs glycated hemoglobin or hba1c direct bilirubin rejected vs total bilirubin as described httpbiobankctsuoxacukcrystalcrystaldocsinfdiseasepdf among 9695 randomized uk biobank participants selected from the full cohort baseline serum was thawed and pathogen-specific assays run in parallel using flow cytometry on a luminex bead platform20 here the goal of the multiplex serology panel was to measure multiple antibodies against several antigens for different pathogens reducing noise and estimating the prevalence of prior infection and seroconversion in at least uk biobank all measures were initially confirmed in serum samples using gold-standard assays with median sensitivity and specificity of 970 and 937 respectively antibody load for each pathogen-specific antigen was quantified using median fluorescence intensity mfi caga titer load to h pylori was excluded due to lab-based data loss because seropositivity is difficult to assess for several pathogens we did not use pathogen prevalence as a predictor in models table 2 shows the selected pathogens their respective antigens estimated prevalence of each pathogen based roughly on antibody titers and assay values this array ranges from delta-type retroviruses like human t-cell lymphotropic virus 1 that are rare 1 to human herpesviruses 6 and 7 that have an estimated prevalence of more than 90 spss subscription build 1001327 was used for all analyses due to differences in sample size mann-whitney u and kruskal-wallis tests were used to compare quantitative values and categories eg sex for all 7539 test cases and the 124 test cases with serology data ie the serology sub-group linear discriminant analysis lda was then leveraged using individual predictors or weighted combinations of predictors to maximally distinguish between 1 negative or positive diagnosis for covid-19 and 2 mild or severe covid-19 disease status lda relies on a regression-like linear set of functions that can combine several data ie features and create predictive models that are straightforward to interpret it is recognized that having a small number of test cases such as in the serology sub-cohort with many data types and features can lead to overfitting21 to guard against non-robust estimations parametric violations and model overfitting 1-fold cross-validation with non-parametric bootstrapping 95 confidence interval 1000 iterations was used while logistic regression is more robust to outliers than lda uk biobank data is vigorously quality-controlled to remove extreme values due to the small sample size of the serology sub-group logistic regression also would be more likely to have model overfitting that inflates true accuracy first lda was used to examine how useful each baseline predictor was for correctly determining covid-19 infection classification negative positive and disease severity mild severe this was done separately for all 7539 test cases and the 124 test cases in the serology sub-group next a series of forced entry models were used to see how well a set of related variables or features eg demographics predicted covid-19 infection or disease severity we recognize that some of these forced entry models are likely overfitted particularly for modeling disease severity risk nonetheless these models may provide a best case scenario for how well or poorly a class of predictors can perform in classification finally a stepwise approach wilks lambda f value entry384 was used to combine predictors into a risk profile that best classified covid-19 infection or separately for severity risk for each classification model the accuracy ie percentage of test cases that were correctly classified sensitivity ie true positives correctly identified and specificity ie true negatives correctly identified were calculated the area under the curve auc with a 95 confidence interval ci was also used receiver operating characteristic roc curves plotting sensitivity against 1-specificity were created to visualize differences in prediction accuracy among sets of similar predictors or stepwise models for stepwise models the wilks lambda statistic and standardized coefficients were used to interpret how well and in what direction a given variable discriminated between positive vs negative covid-19 infection and mild vs severe disease a lower wilks lambda corresponds to a stronger influence on the canonical classifier alpha was set at 05 the funders of the study had no role in the study design data collection data analysis or interpretation or writing of this report the corresponding author aaw had full access to all of the data in this study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit the report for publication as shown in table 1 7539 total test cases for covid-19 were conducted among 4510 uk biobank participants 696  88 years between march 16th to may 19rd 2020 either in outpatient or inpatient settings there were 5329 negative cases and 2210 positive cases of the positive cases there were 996 mild and 1214 presumptively severe disease outcomes defined as a test case occurring in a hospital setting baseline data from 1014 years ago mean  1122 years was available for demographic laboratory biochemistry and clinical indices a central theme of this report is the comparison of the 7539 total test cases to a sub-group of 124 test cases with serology data table 2 in order to show that better model fit incorporating serology markers was not merely due to sample size differences or model inflation using non-parametric tests then table 1 indicates that the full cohort and serology sub-groups largely did not differ on most measures a few significant differences were clinically unremarkable for the serology sub-cohort and well within the range of normal values including lower pulse rate several markers reflecting better kidney function and a mean 06 109l lower total white blood cell count due to fewer lymphocytes next each baseline variable was used to predict covid-19 infection for a given test case for context 706 of the 7539 test cases were negative consequently any predictor achieving an accuracy of 706 would be performing at chance a better measure of accuracy in this case is the auc where 05 is at-chance prediction and 10 is perfect accuracy we also focused on how well true covid-19 positive cases were identified ie sensitivity among all participants supplementary table 1 any given significant predictor could not correctly distinguish any true positive test cases 0 sensitivity auc mean and range0525 05150548 for the serology sub-cohort supplementary table 2 several established risk factors that loaded had better overall fit mean auc0625 auc range05280712 due to better sensitivity of predicting infection examples included ethnicity 132 alcohol status 154 apolipoprotein b 103 and two unusually strong biochemistry analytes urate 256 and testosterone 564 in order to see if biomarkers of past host response to pathogens was useful for predicting a current host response to covid-19 we then tested each antibody titer for an antigen to a specific pathogen as shown in supplementary table 3 antibody titers to 14 antigens across 12 pathogens each performed as well on average as other types of predictors mean auc0627 auc range05050707 in particular sensitivity was notable for antibody to the pp150 nter antigen to human cytomegalovirus 333 and bk vp1 to human t lymphotropic virus 1 308 lastly as listed in table 3 sets of similar predictors were forced into a classifier model to gauge how well they collectively predicted covid-19 infection a stepwise model was also used to create a classifier that only included predictors which each provided unique predictive utility among all 7539 test cases top row sets of predictors including the stepwise model were only able to correctly identify covid-19 positive test cases up to 10 of the time supplementary table 4 illustrates that predictors loading in the stepwise model included lipid and kidney health markers white cell counts as well as smoking status ethnicity and the townsend deprivation index in the serology sub-group bottom row some relatively sparse predictor sets had better sensitivity eg 533 while the biochemistry and serology forced entry models were likely overfitted the analyses may nonetheless provide a best case scenario for their usefulness as a group notably the stepwise model achieved 935 accuracy by correctly identifying when a covid-19 test case was negative 941 specificity or positive 923 sensitivity due to potential concerns with model overfitting the stepwise model was re-run with only predictors that had individually loaded significantly supplementary tables 2
and
3 this model had 6 variables and still achieved 798 accuracy as shown in supplementary table 4 predictors that loaded in the stepwise model included antibody titers for antigens of several common pathogens eg human cytomegalovirus chlamydia trachomatis lipid markers age in years white and red cell counts and testosterone another set of analyses next determined how each baseline predictor could predict which of the 2210 positive covid-19 cases had a mild or severe disease course for context 45 and 55 of test cases were mild or severe respectively thus accuracy of 50 would be considered chance prediction curiously while sensitivity was the difficult metric to achieve for covid-19 infection risk accurately distinguishing true negatives ie specificity was problematic for disease severity among all 2210 covid-19 positive test cases supplementary table 5 significant predictors showed a trade-off between better sensitivity or specificity and in general were only modestly useful auc mean and range0536 05240572 similarly for the serology only sub-group among 39 covid-19 positive test cases supplementary table 6 shows that only alanine aminotransferase and neutrophil count significantly predicted disease severity beyond chance likewise for serology data supplementary table 7 indicates that the only significant antibodies to load were for the u14 antigen to human herpesvirus 7 accuracy641 auc0729 and jc vp1 antigen to human jc polyomavirus accuracy59 auc 0671 table 4 shows the relative predictive value of groups of predictors for covid-19 severity first for the full sample of 2210 positive test cases accuracy remained low and the proportion of true negatives ie specificity identified did not exceed 37 this was regardless of predictor sets with a sparse or dense number of predictors supplementary table 8 illustrates that the stepwise model included only alanine aminotransferase age in years and monocyte count which may explain its modest predictive utility above chance for the serology sub-group of 39 test cases despite strong concerns about model overfitting the accuracy sensitivity and specificity were similarly modest compared to all 2210 positive test cases for the biochemistry immunology and serology panels the stepwise model was sparse and had better overall accuracy 744 due to improved detection of actual mild cases 615 indeed supplementary table 8 shows that the stepwise model loaded 2 predictors antibody titers for htlv-1 gag antigen to the rare human t lymphotropic virus and jc vp1 antigen for the human polyomavirus that has an estimated prevalence of 575 in at least uk biobank the objective of this study was to determine if baseline data from 20062010 could predict which older adults would develop covid-19 in 2020 and if that infection was presumptively mild or severe due to being at hospital in summary using machine learning we developed separate risk profiles that accurately predicted future host immunity for covid-19 infection 935 and severity 744 such profiles only require retrospective routine self-report and blood tests typically collected in out- and in-patient clinics and hospitals as proof-of-principle that these profiles work for example we confirmed as others have noted with previous uk biobank covid-19 data that non-white ethnicity low socioeconomic status and smoking can increase infectious risk5 our most novel finding was that antibody titers reflecting pathogen exposure history and past host immunity were strong predictors of covid-19 infection and severity both as a group and especially in concert with established risk factors like age neutropenia and dyslipidemia this virome may consist of beneficial and detrimental pathogens that change how the immune system responds to a novel persistent viral challenge like covid-1910 for example we found antigens to human cytomegalovirus were the strongest predictors of infection risk in our stepwise model older adults with prior human cytomegalovirus infection evince exhaustion of the nave t cell pool and fewer memory versus effector cells22 this may explain why monocyte count was one of the few variables to predict covid-19 severity among all test cases in this study as innate immunity must compensate for covid-19 severity prediction antibody titer to the jc polyomavirus was the only serology predictor that loaded significantly in our stepwise model and is expressed in a majority of the general population this virus can induce hemagglutination in type o blood cells23 which may in some way influence why this blood type may be protective for covid-19 infection this may also explain why higher red blood cell count appeared to be an important predictor for infection risk for other immunologic factors mobilization of innate immunity was not surprisingly relevant to infection risk and severity in particular granulocytes eg neutrophils monocytes loaded significantly in covid-19 infection and severity prediction models for stepwise models but not cytokines such as c-reactive protein c-reactive protein has been cited as a strong risk factor for covid-1924 however this marker merely reflects signaling of the acute phase response due to systemic infection typically being initiated by macrophages in contact with the pathogen and monocytes in the blood although lymphopenia and suppression of humoral immunity has been noted in covid-19 lymphocyte cell count was in this study a modest predictor by itself and did not load in final stepwise models we also confirmed and extended the importance of age and biological factors related to lipids and kidney health but curiously not obesity or comorbid conditions among now elderly adults in uk biobank age was one of the few factors to impact both infection and severity risk perhaps in concert lipoprotein metabolism changes with aging along with sedentary lifestyle can induce hyperlipidemia which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and may increase covid-19 infection risk25 the lack of association with bioimpedance-derived fat muscle and water quantitation or long-standing illness was unexpected but may be due to complex interactions that are beyond the scope of this report finally levels of testosterone by itself and in concert with other factors in the serology sub-group could strongly identify adults who would later develop covid-19 sex differences favoring covid-19 infection in men have been noted and andropause-induced reductions in testosterone occur in aging men as testosterone normally downregulates inflammation this loss may increase disease susceptibility26 some major limitations should be noted in our study at this time the number of uk biobank participants with covid-19 and serology data is low particularly for positive test cases to temper this issue we first used k-fold validation and rigorous bootstrapping to avoid model overfitting for the stepwise models we also rigorously tested each predictor or set of predictors in the main sample or serology sub-group where we found that model fit was not overly biased in general regardless we acknowledge that sets of predictors with many variables may be overly optimistic in their prediction value larger sample sizes and gold standard classification schemes such as training and testing using separate datasets will be needed to validate that antibody titers and past pathogen history in general are relevant markers for covid-19 infection and disease course another limitation was the modest predictive value of most variables across all test cases which stands in contrast to high odds ratios for some of these same factors in uk biobank and other cohorts studies with smaller sample sizes will often show inflated relative risk or prediction accuracy due simply to less heterogeneous error variance however our study only examined so called main effects of predictors instead of complex interactions such as darker skin vitamin d content and covid-19 infection risk such interactions were beyond the scope of this report which attempted to create relatively straightforward risk profiles that could be used in a clinic or by policymakers in summary this is the first study to systematically use retrospective data in a large community cohort to predict future risk for covid-19 infection and severity despite baseline data having been collected 1014 years ago we nonetheless achieved excellent to encouraging accuracy by combining several sets of emerging risk factors together it is especially interesting that serological data performed as well or better than any other data type future work should leverage past pathogen history and host immunity to inform what may happen when the host is challenged by covid-19  analysis of adjunctive serological detection to nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis rui liu xinghui liu li yuan huan han muhammad shereen adnan jiesheng zhen zhili niu dong li fang liu kailang wu zhen luo chengliang zhu   the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in china in later december 2019 and has become pandemic after global spreading sars-cov-2 has infected 76819 people out of which 12077 were critical 2251 died 29 fatality rate and 18878 clinically recovered during the first 50 days of the outbreak in china 1 2 as of june 6 2020 it has been reported 6663304 confirmed cases and 392802 deaths by sars-cov-2 infection among over 200 countries and territories 3 to mitigate the risk of spread it is necessary to investigate and develop effective treatment and diagnostic options the signs and symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection are not specific most are associated with respiratory complications after onsets such as cough dyspnea and viral pneumonia but the mortality of critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia is also considerable 4 5 therefore specific covid-19 diagnostic tests are required to confirm suspected cases accurately and shortly besides specific diagnostic techniques appropriate samples or specimens for the detection of the viral genome are also of high importance 6 7 previous studies on covid-19 pneumonia have largely focused on clinical characteristics and epidemiology 8 9 however very limited details are available related to effective diagnostic strategies in the current situation the specificity and sensitivity of the tests are not widely known therefore testing of multiple specimen types is recommended 10 11 the most widely used tests in the current situation are based on nucleic acid detection and antibody detection although the viral nucleic acid rt-pcr test has become the standard method for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis high false-negative rates were reported 12 thus an accurate and infallible detection for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis is urgently needed upon coronavirus infection igm antibodies are produced as an early immune response after infection in the body which may indicate current infection or new infection during the early stage of the infection days 410 the igm component of the test provides a sensitivity of just 70 this rises rapidly to 923 between days 11 and 24 and the igg component of the test offers a sensitivity of 986 during this phase of the infection or even longer 13 igg antibodies are the main antibodies produced as an immune response indicating that the disease has entered a recovery period or that there is a prior infection 14 15 therefore combined tests of immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg antibodies can not only provide the diagnosis of infectious diseases but also help to evaluate the stages of infection in the body 12 13 to explore the accurate and reliable detection for covid-19 diagnosis the present work was conducted to evaluate the nucleic acid-based and antibodies-based tests for sars-cov-2-infected patients a total of 133 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples from confirmed covid-19 patients were divided into three subgroups by the severity of illness and surveyed with nucleic acid test and igm-igg antibody test respectively moreover the igm and igg antibodies concentrations were also investigated with no differences among three subgroups based on the severity of covid-19 our findings revealed that the adjunct of the serological test to nucleic acid test improves the accuracy in covid-19 diagnosis after onsets a total number of 133 patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection in renmin hospital wuhan university china from january 23 to march 1 2020 were included as the case group in this study all patients were diagnosed according to the pneumonia diagnosis protocol for novel coronavirus infection trial version 5 subjected to the tests including clinical examination computed tomography ct and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 group was divided into three subgroups according to new pneumonia diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 trial version 5 including 44 moderate cases 52 severe cases and 37 critical cases table 2 the moderate severe and critical cases were defined based on symptoms severity and condition of the patients according to who interim guidance 16 briefly moderate cases were defined as mild symptoms including fever cough headache or soreness from cough but no pain while severe cases as severe signs including inflammation of lungs extreme breathlessness pain in the chest fast heartbeat or unwell appearance and low blood pressure the critical patients were defined as those admitted to the intensive care unit icu who required mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen fio2 of at least 60 or more as previously described 4 data on biochemical parameters were obtained from all 133 confirmed sars-cov-2 infected patients which was confirmed by a broad series of investigations including clinical examination laboratory tests chest x-rays and two independent real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 with sars-cov-2 orf1abn pcr detection kit geneodx biotech shanghai china as well as using a sars-cov-2 antibody detection kit yhlo biotech shenzhen china according to the standard procedure protocol the rt-pcr test was performed for sars cov-2 nucleic acid of nasopharyngeal swabs a cycle threshold ct value less than 37 was defined as a positive test result and a ct value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test according to the previous definition 9 the igm-igg antibody test was performed in serum or plasma as previously reported 17 clinical details and laboratory results were collected during routine clinical work through the patients interview the study was approved by the ethics committee and institutional review board of the renmin hospital of wuhan university certificate no wdry2020-k066 fluorescent quantitative rt-pcr was used to detect orf1ab and the nucleocapsid protein n genes in the sars-cov-2 genome sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results from ct cycle threshold value interpretation was subject to the manufacturers specification and the suspected results were notified of clinical resampling review the laboratory test results of both positive sars-cov-2 orf1ab and n genes or two consecutively positive sars-cov-2 orf1ab gene or n gene can determine the presence of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid in the samples sars-cov-2 igm-igg antibody detection kits were adopted for the direct chemiluminescence technique of two-step indirect immunoassay which were used for the qualitative detection of sars-cov-2 in human serum or plasma the procedure was performed according to the kit protocol provided and the test results were indicated by luminous strength relative light unit rlu the concentrations auml of sars-cov-2 igm or igg antibodies in the sample was correlated with the rlu and calculated based on the rlu and built-in calibration curve with the value of auml  10 as the positive reaction spss software version 250 ibm corp armonk ny usa was used for statistical analysis all quantitative data in non-normal or unknown distribution were expressed as median and interquartile range kruskal-wallis test was used to analyze differences among groups for the measurement data that did not meet the normal distribution the chi-square 2 test was used for the difference between groups of enumeration data in all tests p  005 was defined as statistically significant of 133 covid-19 patients admitted in the designated hospital between january 23 and march 1 2020 rt-pcr and igm-igg antibody tests were successively performed in the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection fig 1
 detailly 444 of patients were tested for nucleic acid and igm-igg antibody successively within a week while 458 of patients were diagnosed with the igm-igg antibody test a week or even longer after nucleic acid test fig 2
a to further examine the interval of igm-igg antibody test after covid-19 patients onsets 827 of patients were tested for igm-igg antibody during 1435 days after onset while 136 of patients were tested more than 35 days after onset only 38 of patients were tested within 14 days after onset fig 2b it was illustrated that the positive rate was 789 105133 and 970 129133 in igm and igg antibody test respectively while 684 91133 in rt-pcr detection for sars-cov-2 infection in all covid-19 patients table 1
 in detail 31 patients were tested igm positive and rt-pcr negative with the rt-pcr missed diagnosis rate of 316 42133 while 17 patients were tested igm negative and rt-pcr positive with the igm missed diagnosis rate of 211 28133 nevertheless only 11 patients were tested the combined rt-pcr and igm both negative with the missed diagnosis rate of 83 11133 fig 2c subset 1 in a similar analysis 38 patients were tested igg positive and rt-pcr negative with the rt-pcr missed diagnosis rate of 316 42133 whereas the igg missed diagnosis rate of 30 4133 in the combined rt-pcr and igg tests only 4 patients were both negative with the missed diagnosis rate of 30 4133 fig 2c subset 2 which significantly decreased false-negative results in covid-19 diagnosis table 1 we also observed igm and igg positive rates were 789 105133 and 970 129133 respectively with the missed diagnosis rate of 30 4133 in igm-igg antibody detection fig 2c subset 3 of note the 4 patients with both antibody and rt-pcr detection negative may be related to the improvement and recovery with clinical treatments altogether these data suggested that the antibody test could be an effective supplement to rt-pcr detection in the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection considering the severity of covid-19 patients from the critical care resources in hospitals 4 the covid-19 patients were divided into three subgroups for further analysis the three subgroups were divided as 44 moderate cases 22 males and 22 females the median age was 675 647175 52 severe cases 28 males and 24 females the median age was 68 612574 and 37 critical cases 20 males and 17 females the median age was 70 60765 table 2
 there was no significant difference in gender and age among the three subgroups in the rt-pcr detection for viral rna in three subgroups of covid-19 patients the positive rate was 659 in moderate cases 712 in severe cases and 676 in critical cases respectively table 3
 however we didnt observe significant differences in positive rate among three subgroups of covid-19 patients p  005 furthermore the antibodies-based tests were performed in three subgroups of covid-19 patients in igm antibody detection in patients infected with sars-cov-2 the positive rate was 795 in moderate cases 827 in severe cases and 730 in critical cases respectively similarly the positive rate from igg antibody test was 932 in moderate cases 100 in severe cases and 973 in critical cases respectively table 3 there was no statistically significant difference in the positive rate of igm-igg antibody detection for covid-19 patients among the three subgroups p  005 in total it appeared an increased positive rate in antibodies-based tests to that in the nucleic acid test indicating that the adjunct of serological test improved the accuracy in the covid-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illness finally the concentrations of igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 in the serological tests for covid-19 patients in different subgroups were examined the concentration of igm in patients was 2919 auml 17046102 in moderate cases 4076 auml 13569013 in severe cases and 2325 auml 8671045 in critical cases respectively meanwhile the concentration of igg in patients was 14773 auml 89531716 in moderate cases 14863 auml 130951677 in severe cases and 1404 auml 93791628 in critical cases respectively table 4
 collectively there were no significant differences in the concentrations of igm and igg antibodies among three subgroups of covid-19 patients suggesting the serological test behaved as a considerable diagnosis for covid-19 patients regardless of the severity of illness the outbreak of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 spreads rapidly posing a serious threat to the lives and health of the people which has become a serious global issue sars-cov-2 belongs to the coronavirus beta genus with a linear single-stranded positive rna the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans after sars 2002 and mers middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2012 18 there are various assays developed to detect different regions of sars-cov-2 genome using rt-pcr 10 19 in the present study we evaluated both antibody and nucleic acid -based diagnostic strategies on suspected patients with moderate to critical symptoms for covid-19 of the total 133 patients were tested 684 91133 were positive in the case of rt-pcr and 789 105133 in the case of the antibody test it was also observed an increased positive rate in antibodies-based tests to that in nucleic acid test in the diagnosis for covid-19 patients in different subgroups moderate cases severe cases and critical cases our findings suggested that the igm-igg antibody test provides an effective complement to the false-negative results from nucleic acid test for covid-19 diagnosis recently chest ct scans were applied for the rapid detection of sars-cov-2 induced covid-19 11 20 the chest x-ray or chest ct provides more information but these are not conclusive as not all the patients with covid-19 developed pneumonia and might produce false results as many other things can also cause pneumonia 21 22 therefore a more effective strategy such that testing antibodies or rna is important the conventional serologic assays droplet digital ddpcr crispr-based and metagenomic next-generation sequencing mngs techniques are also novel approaches for the detection of sars-cov-2 in fact the optimal diagnosis ways for sars-cov-2 are usually selected based on the periods of illness onsets eg rt-pcr or serologic assays the viral load of specimens eg rt-pcr or ddpcr assays and the aim of pathogen identification of unexplained pneumonia eg crispr-based or mngs techniques 12 23 24 25 hence it is highlighted that the combined tests on sars-cov-2 antibodies and rna for the high accuracy of covid-19 diagnosis according to the desired requirements sars-cov-2 is an emerging kind of infectious pathogen and the immunological testing reagents have recently been developing 12 it has been established a high sensitivity and specificity of sars-cov-2 igm and igg antibodies detection in serum or plasma from covid-19 patients without cross-reactivity within samples from non-infected individuals 12 26 although the antibodies generated after a period of the onset of infection their detections side by side with rt-pcr detection were found more promising as an accurate detection strategy in the current situation it is suggested that serum antibodies-based tests could be effectively adjunctive to rt-pcr test particularly for patients who had the substantial duration of illness in whom rt-pcr may be negative the combining rt-pcr and igm-igg antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 even in the early phase of one week 27 moreover there is an increase in the positive rate for sars-cov-2 igm and igg with an increasing number of days post-disease onset dpo as a result after 10 to 24 dpo or even longer to 35 dpo igm-igg antibody detection can be an important supplementary method for covid-19 diagnosis 26 27 serological based testing will become a very valuable tool to access previous exposures and prevalence in the population 13 in our study we examined the interval of igm-igg antibody test after covid-19 patients onset 827 of patients were tested for igm-igg antibody during 1435 dpo while 136 of patients were tested more than 35 dpo and only 38 of patients were tested within 14 dpo we also retrospectively observed that some patients were tested after onsets in a prolonged period which is explained that the lack of timely rt-pcr and igm-igg antibody tests in early covid-19 epidemic in wuhan in january 2020 fortunately the status had been improved that portions of patients were timely tested with a reasonable interval after onsets since late january 2020 due to the effective interventions and efforts made by the chinese government nevertheless the serological test still behaved as a considerable diagnosis for covid-19 patients after onsets certainly it was confirmed that the detection sensibility was higher in the igg-igm combined antibody test than in individual igg or igm antibody test 12 28 however a low viral load in patients throat and the limitation of rt-pcr result in a significant number of false-negative reports which should not be ignored 25 in general the coronavirus stimulates the immune response and igm antibodies are produced after 424 days upon infection and then quickly decline until disappear while on the other hand igg antibodies are usually produced after igm and continue to rise and remain high in the body for long periods 14 15 for treatment monitoring and status of the disease the decrease or even disappearance of the concentration of igm and the increase in the concentration of igg indicates the severity of the patient and the immunity to the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 actually we found there were no significant differences in the concentrations of igm and igg antibodies of covid-19 patients among three subgroups based on the severity of illness therefore further investigations should be made on a broad range and mainly focus on the antibodys response pattern and severity status of a larger scale of covid-19 patients on the bases of antibodies production in conclusion our study revealed that the igm-igg antibody test exhibited a useful adjunct to rt-pcr detection which improved the accuracy in the covid-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illness considering the significance of this ongoing covid-19 pandemics we believe that our findings are important in terms of providing promising diagnostic options based on age or gender groups as well as the severity of symptoms we further recommend the igm-igg antibody test provides an effective complement to nucleic acid test for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis

to influence the work reported in this paper  review of viral testing polymerase chain reaction and antibodyserology testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 for the intensivist michael motley p elliott bennett-guerrero bettina fries c eric spitzer d   sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family which consists of enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses seven viruses in this family infect humans and these fall into two genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus 1 sars-cov-2 belongs to the sarbecovirus subgenus of the betacoronavirus genus that also includes a number of bat-specific sars-related sarsr coronaviruses that share 96-78 of its genetic identity as well as sars-cov responsible for the 20022003 china outbreak which shares 80 identity 1 2 in contrast mers-cov responsible for the 2012 middle-east outbreak and 2015 korean outbreak and human coronaviruses hku1 and oc43 which commonly cause milder upper respiratory illness belong to other betacoronavirus subgenera merbecovirus and embecovirus respectively and are less related to sars-cov-2 the remaining two human coronaviruses nl63 and 229e are alphacoronaviruses that are more distantly related to sars-cov-2 though like hku1 and oc43 they are widely present in the community and cause cold-like illnesses 13 sars-cov-2 like sars-cov primarily infects pneumocytes within the hosts lungs this tropism is due to the virus ability to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors using the transmembrane spike s protein fig 1a the s protein found on the surface of the virus particle virion is one of four structural proteins spike nucleocapsid membrane and envelope found in all coronaviruses and is responsible for both the binding of the host receptor and the fusion of the virion with the host membrane structurally the s protein exists on the virion surface as a homotrimer comprised of three identical polypeptide chains each chain contains two subunits s1 and s2 subunit s1 makes up the majority of the s protein surface area and also includes the receptor binding domain rbd a small stretch of amino acids that allow sars-cov-2 to bind to the ace2 receptor 2 the rbd is the least genetically conserved portion of the s1 subunit sharing only 73 similarity with sars-cov and 2125 similarity to other human coronavirus s1 subunits 2 4 5 these genetic differences at the rbd dictate the viruss receptor specificity nearly all human coronaviruses other than sars-cov-2 and sars-cov bind glycoproteins or proteases other than ace2 although the distant relative nl63 appears to have independently evolved ace2 specificity 3 6 the s2 subunit tethers the s protein to the virion membrane and includes the machinery required for virus cell fusion 5 as these features are located deep within the s protein core s2 is more conserved than s1 90 similarity with sars-cov s2 and 3543 similarity with the other coronavirus s2s due to its location on the surface of the virus and its physiologic importance the coronavirus s protein is predictably immunogenic previous studies of sars-cov serum responses demonstrate that convalescent sera contain high titers of antibodies that bind to the s protein 7 some of these antibodies were also shown to protect cells from infection by live sars-cov in neutralization assays explained below 8 new studies focused on the current pandemic have also demonstrated that sera of previously infected sars-cov-2 patients react to sars-cov-2 s protein with some sera also cross-reacting with the sars-cov s protein 5 9 serum from patients infected with coronaviruses also exhibit high reactivity against another structural protein the nucleocapsid n protein or np 5 7 8 n protein which exhibits high homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 90 binds and stabilizes the viral genome 5 while abundant it is found exclusively within the virion nevertheless anti-n antibodies are highly prevalent postinfection possibly generated by the presentation of digested virus protein by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells to b cells 10 these antibodies may not provide direct protection from infection but n protein is historically easier to produce than s-protein for use in assays anti-n antibodies can be used to detect prior infection as their titers correlate with antibody titers to s-protein much like antibodies against hepatitis-b virus hbv core antigen correlate with those against hbv surface antigen 5 furthermore test vaccines against sars-cov have shown n antigens to be potent inducers of cd8 cytotoxic t cells that can recognize and kill infected cells that present np complexed to mhci and antibodies to n may correlate with the development of such a response 11 despite also being present on the surface the remaining structural proteins e and m are small and poorly exposed natural serum responses show few antibodies to these antigens 7 the sars-cov-2 virus was first characterized by the sequencing of its viral genome providing the requisite information to develop quantitative or real-time polymerase chain reaction qpcr tests for the virus 1 2 12 using cdna reverse-transcribed from viral rna extracted from the virus qpcr like pcr replicates a specific region or amplicon of the viral genome fig 1b through the use of fluorescent probes and detection steps between replication cycles qpcr allows quantitation of the amount of viral rna viral load in a sample as dna is synthesized exponentially during pcr the fluorescence also increases exponentially the thermocycler instrument reports a ct cycle threshold which is the number of replication cycles that are required to produce a fluorescent signal that exceeds a baseline samples that contain a large starting amount of viral rna require fewer cycles to produce a detectable fluorescent signal and therefore have a lower ct the ct has a simple negative linear correlation with the logarithm of the number of viral copies in the original sample this relationship can be used to quantify the amount of viral rna in a specimen however the assays must then include additional standards containing known concentrations of viral rna another type of diagnostic test that uses primer-directed replication loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp provides point-of-care qualitative results but the lack of discrete replication cycles does not allow accurate quantitation and these assays typically have a higher limit of detection than qpcr 13 14 currently as of may 16 2020 the fda has granted emergency use authorization eua for sars-cov-2 molecular tests to 61 test kit manufacturers and commercial laboratories and 28 laboratory-developed tests authorized for use by the singular developing laboratory while the initial eua molecular assays such as the one from centers for disease control and prevention  used manual protocols many of the subsequent commercial assays tend to use individual cartridges that contain all of the reaction components eg cepheid xpert or are performed on large robotic platforms that can process more than a 1000 specimens per day eg roche 68008800 cartridge-based assays offer rapid turnaround time within 60 min require less space and are simpler to deploy with the trade-off of greater cost per test and lower throughput instruments that use cartridge-type molecular tests such as the cepheid xpert biofire film array and genmark eplex are available in many smaller hospitals and can also be used for syndromic panels to detect a range of respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens larger health systems may use multiple types of analyzers to meet their particular needs they may use rapid low-throughput assays for the testing of urgent or emergent admissions as well as high-throughput instruments for less time-critical and more cost-efficient testing for inpatient units and outpatient settings where 6-24-hour turnaround times are more acceptable false-positive results for molecular tests are uncommon because of intrinsic designs and rigorous quality control guidelines the fidelity of base pairing makes qpcr and other amplification techniques highly specific distinguishing sar-cov-2 from other coronaviruses additionally the eua application process requires that a sars-cov-2 molecular test not cross-react with 20 commonly encountered respiratory pathogens and additionally have greater than 95 negative percent agreement analogous to specificity when there is no established reference method with at least 30 specimens that tested negative using another eua test in a recent study comparing four sars-cov-2 pcr assays with a range of sensitivities the negative percent agreement ranged from 96 to 100 15 nevertheless improper sample handling and contamination of reagents have the ability to create such false positives the clinical sensitivity of sars-cov-2 pcr tests the ability to detect infection using nasopharyngeal or other upper respiratory specimens is not well-defined since a positive pcr test is the gold standard for diagnosis in most published studies while the analytical sensitivity or limit of detection lod for a eua molecular test under ideal conditions can vary between 50 and 1000 viral copiesml 15 the clinical sensitivity depends also on factors related to collection of sample such as specimen type sars-cov-2 presence in the upper airways is less than that of the lower airways and nasopharyngeal swabs nasal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs differ greatly in their ability to detect virus 1619 one report found that 73 of 353 of patients who tested positive by nasopharyngeal swab tested negative by simultaneous oropharyngeal swab 16 and until recently nasopharyngeal swab has been the preferred specimen to collect sputum samples and pulmonary lavage have been shown to have higher sensitivity than both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs though the number of such samples tested has been small 1921 these lower respiratory specimens may be useful for detecting sars-cov-2 in severely ill patients however this type of testing is generally limited at present to large academic institutions and reference laboratories that have carried out the necessary validation experiments that must be performed before routinely testing these specimen types furthermore collection of these specimens can introduce additional risk to clinicians there is increasing evidence that molecular tests run on saliva may be also be a suitable and more easily obtained specimen 22 timing of specimen collection is also crucial to clinical sensitivity early in the course of infection viral loads are high typically in the range of 10000 to several million copiesml in upper respiratory specimens resulting in low ct readouts this is the case of both clinical disease and asymptomatic infection as symptoms of covid-19 tend to result from the immune response to the infection over a few days these high viral loads can decrease by a 1000-fold or more 23 drops in viral load during late acute illness may be inconsequential for more sensitive assays under ideal collection conditions but may be missed if the collection method recovers too little rna or the test cannot detect enough this is especially true for tests using nasal or oropharyngeal swabs which can see significant drops in sensitivity after a week of symptoms 24 25 large studies comparing clinical sensitivity of diagnostic tests to well-defined clinical and laboratory criteria defining covid-19 disease are needed another diagnostic challenge is the interpretation of persistently positive pcr tests in convalescent patients it is not uncommon to have a positive pcr test often with a low viral load 46 weeks after the resolution of symptoms 24 26 pcr and related tests only detect genetic material including remnants of dead virus and do not necessarily indicate active infection by replicating virus indeed a small study using viral culture suggests that patients with protracted qpcr positivity may not be infectious 27 while qpcr of nasopharyngeal swabs remains the gold standard of testing acute cases laboratory tests that detect antiviral antibodies often referred to as serological tests can be an important adjunct to molecular assays amidst the current pandemic serological assays may detect the later stages of infection when they may be less detectable by some pcr tests 24 25 two studies showed that antibody testing can augment qpcr in improving overall sensitivity after day 7 of symptoms 24 25 although maximal sensitivity is not achieved until 14 days after symptom onset 28 immunoglobulin ig m titers against sars-cov-2 may be present in as short as a few days from symptom onset and igg titers may exist for weeks or longer 24 some serological assays can also be performed with a minimum amount of blood derived from a simple finger prick finally serological assays can identify patients who have already recovered from disease if current reports hold true that cases of re-infection are few such tests could potentially allow preferential deployment of previously exposed healthcare workers to operate in high risk settings though the correlation between antibodies and protection remains controversial see below convalescent patients also hold the potential to be donors for passive immunization or serum-transfer therapies and such assays can be valuable screening tools for this purpose 29 however care should be taken when using serological assays in immunocompromised patients as some may not mount a humoral immune response capable of generating antibodies the standard type of assay for detecting antiviral antibodies in serum is an indirect elisa fig 2a 7 30 which involves initially adding sera or dilutions of sera to wells of a plastic plate containing prebound viral antigens these antigens bind only the antigen-specific antibodies found within the serum and retain them when the plate is washed the antigen-bound antibody is later detected with an enzyme-linked secondary antibody which binds to general host antibody or to host antibody of a specific isotype eg igg igm the plate is then developed with a colorimetric substrate which the enzyme on the secondary antibody cleaves to cause a color accumulation proportional to the amount of antibody bound during early elisa development many dilutions of the same serum are used to examine the gradient of color intensity optical density od and arbitrary od cutoffs are used to determine the titer or minimum dilution factor needed for the od to exceed background signal however as these assays become perfected for diagnostic use they must be calibrated to provide accurate positive and negative results elisa-type assays can also be adapted to run on the surface of paramagnetic beads rather than plastic plates such technologies are suitable for processing in automated high throughput commercial instruments that also use sensitive chemiluminescent detection systems additionally as monoclonal antibodies specific to sars-cov-2 are developed the format of the elisa can be flipped to allow direct detection of antigens from nasopharyngeal specimens this has recently been accomplished by quidel which has received eua of its antigen sandwich elisa test httpswwwfdagovmedia137885download with a clinical sensitivity of 80 relative to qpcr the specifics of antigen tests are not covered in this review many commercial tests have adapted the principles of the elisa into rapid and simple immunochromatographic assays such as lateral-flow assays lfa 31 these assays can be single or multistep but all involve added serum and reactants traveling across a linear membrane by capillary action traveling through different detection regions this eliminates the need for separate washing steps and permits multiplexing to allow detection of more than one antibody isotype in a single test in one type of single-step lfa fig 2b 32 serum antibodies first flow through an area where those specific to the virus pickup free viral antigen that are conjugated to a detection molecule such as colloidal gold these coupled antibodies as well as the nonreactive ones then pass over an area with discrete bands of immobilized secondary antibodies that capture sera antibodies of specific isotypes presence of the detection molecule at a particular band which causes a color change indicates that sera antibodies of that particular isotype also successfully bind antigen fig 3 alternatively lfas with multiple channels may contain viral antigen immobilized on a surface which then captures antiviral antibodies complexed to a labeled conjugate antibody while most immunochromatographic assays provide only qualitative results some of them incorporate additional components to allow for increased sensitivity specificity or semiquantitative estimates of antibody levels immunochromatographic assays are ideal for point of care assays because they are easy to use and commonly do not require additional large equipment though they may suffer from decreased performance compared to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa discussed below when designing any binding assay selection of which antigen to test is crucial this selection should consider a variety of factors including antigen availability specificity and concentration as mentioned above antigens such as m and e proteins that are small or less-exposed may prove poor antigens to test immunity for sars-cov-2 next testing with an antigen with conserved epitopes may cause cross-reactivity where antibodies specific to a previous infection such as sars-cov test positive on a test for sars-cov-2 5 24 such cross-reactivity may not matter in the case of the current pandemic as sars-cov is not prevalent amongst most patients nevertheless if the protein or subunit used as the antigen is so conserved that it shares similarity with distant but more endemic viruses such as hku or oc43 antibodies against these viruses could theoretically cause false positive results and limit the specificity of the assay 31 33 such concerns have led some assays to use specific subunits such as s1 or the rbd itself as the antigen as these are most specific and might limit cross-reactivity regardless of the antigen used extensive validation with proper controls is always required to ensure the functional use of any assay once an assay is developed it must then be tested and calibrated in the clinical setting determining a diagnostic cutoff can be challenging because over time humans are exposed to numerous infectious agents that may exhibit varying degrees of antigenic similarity many commercial infectious disease serological assays use a reactive control that is validated by comparing individuals known to have infection with an uninfected control group this requires use of a reference method to distinguish the two populations in a quantitative assay the od or signal of the patients serum is compared with the signal of the reactive control to generate an index index values greater than 1 are then interpreted as reactive or positive because of the novelty of sars-cov-2 and the lack of an official gold standard to reference these tests diagnostic cutoffs for these assays are likely to evolve however over time as these assays are used and compared with clinical progression more accurate cutoffs will eventually be calibrated as of may 16 2020 the fda has granted emergency use authorization for 12 tests that detect antibodies igmigg or igg only against sars-cov-2 this group includes 10 kit manufacturers or reference laboratories one academic laboratory and a state health department in addition nearly 200 manufacturers had notified the fda that they have validated and are offering serology tests as set forth in section ivd of the fdas emergency policy for diagnostic tests for covid-2019 httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesfaqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2 only 6 of these assays have been listed as fda authorized the others many of which are rapid-type assays have been listed as not fda authorized pending submission of validation data to the fda for an eua application there is little published data describing the performance characteristics of most of these assays however the fda has begun publishing reported measures of sensitivity specificity positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv for serology tests that have an eua httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-deviceseua-authorized-serology-test-performance one recent study evaluated 10 lfas and two elisas that had not yet been given eua by the fda 33 among specimens from sars-cov-2 rt-pcr-positive individuals the percentage of seropositive specimens increased with time interval peaking at 82100 in samples taken 20 days after symptom onset test specificity ranged from 84 to 100 in pre-covid-19 specimens the majority demonstrated a specificity greater than 95 but only three had a specificity 99 33 it should be noted that despite high apparent sensitivities and specificities the current low prevalence of sars-cov-2 has significant effects on the ppv of these tests for example if a test has 95 sensitivity and 99 specificity and 5 of the population has had a covid-19 infection the ppv would be 83 if the specificity is instead 95 the ppv drops to 50 while antibody tests can accurately detect viral exposure they may be less helpful in identifying or detecting the presence of neutralizing antibodies that can prevent the virus from infecting host cells and therefore confer immunity for example while anti-np antibodies may correlate with protection against infection as well as with the presence of anti-s antibodies assays that detect sars-cov-2 anti-np antibodies cannot directly detect neutralizing antibodies which most likely bind s protein 34 in addition the s protein of sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses can flip between open and closed conformations and their rbds can be masked by the presence of glycan sugars surrounding them 6 35 such features can cause the infected host to synthesize decoy antibodies that bind the s protein but do not affect infectivity as a result the presence of binding antibody and protection against infection is not always correlated indeed one study found a negative correlation where high antibodies against sars-cov-2 were found in the sickest patients 25 therefore testing of antibody correlates of protection against sars-cov-2 and other viruses requires more informative tests namely the use of viral inhibition assays in a basic viral inhibition assay also known as a plaque reduction neutralization test prnt monolayers of cultured cells are exposed to live virus mixed with sera fig 4a 30 after an incubation period the cells are checked for signs on infection such as the presence of multinucleated syncytia on microscopy 8 or the expression of viral proteins on the infected host surface which can be identified with fluorescent detection antibodies 30 the numbers of infected cells in plates exposed to virus and sera are then compared with that of plates exposed to virus alone with the hope that plates exposed to virus with sera have fewer infections such assays can also use dilutions of sera to quantify the minimum titer that can inhibit the number of infected cells by a certain percentage such as 50 fig 4b these minimum titers are then reported as the inhibitory dose or id eg id50 while traditional viral inhibition assays are prohibitively difficult for natural sars-cov-2 which must be handled in biohazard safety level 3 conditions these assays can be easily modified with current technologies to provide safer and easier study settings 30 the virus itself can be attenuated by genetic modification or alternatively its proteins expressed in a less-virulent nonhuman pseudotyped viral vector 8 these pseudotyped virions can be used to infect nonhuman cell lines that express the correct receptor additionally the packaging of genes encoding fluorophores or enzymes into these virions and cell lines can also allow the identification of infection by fluorescence or bioluminescence which can be automated this automation can be used through the use of plate readers that optically measure bulk signal in each cell culture well or alternatively through flow cytometry where individual cells in a culture mix are passed sequentially through a detector that counts the exact percentage of cells that either carry an infection marker or remain uninfected thanks to protection by serum antibodies 30 35 it is important to note that host factors and population heterogeneity can contribute significantly to variability in cross-reactivity and neutralization efficacy of convalescent sera studies in animal models using genetically-attenuated virus 35 can create antibodies that neutralize both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 while human sera samples may only neutralize one species 4 some antibodies may also promote antibody-mediated enhancement of infection at insufficient concentrations 36 these differences stem from the fact that host responses differ based on genetics and other factors patient serum responses are also polyclonal containing antibodies that recognize several different antigens all at different relative concentrations as a result randomized clinical trials to test the efficacy of convalescent plasma will be required and testing of convalescent plasma should be done to quantify in-vitro neutralizing efficacy future prospective monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov-2 could provide a more consistent therapeutic response 37 however such antibodies require rigorous testing and may require combination with additional monoclonal antibodies to be efficacious such endeavors cannot be scaled quickly in time to meet current demand nucleic acid amplification technology pcr assays and serological assays are both important components in current efforts to diagnose treat and limit the spread of sars-cov-2 as outlined in this review providers should be aware of the strengths and limitations of individual assays qpcr will remain the gold standard for diagnosing acute infection and will assist diagnoses of immunocompromised patients serological tests can aid in diagnosing late acute infections and will be important for diagnosing previously undiagnosed resolved infections high-capacity elisa-type serological assays will be essential in the coming months to assess the extent of infection in the community information that is needed to help guide options for relaxing isolation restrictions lastly neutralization assays will be vital in testing potential plasma donors and monoclonal antibodies as viable treatment options ultimately all of these different assays need optimization to provide accurate results and need to be scaled up to meet global demand  serological evidence of mers-cov and hku8-related cov co-infection in kenyan camels wei zhang xiao-shuang zheng bernard agwanda sheila

mortality of 354 as of february 2019 1  the who recommendation for laboratory detection of the causal agent mers coronavirus mers-cov includes real-time rtpcr targeting upstream of the e protein gene or nucleocapsid protein np gene complemented with orf1a and orf1b 2 serological tests are also recommended when a viral nucleic acid test was not applicable or for population-based serosurveys and investigations of past exposures viral spike s protein-based indirect elisa followed by a confirmatory virus neutralization test vnt is the mostly widely used serological test for mers-cov in contrast np based serological assays are seldom used because of their greater cross-reactivity 27 tracing the source of human mers infection is pivotal to prevent transmission of this disease dromedary camels have been identified as an important source for zoonotic transmission of mers-cov after detection of neutralizing antibodies 76100 seropositive and almost identical viruses were identified in middle east camels 38 it is widely believed that mers-cov could have originated from africa as most of these animals were originally bred and exported from africa 9 although mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and viral rna have been found in camels from west and east african countries zoonotic human infections have not been reported in africa 491011 the majority of these studies used an s-based serosurvey and showed high positivity for mers-cov infection in camels 348911 there are two studies which have previously tested both s and np igg antibodies in middle east camels of the two studies one reported a strong correlation between np positives by western blot 97 and s-based vnt positives 98 using camel samples from the united arab emirates 12 the second study tested camel sera from saudi arabia and found more samples seropositive for s than np by elisa western blot or the luciferase immunoprecipitation system lips 13 the latter study did not proceed with further analysis in this study we conducted a nationwide serosurvey for coronavirus infection from samples first screened for mers-cov by elisa and vnt 14 our aim was to investigate the possible new genotype of mers-cov in kenyan camels using a serology-predicted pathogen discovery strategy the director of veterinary service at the ministry of agriculture livestock and fisheries in kenya granted permission to conduct this study the camel sampling was performed in 2016 and 2018 across 13 counties where camels are reared taking into account breed types 14 four distinct breeds of camel are recognized in kenya somali turkana gabbrarendille and imported pakistani which were imported from pakistan in the 1980s the sampling locations were recorded and confirmed by gps other information such as age sex pregnancy and migration was collected a total of 894 camel serum samples were used in this study in addition 1136 camel nasal swabs collected in januaryfebruary 2016 and 286 camel nasal swabs collected in februarymarch 2018 were used for molecular tests all camel samples were collected in compliance with local regulations and then transported to wuhan institute of virology wiv according to iata international regulations for transporting biological samples 14 an in-house anti-mers-cov igg elisa kit was developed based on the purified receptor-binding domain rbd of spike protein and validated for kenya and pakistan camels 1415 purified np of mers-cov sars-like cov rp3 human coronaviruses oc43 hku1 229e and nl63 and bat covs hku2 and hku9 were produced and applied to elisa or western blot

after validation lysates of mers-cov infected vero cells were generated in the biosafety level 3 laboratory at wiv loaded onto 12 sds-page gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes membranes were incubated with selected mers-cov rbd positive and np positive or negative camel sera for 1 h at 37c 1100 dilution after blocking membranes were then washed and then incubated with anti-camel

suspension pierce thermo fisher scientific the ratio of rluc-n or s1 rluc vector was used to determine the specific antigen reactivity of camel sera hku8r-cov s1 protein was expressed from the pcaggs vector and was purified using s-tag resin generated in-house mouse anti-serum against purified protein was used as a positive control in lips viral rna was extracted from camel nasal swabs using a viral rna extraction kit roche germany according to the manufacturers instructions three primer pairs were used to screen the samples in rtpcr two targeting the conserved rna-dependent rna polymerase gene of covs and another targeting the mers-cov s2 region 2021 twelve pools of rna were made from 139 mers-cov negative samples roughly every 10 samples were pooled and libraries for next-generation sequencing were prepared using illumina truseq mrna kit truseq stranded mrna library prep kit cat  rs-122-2101 following the manufacturers instructions the sequencing was performed on a hiseq 3000 sequencer and data was analysed using the galaxy platform all analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 25 two-tailed mannwhitney u exact test and two-tailed students t exact test were used to calculate the 95 confidence interval ci of positive rate the association p values between viral seropositive samples and camel information were calculated using chi-square test followed with yates correction two-tailed test and fishers exact test we previously performed a nationwide serosurvey for mers-cov in kenyan camels using an in-house mers-cov rbd igg elisa plus a confirmatory vnt 14 a correlation in results obtained using the two methods was observed whereby almost all elisa positive sera were capable of neutralizing mers-cov 103105 981 our data revealed 584 of 891 6554 kenyan camel samples had mers-cov rbd antibodies figure 1a we then tested all camel sera using a mers-cov np-based elisa in contrast only 54 of 891 samples 604 or 48 of the rbd positive samples 822 were np positive figure 1a to confirm the finding we developed an additional antibody assay based on mammalian expressed mers-cov np using lips a fast and sensitive serological tool which has previously been successfully used in sads-cov serosurvey 1819 all np elisa positive sera were also positive in lips while those negative samples remained negative figure 1b this observation was confirmed by a mers-cov virus-based western blot using rbd positive samples two major structural proteins np and membrane protein were observed in the np positive group but not in the np negative group figure 1c and supplementary figure 1a above all only a small proportion of the mers-cov rbd positive serum samples were also np positive different to that observed in human infection cases 622 this observation indicated that the majority of the camels may only maintain np antibodies for a short time or be co-infected by another cov
 in searching for possible new genotype of mers viruses that share the same or a related s but a different np we performed a cov np protein array serology test selected mers-cov rbd positive samples were analysed by western blot using np proteins from representative alpha and beta covs see method section the successful expression of these proteins was confirmed by anti-tag antibodies figure 2a no other cov besides hku8r-cov china strain np was detected in two out of three selected mers-cov np negative camel serum samples figure 2a and supplementary figure 1b in particular hku8r-cov np antibody was not cross-reactive with 229e-related cov which is also known to be enzootic in camels figure 2a hku8r-cov has previously been found only in miniopterus bats in china or kenya 2325
 to further investigate the results observed in the western blot hku8r-cov np and s1 based lips assays were developed the lips results demonstrated clear hku8r-cov np positive in some camel sera consistent with western blot results figure 2b however no hku8r-cov s1 positives were found within the hku8r-cov np positive samples figure 2b to rule out the possible false-negative results using china hku8r-cov as detection antigen a kenyan bat hku8r-cov btky33 was also used results indicated that the above conclusion was not hku8r-cov strain-specific supplementary figure 2 the data indicates that some of the kenyan camels have both mers-cov s and hku8r-cov np antibodies we then performed a nationwide serosurvey for hku8r-cov in camels using a hku8r-cov np and s1 elisa of the 584 mers-cov rbd positive samples tested 73 125 were positive for hku8r-cov np figure 2c in contrast only 3 051 were seropositive for hku8r-cov s1 figure 2c the data suggested the idea of the co-infection of mershku8r-covs alternatively we cant rule out the existence of a chimeric mers-cov carrying mers-cov s gene but a np gene from hku8r-cov in kenyan camels figure 3 and supplementary table 1 although we cannot rule the possibility of a novel cov that was not detected in molecular assays but can cross-react with hku8r or mers coronavirus positive serum samples it is worth to mention another camel alphacoronaviruses 229e-like coronaviruses were previously found in camels 26 we then tested cross-reactivity of antibodies to the n proteins of hku8r and 229e as the two are closely related phylogenetically our data demonstrated only 1090 of the hku8r-cov np positive camel serum were also 229e-np positive supplementary figure 3a which was probably true positive for the later as np of the two viruses showed no cross-reactivity using positive control samples supplementary figure 3b
 we then investigated factors that may associate with mers-cov positive for both s and np seropositivity and distribution which may also be important for the detection of this mershku8r-cov co-infection cases distribution of mers-cov sero-positive samples was not found to be associated with sex age birthplace migration or pregnancy of camels but may be associated with the breed p  003 supplementary table 2 we also screened nucleic acid by rtpcr targeting the conserved regions of all known coronaviruses on 1422 camel nasal swabs collected from kenya 20162018 in addition 12 pooled camel nasal swabs 10 samples for each pool rna were also tested in next-generation sequencing ngs we found mers-cov nucleic acid by both rtpcr and ngs yet so far we have not found nucleic acid positive for hku8r-coronavirus in a nationwide mers-cov sero-surveillance of kenyan camels we have demonstrated that most of the mers-cov rbd positive samples 9178 were not mers-cov np positive by multiple serological assays in contrast 125 of the mers-cov rbd positive samples also carried np antibodies to hku8r-cov a virus that has only so far been found in bats for the first time we demonstrate the presence of a hku8r-cov infection in camels our study is the first to compare the seroprevalence of mers-cov in camels using both s and np serological assays as one of the four major structural proteins in cov np is widely used as a diagnostic target due to its high abundance upon infection although np showed good reactivity with human mers patient serum in some studies s-based serological tests are recommended by who for diagnosis due to its greater specificity 2 in line with these recommendations most camel serosurveys were conducted using only s-based assays 3891113 in human cases samples showing neutralizing activity were also np positive 622 however our data clearly demonstrate that most of the mers-cov neutralizing samples were not mers-cov np positive in camels similarly unmatched s and np positive serological patterns have also been observed in another study using saudi arabia camel serum samples 13 a possible interpretation is that the duration of the np antibody responses is more short-lived than s antibody in camels the seropositive of hku8r-cov in camels is another example linking a bat cov to camels besides mers-cov and 229e-related coronavirus thereby strengthening the bat-camel connection theory 2728 the finding of two closely related neocov and predictpdf-2180 cov in bats suggested that mers-cov descended from an ancestral virus of african bats while the host switch from bats to dromedary camels likely occurred in africa years ago 272930 however there has been no other reported virus spillover from bats to camels beside this ancestral mers-cov and 229e-related coronaviruses our data demonstrated that the hku8r-cov np antibody is not caused by cross-reactive antibody responses to camel 229e our discovery of hku8r-cov in camels is therefore an important finding hku8r-cov was described first in hong kong and later in kenya and so far it has only been reported in miniopterus bat species 2325 kenyan bats carry multiple covs including sars-related hku2-related hku7-related hku8-related and hku9-related covs that may spillover to other species in rural areas where bats roost in close proximity to humans or are consumed by humans as bush meat 24 it is worth mentioning that we observed much less hku8r-cov s protein igg antibodies in any of the hku8r-cov np positive and mers-cov rbd positive samples the chance of mershku8r-cov co-infected camels simultaneously lost both hku8r-cov s and mers-cov np antibodies should be low the presence of a chimeric mershku8r-cov would be a possible explanation although there could be other explanations for example camel may generate a different s and np antibody responses that resulted in a stronger s but weak and short-lasting np antibody titres it could also be two separated events of infection by mers-cov and hku8r-cov instead of a co-infection nonetheless even the occurrence of a chimeric mershku8r-cov is not surprising as it is known that cov genomes regularly undergo recombination during infection as observed in covs such as bat sars-related covs 31 three covs including mers-cov 229e-like and hku23-cov had also been reported to co-circulate in middle east camels increased chance of recombination 28 yet it is worth noting that recombination between an alpha-cov hku8r-cov eg and beta-cov mers-cov eg has never been reported our observation should be more supported by molecular evidence in future studies molecular detection of these serology-predicted novel covs containing mers-cov s protein is hampered by the lack of genetic sequences of this possible recombinant virus at the present time our western blot results suggest at least some of the mers-cov neutralizing samples did not have np or m protein antibodies it is unknown what genetic backbone these viruses will have for example viruses may maintain the mers-cov backbone and only replace the np gene with hku8r-cov or unidentified covs or vice versa in the latter example these viruses would have a hku8r-cov backbone with s gene replaced by the mers-cov with this hypothesis in consideration the current molecular diagnosis tools for mers-cov do not detect other genotype of mers-covs circulating in animals partially explaining the failure in our attempt to find molecular evidence of novel chimeric covs using qpcr targeting mers-cov s gene or metagenome ngs concerted efforts to identify and sequence these viruses are needed in future studies in conclusion we showed evidence for hku8r-cov virus infection in camels in kenya it is possible that this virus co-circulates with mers-cov but the possibility of a mers-cov-hku8r recombinant virus cannot be excluded future research should seek to demonstrate molecular evidence of such viruses  evaluation of

current standard rna-based tests  the recent coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak has been classified as a 2 global pandemic on march 12 2020 which continues to pose a great threat to global 3 public health the disease is caused by a novel coronavirus called 2019-ncov by the 4 world health organization at the beginning of the outbreak and latterly severe acute 5 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the ictv international 6 committee on taxonomy of viruses 1  however this name is prone to confusion 7 with sars-cov which emerged in 2003 and a suggestion for a distinct name was 8 proposed human coronavirus 2019 hcov-19 2  this novel virus is potentially 9 more transmissible than sars-cov and other coronavirus 3 making early 10 diagnosis of it important for clinical treatment and disease control however the 11 current nucleic acid testing approach for hcov-19 4 carries a negligible 12 false-negative risk 5  serological assays are supposedly a powerful approach for 13 achieving timely diagnosis of covid-19 as is nucleic acid testing especially for 14 patients with undetectable viral rna 6  the serological assays used for early 15 diagnosis are mainly based on detecting specific antibodies against hcov-19 in a 16 patients serum and include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa the 17 colloidal gold immunochromatography assay gica and the

parasitic organisms of dogs and cats that may lead to a presumptive or definitive diagnosis cytologic evaluation of exudates bone marrow aspirates blood smears synovial fluid gastric brushings duodenal secretions urine prostatic washings airway washings fecal smears tissue imprints skin scrapings and aspiration biopsies is inexpensive and is considered a primary diagnostic procedure for many clinical infectious diseases stains routinely used for the diagnosis of infectious agents in small animal practice include wrights-giemsa diff-quik acid-fast and gram stains the laboratory should be contacted for specific specimen handling information based on the suspected organism cytological findings can be used to achieve a definitive diagnosis for some infectious agents for example identification of cryptococcus spp organisms on cytological evaluation of a lymph node aspirate from a cat with rhinitis confirms the diagnosis detection of a hemoplasma on cytological examination of a thin blood smear from an anemic cat or dog confirms the diagnosis polymerase chain reaction pcr assays can then be used to determine whether the organism is mycoplasma hemofelis m hemocanis or another one of the agents in the genus some infectious agents can be present in small numbers so failure to document an organism cytologically does not totally exclude the diagnosis low npv ehrlichia spp infections are examples of common infectious agents rarely documented cytologically these agents generally require results of serology and pcr to confirm exposure or current infection some organisms like respiratory mycoplasma spp are rarely documented cytologically because of their small size whereas other organisms require special stains for optimal visualization for example mycobacterium spp are not readily stained by rapid stains used in small animal practices and if macrophages or neutrophils are detected acid-fast staining is indicated to assess for the organisms within the cytoplasm of infected cells bacterial culture of all samples with increased numbers of neutrophils or macrophages should always be considered bacteria fungi viruses and some protozoans can be cultured in general a positive culture can be used to establish a definitive diagnosis particularly if there is clinical illness and concurrent evidence of inflammation if the organism is easy to grow primarily bacteria culture is preferred over cytology or molecular diagnostic assays because culture may be combined with antimicrobial susceptibility testing to determine optimal antibiotic therapy successful culture is dependent on the collection of optimal materials without contamination and on transportation of materials in the most appropriate culture medium to the laboratory as quickly as possible to minimize organism death and nonpathogen overgrowth culture results of body systems with normal bacterial and fungal flora including the skin ears mouth nasal cavity trachea feces and vagina are the most difficult to interpret positive-culture results coupled with cytological evidence of inflammation suggest the organism is inducing disease culture of a single agent particularly if the organism is relatively resistant to antimicrobials is more consistent with a disease-inducing infection than if multiple antibiotic-susceptible bacteria are cultured for some organisms culture is difficult or has never been accomplished for example the hemoplasmas of dogs and cats previously hemobartonella felis and h canis can be detected on the surface of red blood cells but have never been successfully cultured for other organisms culture takes several weeks to become positive ie bartonella spp or the techniques are cumbersome and not so widely available ie ehrlichia spp in these situations molecular diagnostic assays may be the optimal way to prove current infection examination of feces can be used to identify bacteria fungi and parasites that can be associated with diseases of the gastrointestinal table 1 and respiratory table 2 tracts the techniques used most frequently include direct saline solution and stained smears fecal flotation and the baermann technique the american association of feline practitioners wwwcatvetscom recommends performing at least a fecal flotation fecal or rectal cytology and direct smear on feces from cats with potentially infectious diarrhea2 these assays can easily be performed in the veterinary clinic the companion animal parasite council is an excellent source of information concerning these assays and the parasites that infest dog and cats wwwcapcvetorg infectious agents or their antigens can be detected in body fluids feces cells or tissues with immunologic techniques in general polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against the agent in question are used in a variety of different test methodologies including direct fluorescent antibody assay with cells or tissue agglutination assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa the sensitivity and specificity will vary among tests but are generally high for most assays the npv of most assays is high if performed on appropriate samples ie pretreatment positive results with these tests generally confirm infection however the ppv for disease varies by the agent and the assay for example many normal dogs and cats are positive for giardia antigen in feces and so a positive assay result in an animal with diarrhea does not prove disease causation in the united states commercially available antigen assays used most frequently for the detection of antigens in serum or plasma include blastomyces dermatitidis cryptococcus neoformans dirofilaria immitis and feline leukemia virus felv the cryptococcus neoformans latex agglutination procedure can also be performed on aqueous humor vitreous humor and cerebrospinal fluid csf cryptosporidium parvum antigen giardia spp antigen parvovirus antigen and clostridium perfringens and c difficile enterotoxin assays are available for use with feces parvovirus assays detect both canine and feline parvovirus antigen and may be positive transiently after administration of modified live vaccines3 4 most giardia antigen tests marketed for use with human feces and the test labeled for use with dog or cat feces detect the giardia assemblages that infect dogs or cats5 occasionally samples will be antigen-positive but cyst-negative on fecal flotation in this situation it is unknown whether the antigen test is falsely positive or the fecal flotation is falsely negative none of the currently available c parvum antigen tests marketed for use with human feces consistently detects c felis or c canis and so should not be used with feces from dogs and cats however a direct fluorescent antibody assay for human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis detects dog and cat strains and is available at most commercial laboratories clostridium spp enterotoxins can be detected in the stool of healthy dogs and dogs with diarrhea and so the ppv is 1006
 immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical techniques are commercially available for the documentation of a variety of infectious disease agents these procedures are particularly valuable for the detection of viral diseases detection of agents present in small numbers and differentiation among agents with similar morphologic features tissues collected from animals with suspected infectious diseases can be evaluated by several different techniques for example focal feline infectious peritonitis granulomatous disease can be documented by immunohistochemical staining7 tissue samples should be aseptically placed in appropriate transport media for culture procedures or inoculated into laboratory animals if indicated before further handling gently blotting the cut edge of the tissue on a paper towel to remove excess blood and then lightly touching the tissue multiple times to a microscope slide make tissue impressions for cytological or immunocytological examination tissue specimens can then be frozen placed into 10 buffered formalin solution or placed into glutaraldehyde-containing solutions frozen specimens are generally superior for immunohistochemical staining and pcr routine histopathologic evaluation is performed on formalin-fixed tissues special stains can be used to maximize the identification of some infectious agents the clinician should alert the histopathology laboratory to the infectious agents most suspected to allow for appropriate stain selection glutaraldehyde-containing fixatives are superior to other fixatives for electron microscopic examination of tissues and this technique can be more sensitive than other procedures for demonstration of viral particles assays to amplify dna and rna of infectious agents are among the newest organism demonstration techniques now commonly available to veterinary practitioners pcr assays are used to amplify small quantities of dna to detectable levels by use of a reverse transcriptase rt step rna is converted to dna therefore the technique can also be used to detect rna rt-pcr in general pcr is more sensitive than cytologic or histopathologic techniques and is comparable with culture and laboratory animal inoculation pcr assays are of great benefit for documentation of infections particularly if the organism in question is difficult to culture eg respiratory mycoplasma spp or cannot be cultured eg hemoplasmas specificity can be very high depending on the primers used in the reaction for example primers can be designed to detect one genus but not others primers can also be designed to identify only one species for example a pcr assay can be developed to detect all ehrlichia spp or just one species such as e canis because of the inherent sensitivity of the reaction pcr can give false-positive results if sample contamination occurs during collection or at the laboratory performing the procedure false-negative results can occur if the sample is handled inappropriately this is of particular importance for detection of some rna viruses by rt-pcr results may also be affected by treatment and it is therefore best to collect samples before administration of antimicrobial agents another potential problem is that minimal standardization exists among commercial laboratories offering pcr techniques and results may therefore vary between laboratories in addition minimal external quality control exists and so the veterinary practitioner must trust that the laboratory providing the assay is using appropriate controls although pcr assays can be one of the most sensitive for documentation of infections positive test results do not always prove that the infection is resulting in clinical illness low ppv for example because the technique detects dna of both live and dead organisms positive test results may be achieved even if the infection has been controlled interpretation of test results for a single animal can be difficult if the targeted organism commonly infects the background population of healthy animals for example candidatus mycoplasma haemominutum dna can be amplified from approximately 15 of all cats whether anemic or healthy8 9 thus although pcr is the most sensitive way to document infection by this agent the ppv is actually very low in addition currently available pcr assays cannot discriminate between vaccine and field strains for some agents for example currently available pcr assays for fhv-1 also amplify modified live vaccine strains so a positive result does not even indicate presence of a pathogenic strain10 real-time pcr can be used to determine the amount of microbial dna in a sample it is possible that the dna load will correlate to the presence of disease for some agents based on these findings it is very important that small animal practitioners carefully assess the predictive values of currently available pcr assays as well as the expertise and reliability of the laboratory that will be performing the assays new pcr assays are being developed frequently but may not be required or optimal except for many canine and feline infectious disease agents the clinical use of commonly available pcr assays will be discussed throughout this article a variety of different methods exist for detecting serum antibodies against infectious agents including complement fixation hemagglutination inhibition serum neutralization agglutination agar gel immunodiffusion indirect fluorescent antibody ifa elisa and western blot assays complement fixation hemagglutination inhibition serum neutralization and agglutination assays generally detect all antibody classes in a serum sample western blot immunoassay ifa and elisa can be adapted to detect specific immunoglobulin ig m igg or iga responses comparison of igm iga and igg antibody responses against an infectious agent can be used to attempt to demonstrate recent or active infection in general igm is the first antibody produced after antigenic exposure with antibody class shift to igg occurring in days to weeks serum and mucosal iga immune responses have also been studied for some infectious agents including toxoplasma gondii feline coronaviruses and helicobacter felis
 timing of antibody testing is important in general serum antibody tests in puppies and kittens cannot be interpreted as specific responses until at least 8 to 12 weeks of age because of the presence of antibodies from the dam passed to the puppy or kitten in the colostrum most infectious agents can induce disease within 3 to 10 days after initial exposure with the use of many assays serum igg antibodies are usually not detected until 1 to 2 weeks after initial exposure based on these facts falsely negative serum antibody tests during acute disease can be common in small animal practice if specific serum antibody testing is initially negative in an animal with acute disease repeat antibody testing should be performed in 2 to 3 weeks to assess for seroconversion documentation of increasing antibody titers is consistent with recent or active infection it is preferable to assess both the acute and convalescent sera in the same assay on the same day to avoid interassay variation diagnostic use of some serologic tests are also limited because of the presence of antibodies induced by vaccination examples include feline coronaviruses some borrelia burgdorferi assays fhv-1 parvoviruses calicivirus and canine distemper virus the clinician should interpret positive results in serum antibody tests only as evidence of present or prior infection by the agent in question recent or active infection is suggested by the presence of igm an increasing antibody titer over 2 to 3 weeks or seroconversion negative antibody result on the first test and positive antibody result on convalescent testing however detection of recent infection based on antibody testing does not always prove disease because of the agent in question conversely failure to document recent or active infection based on serologic testing does not exclude a diagnosis of clinical disease for example many cats with toxoplasmosis develop clinical signs of disease after serum antibody titers have reached their plateau the magnitude of antibody titer does not always correlate with active or clinical disease for example many cats with clinical toxoplasmosis have igm and igg titers that are at the low end of the titer scale conversely many healthy cats have igg titers greater than 116384 years after infection with toxoplasma gondii
 some infectious agents induce disease of the eyes or central nervous system cns documentation of agent-specific antibodies in aqueous humor vitreous humor or csf can be used to support the diagnosis of infection of these tissues quantification of ocular and csf antibodies is difficult to interpret if serum antibodies and inflammatory disease are present serum antibodies leak into ocular fluids and csf in the face of inflammation detection of local production of antibodies within the eye or cns has been used to aid in a number of infectious agents including canine distemper virus infection feline toxoplasmosis and feline bartonellosis11 12
 in summary there are organism demonstration techniques or antibody assays available for many infectious disease agents in pets with variable predictive values results of infectious agent assays should not be interpreted alone but should be combined with other parameters to document a clinical infectious disease includingappropriate signalment history and physical examination findingsclinical signs referable to the agentpositive cytology culture antigen assay pcr assay or serologic evidence of exposure to the agentexclusion of other causes of the clinical syndrome andresponse to treatment
 the infectious disease agent in question is the likely cause of the clinical syndrome when these criteria are met however it is possible that the clinical syndrome may have spontaneously resolved during the treatment period in addition many antimicrobial drugs have other nonspecific effects for example doxycycline has antiinflammatory properties and so some apparent clinical responses may not have been from the antibiotic activity13
 the purpose of the remaining part of the article is to use several common infectious disease agents to emphasize important points concerning use of molecular diagnostic assays in practice the new names for hemobartonella felis are mycoplasma hemofelis candidatus mycoplasma haemominutum and candidatus m turicensis the new names for h canis are m hemocanis and candidatus m hematoparvum in cats m hemofelis is apparently more pathogenic than candidatus m haemominutum and candidatus m turicensis however fever and anemia have been documented in all 3 species in dogs the hemoplasmas are generally only associated with disease if the dog is immunosuppressed diagnosis of hemoplasma infections in dogs and cats is based on demonstration of the organism on the surface of erythrocytes on examination of a thin blood film or pcr assay organism numbers fluctuate and therefore blood film examination can be falsely negative 50 of the time8 the organism may be difficult to find cytologically particularly in the chronic phase thus pcr assays are the tests of choice because of sensitivity particularly if the cytological examination is negative both conventional and quantitative pcr assays are available and have similar sensitivity specificity and predictive values unfortunately dna copy numbers do not correlate to the presence of disease for the hemoplasmas however quantitative pcr assays can be used to monitor dna copy numbers during antimicrobial drug research studies samples should be obtained for pcr assays before antibiotics treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone may be indicated if any of the agents are detected by pcr in cats or dogs with fever or anemia additionally the american college of veterinary internal medicine recommends screening blood donor dogs or cats by hemoplasma pcr assays14 there is minimal clinical utility after hemoplasma pcr assay results because most animals do not become negative with treatment dogs in the united states are known to be infected by ehrlichia canis e ewingii e chaffeensis anaplasma phagocytophilum a platys and neorickettsia risticii15 each of these agents can result in fever and cytopenias and the clinical syndrome is collectively known as ehrlichiosis the primary agent in the united states is e canis because of the distribution of rhipicephalus sanguineous whereas the prevalence of the other agents varies geographically cats may be infected by e canis-like organisms as well as by a phagocytophilum16 17 little is known about the other agents in these genera in regards to cats because the organisms are in different genera serological cross reactivity is variable thus although the clinical syndromes can be similar there is no single serological test to document all the infections and other than the commercially available kit there is no standardization among laboratories offering serology in addition some cats with e canis-like infection do not seroconvert16 dogs and cats with ehrlichiosis can be clinically ill before seroconversion cytological assessment of blood smears is usually negative and culture is expensive has poor sensitivity and is not readily available thus pcr assays for ehrlichia spp anaplasma spp and perhaps n risticii atypical ehrlichiosis in dogs should be performed on blood of dogs and cats with acute fever or cytopenias before treatment pcr assays can be designed to amplify each individual organism and can be offered in panels alternately primers are available to amplify all of the organisms in a single reaction and subsequent sequencing can be used to determine the infective species the predictive value of these pcr assays is currently unknown however it seems prudent to treat a clinically ill pcr-positive dog or cat dogs with ehrlichiosis can be followed by pcr to prove cure however infection can reoccur and so tick control should be maintained15 minimal information concerning the clinical use of repeated pcr testing of cats with these infections is available blood donors should be screened for ehrlichiaanaplasmaneorickettsia and if positive excluded from the program even if treated because of the difficulty in sterilizing the blood14
 some dogs become clinically ill after exposure to rickettsia rickettsii and there are an additional 4 spotted fever group organisms in the united states that induce cross-reacting antibodies therefore antibodies against r rickettsii do not prove rocky mountain spotted fever cats can be infected by r felis and have demonstrated antibodies against r rickettsii we assayed 92 pairs of cat blood and flea extracts from alabama maryland and texas in a recent study in our laboratory we used pcr assays that amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene and the outer membrane protein b gene18 of the 92 pairs 62 of 92 674 flea extracts and none of the cat blood samples were positive for r felis dna in another study we identified r felis and r rickettsii antibody prevalence rates in cats with fever to be 56 and 66 respectively however neither organism was amplified from blood19 these results proved that cats were sometimes exposed but further data are required to determine the significance of disease associations rickettsia spp dna has been amplified from healthy dogs but the infective species are currently unknown20 the predictive values of rickettsia spp pcr assays in clinical syndromes in dogs and cats have not been established blood culture pcr assay on blood and serologic testing can be used to assess dogs or cats for bartonella spp infection21
bartonella vinsonii and b henselae infections are most common in dogs whereas b henselae and b clarridgeiae are most common in cats there are several other less common species that infect dogs and cats and not all of the species induce cross-reacting antibodies thus as for the ehrlichiaanaplasmaneorickettsia group pcr assays that amplify multiple bartonella species can be superior to serology if collected before treatment however a combination of culture and pcr may be required to detect some infections in dogs22 serologic testing can be used to determine whether an individual dog or cat has been exposed however both seropositive and seronegative animals can be bacteremic limiting the diagnostic use of serologic testing thus testing healthy cats or dogs for bartonella species infection is not currently recommended and should be reserved for those with suspected clinical bartonellosis however because bartonella spp infection is so common in healthy animals even positive-culture or pcr results do not prove clinical bartonellosis for example although we detected bartonella spp dna in more cats with fever than pair-matched cats without fever the healthy cats were still commonly positive23 treatment usually does not permanently eliminate infection and so there appears to be minimum clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment 
cytauxzoon felis in clinically affected cats is usually easily identified on cytological examination of blood smears or splenic aspirates serologic testing is not commercially available pcr can be used to amplify organismal dna from blood or splenic aspirates from cytologically negative cats24 nonpathogenic c felis strains can be detected in the blood of healthy cats and therefore the ppv of pcr assays is less than 100 however some strains of the organism are extremely pathogenic and so it seems prudent to institute treatment in clinically ill positive cats whether there is clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment is unknown 
babesia canis and b gibsoni infections occur in dogs of the united states there are no species that infect cats in this country serological assays are available for both organisms but positive test results do not prove anemia from babesia spp infection pcr assays are now commercially available for both organisms these assays should be considered in high-risk dogs with hemolytic anemia-like greyhounds pit bull terriers or dogs exposed to pit bull terriers25 the predictive values of babesia spp pcr assays are unknown but it seems prudent to institute treatment in clinically ill positive dogs it is unknown whether there are clinical benefits to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus fiv are detected in serum in clinical practice most frequently by elisa comparisons between different tests have shown the results of most assays are comparable26 it is believed that infection is incurable once established thus presence of serum antibodies in unvaccinated cats indicates persistent infection clinical signs can occur before seroconversion in some cats and some infected cats never seroconvert thus false-negative reactions can occur results of virus isolation or rt-pcr on blood are positive in some antibody-negative cats virus isolation or rt-pcr on blood can also be performed to confirm infection however fiv is not present in the blood in high levels and so false-negative results are common27 thus the assay is not very accurate for distinguishing a vaccinated cat from a naturally exposed cat most cats with felv infection are antigenemic and therefore molecular diagnostic assays are not usually necessary in clinical practice however the use of newer sensitive rt-pcr assays have been used to accurately characterize the stages of infection although these assays do not have widespread commercial availability28
 rna of both feline infectious peritonitis fip virus and feline enteric coronavirus fecv can be amplified from the blood and feces of cats and so positive test results do not always correlate with the development of fip amplification of the mrna of the m gene by rt-pcr has had mixed results in 2 studies performed to date a study demonstrated that 13 of 26 apparently normal cats were positive for fecv mrna in blood suggesting that the ppv of this assay for the diagnosis of fip was low29
 the primary bacteria associated with gastrointestinal tract disease in cats and dogs include salmonella spp campylobacter spp clostridium spp and helicobacter spp the optimal diagnostic test for salmonella spp and campylobacter spp is culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing rather than pcr although little information is available in cats it appears in dogs that it is optimal to perform a combination of both pcr and enterotoxin assays on feces from those suspected to have c perfringens or c difficile infections30 however some healthy dogs can also be positive in all assays and therefore the ppv is not 100 helicobacter spp infection is suspected on cytological or histopathological detection of gastric spiral organisms and urease-positive test results on tissue biopsies pcr assays can be used to document the presence of helicobacter spp dna in tissues however helicobacter spp can be detected in the tissues of many healthy dogs and cats and therefore the ppv of assays for this organism group is low31 treatment usually does not permanently eliminate gastrointestinal bacterial infections resulting in minimum clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment the most common enteric protozoans in dogs and cats include cryptosporidium spp giardia spp isospora spp and tritrichomonas fetus although infection is common it is unusual to find c felis or c canis after fecal flotation in cats because of the small size of the oocysts acid-fast staining of a thin fecal smear is cumbersome and insensitive and antigen assays that are titrated for use with human feces are inaccurate when used with canine or feline feces immunofluorescent antibody staining of a thin fecal smear with a commercially available kit for the detection of c parvum and g lamblia in people appears to detect most cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp in dog and cat feces this assay is commonly combined with fecal flotation by the author for the initial screening of cats with small bowel diarrhea and dogs with unexplained small bowel diarrhea that persists after routine therapeutic trials pcr assays have been shown to be more sensitive than ifa for detection of c felis in cats but little is known about sensitivity in the dog32 however because of the inherent sensitivity pcr assays are likely to detect a number of subclinical carriers and so the ppv will be less than 100 cryptosporidium felis and c canis are not considered to be significant zoonotic agents therefore positive pcr assay results are only potentially significant when detected in feces of dogs or cats with diarrhea33
cryptosporidium spp pcr assays are indicated in ifa-negative dogs or cats with unexplained small bowel diarrhea and when the genotype of cryptosporidium is to be determined treatment usually does not permanently eliminate infection and so there appears to be minimum clinical benefit to repeating pcr assays after successful treatment the diagnosis of giardia spp infection is easy to achieve in dogs or cats with small bowel diarrhea with the combination of fecal flotation techniques and wet mount examination fecal antigen assays and the giardia ifa are also accurate fecal pcr assays can be inaccurate because of the presence of pcr inhibitors and should only be used when the genotype of giardia is to be determined34 treatment usually does not permanently eliminate giardia infection and reinfection can occur within days thus there appears to be no clinical benefit in testing healthy animals or repeating pcr assays after resolution of diarrhea some kittens and puppies with large bowel diarrhea are infected by toxoplasma fetus rare most clinically affected animals have cytological evidence of infection on wet mount examination in addition the organism is readily cultured from feces however pcr assays can be more sensitive than culture and results return more quickly subclinical carriers are common and therefore amplification of t fetus dna from feces does not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease poor ppv35 treatment may not eliminate infection and reinfection is common thus there appears to be little clinical benefit in testing healthy animals or repeating pcr assays after resolution of diarrhea the primary viral agents associated with gastrointestinal disease in cats include feline coronaviruses feline panleukopenia virus felv and fiv in dogs canine coronavirus canine distemper virus and canine parvoviruses are most common felv and fiv assays are generally performed on blood not feces coronaviruses in dog and cat feces can be documented by electron microscopy virus isolation or molecular assays rt-pcr can be used to detect fecv and fipv rna in feces of cats and canine coronavirus in feces of dogs however positive results do not prove feline infectious peritonitis in cats but merely the presence of a coronavirus36 in addition rt-pcr assay results cannot distinguish a cat or dog that is merely colonized with a coronavirus from one with diarrhea induced by a coronavirus enteric coronaviruses are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens with good husbandry and do not cause diarrhea in adults6 thus there appears to be no reason to routinely perform coronavirus rt-pcr assay on the feces from a dog or cat feline panleukopenia virus and canine parvoviruses can be detected in dog and cat feces by electron microscopy virus isolation canine parvovirus antigen assays and molecular diagnostic assays there appears to be no reason to routinely perform parvovirus pcr assays on canine and feline feces because fecal antigen assays are widely available easy to use and detect current strains of canine and feline parvoviruses4 other organisms like astroviruses and reoviruses may infect some animals but these agents have rarely been associated with disease thus whether specific diagnostic assays for these agents are needed is unknown of the bacteria that have been associated with respiratory disease in dogs and cats pcr assays are now routinely available for bordetella bronchiseptica mycoplasma spp streptococcus zooepidemicus and chlamydophila felis although b bronchiseptica is a well-defined primary pathogen in dogs the organism can be isolated from many clinically normal cats37 thus the ppv of culture and pcr assay are low in cats bordetella bronchiseptica is easily grown and culture is superior to pcr for this agent because antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be performed on isolates the organism is not usually eliminated by treatment and therefore posttherapeutic follow-up culture or pcr assay has minimal benefits chlamydophila felis is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of conjunctivitis and rhinitis although it is not a common cause of lower airway disease the organism is difficult to culture and so detection of microbial dna by pcr assays can be useful clinically however not all pcr-positive cats are clinically ill and so the ppv can be low pcr assays results can be used to prove a cattery has been cleared of the infection after treatment38
mycoplasma spp organisms are normal commensal organisms of the mucous membranes of multiple species including dogs and cats mycoplasma felis has been associated primarily with conjunctivitis in cats but is suspected as a primary cause of rhinitis in cats as well there are multiple mycoplasma spp of dogs and cats and the pathogenic potential for most is unknown if other primary diseases are present even nonpathogenic mycoplasma spp may be associated with the disease process39 40
mycoplasma spp culture can be difficult and antimicrobial susceptibility is not provided by most laboratories therefore mycoplasma spp pcr assays have at least moderate clinical utility genus-specific primers should probably be used because the pathogenic potential of all mycoplasma spp is not known however the ppv of the assays is likely to be low because mycoplasma spp are common flora the organism is not usually eliminated by treatment and so posttherapeutic follow-up culture or pcr assay has minimal benefit the most common viruses associated with feline respiratory disease are feline calicivirus fcv and feline herpesvirus 1 fhv-140 both viruses are extremely common in cats particularly those from crowded environments like pet stores catteries and shelters adenovirus 2 parainfluenza influenza respiratory coronavirus canine distemper virus and canine herpesvirus have the most potential to induce respiratory disease in dogs there are many fcv and mutations resulting in new strains are common41 this organism is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis stomatitis and conjunctivitis fcv is less commonly associated with polyarthritis lower airway disease in kittens and virulent systemic disease42 virus isolation can be used to document current infection but takes at least several days for results to return and is not performed by all laboratories because of widespread exposure and vaccination the ppv of serological tests is poor rt-pcr assays can be used to amplify calicivirus rna with quick and rapid return of results however these assays also amplify vaccine strains of fcv accordingly fcv rna can be amplified from samples collected from normal carrier cats as well as clinically ill cats and therefore fcv rt-pcr assays may have poor ppv for example the presence of fcv rna failed to correlate to the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats in a study from our laboratory43 in addition amplification of fcv rna cannot be used to prove virulent systemic calicivirus infection results of fcv rt-pcr can also be falsely negative and so assays may have poor npv treatment does not eliminate fcv infection and so there is no benefit to follow-up culture or rt-pcr testing fhv-1 is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis stomatitis conjunctivitis keratitis and facial dermatitis the ppv of serological tests is poor because of widespread exposure and vaccination fhv-1 infection can be documented by direct fluorescent staining of conjunctival scrapings virus isolation or pcr fhv-1 dna can be amplified from conjunctival cells of approximately 25 of healthy cats and therefore the ppv of pcr assay for this agent is low44 currently used pcr assays also detect vaccine strains of fhv-1 further lessening the ppv10 in one study in the authors laboratory presence of fhv-1 dna failed to correlate to the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats43 quantitative pcr may ultimately prove to correlate to the presence or absence of disease but failed to correlate to presence of conjunctivitis in one study in the authors laboratory45 the npv of the fhv-1 pcr assays is also in question because many cats that are likely to have fhv-1associated disease are negative this may relate to clearance of fhv-1 dna from tissues by the immune reaction tissue biopsies have greater sensitivity than conjunctival swabs fhv-1 dna can be amplified from aqueous humor of some cats but whether this indicates fhv-1 associated uveitis is unknown46 treatment does not eliminate fhv-1 infection and so there is no benefit to follow-up culture or pcr testing the viruses in dogs most commonly associated with respiratory disease adenovirus 2 parainfluenza influenza respiratory coronavirus canine distemper virus and canine herpesvirus generally have an acute course of disease47 48 therefore the syndrome is often resolving before the return of diagnostic test results from virus isolation or molecular diagnostic assays results of molecular diagnostic assays can also be negative by the time clinical signs develop in addition there are no specific treatments for the viral respiratory agents of dogs and so a definitive diagnosis is not required to optimize the treatment plan thus use of these assays has low clinical utility in individual dogs however when respiratory outbreaks occur in populations of dogs determining whether the primary agent is bacterial or viral may help in the planning of treatment bacteria or preventative programs 
toxoplasma gondii dogs and cats or neospora caninum dogs is associated with interstitial pneumonia that can progress to alveolar disease49 serological tests are available for both organisms but have low ppv because of high seroprevalence rates in normal animals dogs and cats with active disease may have tachyzoites present on cytological examination of airway washings however the agents can also be obscured by the inflammatory reaction in these situations pcr may be used to amplify the microbial dna50 pcr can also be used to differentiate t gondii from n caninum a variety of different serological assay and organism demonstration assays are available to aid in the diagnosis of the most common fungal causes of respiratory disease in dogs and cats including aspergillus spp blastomyces dermatitidis coccidioides immits cryptococcus neoformans and histoplasma capsulatum51 although molecular diagnostic assays have been evaluated in limited numbers of research studies there is minimal information concerning predictive values therefore the majority of clinical cases are diagnosed by other methods at this time  test performance evaluation of sars-cov-2 serological assays jeffrey

infections by sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for covid-19 have been reported though its full extent has yet to be determined due to limited testing2 government interventions to slow viral spread have disrupted daily life and economic activity for billions of people strategies to ease restraints on human mobility and interaction without provoking major resurgence of transmission and mortality will depend on accurate estimates of population levels of infection and immunity3 current testing for the virus largely depends on labor-intensive molecular techniques4 individuals with positive molecular tests represent only a small fraction of all infections given limited deployment and the brief time window when pcr testing has the highest sensitivity57 the proportion of undocumented cases in the original epidemic focus was estimated to be as high as 868 and asymptomatic infections are suspected to play a substantial role in transmission914 widely available reliable antibody detection assays would enable more accurate estimates of sars-cov-2 prevalence and incidence on february 4 2020 the secretary of the united states department of health and human services issued emergency use authorization eua for diagnosis of sars-cov-215 allowing nucleic acid detection and immunoassay tests to be offered based on manufacturer-reported data without formal fda clearance16 in response dozens of companies began to market laboratory-based immunoassays and point-of-care tests rigorous comparative performance data are crucial to inform clinical care and public health responses we conducted a head-to-head comparison of serology tests available to our group  comprised of immunochromatographic lateral flow assays lfas and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas our evaluation includes performance by time from symptom onset and disease severity our goal is to provide well-controlled performance data to help guide their potential development and deployment this study was approved by institutional review boards at the university of california san francisco ucsfzuckerberg san francisco general hospital zsfg and massachusetts general hospital mgh the study population included individuals with symptomatic infection and positive sars-cov-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs who had remnant serum and plasma specimens in clinical laboratories serving the ucsf and zsfg medical center networks we included multiple specimens per individual but no more than one sample per time interval 15 610 1115 1620 and 20 days after symptom onset if an individual had more than one specimen for a given time interval only the later specimen was included for specificity we included 108 pre-covid-19 plasma specimens from eligible blood donors collected prior to july 201817 we assessed cross-reactivity using 52 specimens from 2020 50 with test results for other respiratory viruses biofire filmarray biofire diagnostics salt lake city ut and 32 with negative results by sarscov-2 rt-pcr we based minimum sample size calculations on expected binomial exact 95 confidence limits a total of 288 samples were included in the final analysis including 128 from 79 sars-cov-2 rt-pcr-positive individuals some specimens were exhausted during the analysis and were not included in all tests data obtained from serial specimens that did not conform to our study design were excluded clinical data were extracted from electronic health records and entered in a hipaa-secure redcap database hosted by ucsf data included demographic information major comorbidities patient-reported symptom onset date symptoms and indicators of severity independent data from testing efforts at mgh with slight deviations in methods are included as supplementary data briefly 57 heat-inactivated serumplasma samples from 44 sars-cov-2 rt-pcr-positive individuals were included for specificity the mgh study included 60 heat-inactivated pre-covid-19 samples from 30 asymptomatic adults and 30 individuals admitted with febrile andor respiratory illness with a confirmed pathogen samples from ucsf and zsfg were assigned a random well position in one of four 96-well plates samples were thawed at 37c and up to 200ul was transferred to the assigned well without heat inactivation samples were then sub-aliquoted 125l to replica plates for testing replica plates were stored at 20c until needed then thawed for ten minutes at room temperature and briefly centrifuged before testing all sample handling followed ucsf biosafety committee-approved practices for the mgh study samples were heat-inactivated at 56c for 60 minutes aliquoted and stored at 4c and 20c samples stored at 4c were used within 7 days frozen aliquots were stored until needed with only a single freeze-thaw cycle for any sample all samples were brought to room temperature and briefly centrifuged prior to adding the recommended volume to the lfa cartridge ten lateral flow assays were evaluated etable 1 at the time of testing cartridges were labeled by randomized sample location plate well the appropriate sample volume was transferred from the plate to the indicated sample port followed by provided diluent following manufacturer instructions the lateral flow cartridges were incubated for the recommended time at room temperature before readings each cartridge was assigned a semi-quantitative score 0 for negative 1 to 6 for positive for test line intensity by two independent readers blinded to specimen status and to each others scores efigure 117 for some cartridges deepblue ucp bioperfectus the positive control indicator failed to appear after addition of diluent in a significant fraction of tests for these tests two further drops of diluent were added to successfully recover control indicators in all affected tests these results were included in analyses during testing two plates were transposed 180 and assays were run in the opposite order from the wells documented on cartridges these data were corrected and accuracy was confirmed by empty well position and verification of a subset of results epitope diagnostics elisas were performed according to manufacturer specifications cutoffs for igg and igm detection were calculated as the package insert described see supplementary methods values greater than the cutoff were considered positive an in-house elisa was performed with minor deviations from a published protocol18 sarscov-2 receptor binding domain rbd protein was produced from the published construct nr-52306 bei resources the positive cutoff was equal to the mean of the od values of the negative control wells on the respective plate plus three times the standard deviation of the od value distribution from the 108 pre-covid-19 plasma for both elisas background-corrected od values were divided by the cutoff to generate signal-to-cutoff sco ratios samples with sco values greater than 10 were considered positive for lfa testing the second readers scores were used for performance calculations and the first readers score was used to calculate inter-reader agreement statistics percent seropositivity among rt-pcr-confirmed cases was calculated by time interval from symptom onset specificity was based on results in pre-covid-2019 samples binomial exact 95 confidence intervals were calculated for all estimates analyses were conducted in r 363 and sas 94 sars-cov-2-positive individuals in the ucsfzsfg study ranged from 22 to 90 years of age table 1 the majority of sars-cov-2-positive individuals were hispaniclatinx 68 reflecting the zsfg patient population and demographics of the epidemic in san francisco1920 most presented with cough 91 and fever 86 chronic medical conditions such as hypertension type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity and chronic kidney disease were frequent of the 79 cases 18 were outpatients 46 inpatients without icu care and 37 required icu care there had been no reported deaths at the time of chart review the percentage of specimens testing positive rose with increasing time from symptom onset table 2 figure 1a reaching the highest levels in the 1620 and 20 day time intervals the highest detection rate was achieved by combining igm and igg results figure 1b however 95 confidence intervals for later time intervals showed substantial overlap with those for earlier intervals figure 1b four assays bioperfectus premier wondfo in-house elisa achieved 80 positivity in the later two time intervals 1620 and 20 days while maintaining 95 specificity some tests were not performed on a subset of specimens due exhausted sample material which may have affected reported percent positivity igm detection was less consistent than igg for nearly all assays kappa agreement statistic ranged from 095 to 099 for igg and 081100 for igm for standardized intensity score and training etable 2 and efigure 2 although variability in mean band intensities exists among different assays the rate of sample positivity was generally consistent figure 2 we observed a trend towards higher percent positivity by lfa for patients admitted to icu compared to those with milder disease but the specimen numbers per time interval were low limiting statistical power efigure 3 test specificity in pre-covid-19 samples ranged from 8431000 with 39 samples demonstrating false positive results by at least one lfa table 2 and figure 2b of the false positive results 615 2439 had a weak intensity score 1 intensity scores of 23 were seen in 308 1239 and scores of 46 were seen in 77 339 we evaluated the tradeoff between percent positivity and specificity as a function of lfa reader score changing the positive lfa threshold from 1 to 2 decreased the mean overall percent positivity across tests from 672 range 579754 to 578 range 447656 and increased the average specificity from 942 range 8431000 to 981 range 9441000 efigure 4 an independent study at mgh compared three lfas of which biomedomics was also assessed in the current study etable 3 overall both studies showed a trend for increased detection of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies with increased time from symptom onset however the mgh study displayed increased specificity with lower percent positivity at early timepoints after symptom onset mgh positivity thresholds were set higher to prioritize test specificity efigure 4bc a set of specimens obtained during the covid-19 outbreak that had negative sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing andor alternative respiratory pathogen diagnoses demonstrated higher numbers of positive results compared to the pre-covid-19 sample set figure 2c five specimens had positives results by 3 tests all with respiratory symptoms and concurrent negative sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing figure 2c arrows one patient was positive on 8 different tests including the in-house elisa in this limited panel no consistent pattern of cross-reactivity was identified in samples from individuals with non-sars-cov-2 respiratory viruses including 2 strains of seasonal coronavirus 1 coronavirus oc43 3 coronavirus hku1 agreement between results of lfas with those of igg and igm epitope elisas ranged from 757856 while agreement with the in-house elisa ranged from 835948 figure 3a lfa band intensity scores showed a direct correlation with elisa sco values figure 3b this study describes test performance for 12 covid-19 serology assays on a panel of 128 samples from 79 individuals with pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and 108 pre-covid-19 specimens for each test we quantified detection of igm andor igg antibodies by time period from onset of symptoms and assessed specificity and cross-reactivity we hope these data will inform the medical community public health efforts and governmental institutions considering sars-cov-2 serological testing this study also seeks to provide feedback to manufacturers about areas of success and necessary improvement there is no gold standard to identify true seropositive blood samples the extent and time-course of antibody development are not fully understood as yet and may vary between different populations even among rt-pcr-confirmed cases we focused on comparisons of percent positivity by time interval rather than reporting the sensitivity of each assay as expected percent positivity rose with time after symptom onset562124 high rates of positive results were not reached until at least 2 weeks into clinical illness diagnosis at time of symptom onset thus remains dependent on viral detection methods the assays showed a trend to higher positive rates within time intervals for more severe disease but this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the limited data from ambulatory cases the majority of samples 20 days post-symptom onset had detectable anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies suggesting good to excellent sensitivity for all evaluated tests in hospitalized patients three or more weeks into their disease course however well-powered studies testing ambulatory or asymptomatic individuals including performance with capillary blood will be essential to guide appropriate use of serology our data demonstrate specificity greater than 95 for the majority of tests evaluated and 99 for 2 lfas wondfo sure biotech and the in-house elisa adapted from amanat et al 202018 we observed moderate-to-strong positive bands in several pre-covid-19 blood donor specimens some of them positive by multiple assays suggesting the possibility of non-specific binding of plasma proteins non-specific antibodies or cross-reactivity with other viruses three of the pre-covid-19 specimens 28 were scored positive by more than three assays intriguingly the fraction of positive tests was higher in a set of recent specimens obtained during the covid-19 outbreak from individuals undergoing respiratory viral workup many with negative sars-cov-2 rt-pcr five of these 96 had positive results by more than three assays without relation to a specific viral pathogen suggesting non-specific reactivity andor missed covid-19 diagnoses one specimen was positive by 8 of 12 assays including the in-house elisa the patient was 90 years old and presented with altered mental status fever and ground glass opacities on chest radiological imaging sars-cov-2 rt-pcr was negative and ancillary laboratory testing suggested a urinary tract infection this case could represent covid-19 not detected by rt-pcr reinforcing the importance of caution in interpreting negative molecular results as ruling out the infection appropriate algorithms for serology testing including confirmatory or reflexive testing have yet to be determined these algorithms will be affected by test performance characteristics and prevalence of disease as well pretest probability of infection importantly we still do not know the extent to which positive results by serology reflect a protective immune response25 future functional studies are critical to determine whether specific antibody responses predict virus neutralization and protection against re-infection until this is established conventional antibody assays should not be used as predictors of future infection risk high specificity testing is crucial in low-prevalence settings one approach to increase specificity would employ confirmatory testing with an independent assay perhaps recognizing a distinct epitope or antigen our comparison of ucsf and mgh data suggests that reclassifying faint bands as negative or inconclusive changes test performance characteristics by increasing specificity albeit at the expense of sensitivity however the subjectivity of calling faint bands by individual readers may be difficult to standardize without specific control materials operator training andor objective methods of analyzing lfas in the clinical setting these parameters and protocols should be independently assessed and validated by clinical laboratories for operation under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia26 our study also reinforces the need for assay validation using standardized sample sets with 1 known positives from individuals with a range of clinical presentations at multiple time points after onset of symptoms 2 pre-covid-19 outbreak samples for specificity and 3 samples from individuals with other viral and inflammatory illnesses as cross-reactivity controls coordinated efforts to validate and ensure widespread availability of such standardized sample sets would facilitate effective utilization serology test performance data will be available on a dedicated website httpscovidtestingprojectorg current and future studies by our group and others will provide an essential evidence base to guide serological testing during the covid-19 pandemic  microbiology and infectious disease michael lappin r grant turnwald h   infectious diseases should be on the differential list for most problems especially those with fever or signs of inflammation history physical examination findings and routine clinical pathologic testing are seldom pathognomonic for an infectious cause but they help the clinician rank differential diagnoses and develop a logical diagnostic plan historical findings can increase the degree of suspicion for infectious diseases exposure to other infected animals or contaminated fomites is important for agents with direct transmission such as those inducing respiratory disease eg feline herpesvirus 1 canine bordetellosis or gastroenteritis eg canine and feline giardiasis canine and feline parvovirus infection potential exposure to vectors eg mosquitoes for dirofilariasis ticks for lyme borreliosis ixodes spp ehrlichiosis rhipicephalus sanguineus rocky mountain spotted fever rmsf dermacentor spp babesiosis r sanguineus or appropriate travel history eg coccidioidomycosis in the southwest rmsf in the southeast blastomycosis in the mississippi missouri and ohio river valleys can also suggest an infectious disease vaccination history deworming history and determination of whether other animals or people in the environment are also affected can aid in ranking infectious diseases on a differential diagnoses list physical examination findings may suggest an infectious cause infectious agents can induce fever lymphadenomegaly as a result of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can be infectious in origin hepatosplenomegaly can be caused by immunologic stimulation induced by chronic intracellular infections eg ehrlichiosis brucellosis endogenous uveitis commonly occurs after infections by feline immunodeficiency virus fiv feline infectious peritonitis fip virus toxoplasmosis and systemic mycoses mucopurulent discharges can suggest primary or secondary bacterial infections certain infectious diseases cause specific abnormalities such as dendritic ulcers feline herpesvirus 1 chorea mycolonus canine distemper virus or testicular swelling plus pain canine brucellosis finally clinicopathologic abnormalities can suggest disease caused by infectious agents neutrophilic leukocytosis particularly if found concurrently with a left shift or degenerative neutrophils see chapter 4 is consistent with an infectious cause of disease gram-negative sepsis is suggested by leukopenia with a degenerative left shift monocytosis can be induced by persistent infection with a number of intracellular agents that result in persistent infection polyclonal eg multiple infectious causes or monoclonal gammopathies eg usually induced by neoplasia rarely associated with canine ehrlichiosis may suggest chronic immune stimulation neutrophils in aqueous humor cerebrospinal fluid csf synovial fluid or urine may indicate inflammation induced by infectious agents cytologic examination of exudates blood film tissue imprint aspiration biopsy or wet mount of hair is indicated when bacterial and fungal diseases and occasionally rickettsial and viral diseases are suspected inexpensive readily available and may allow rapid confirmation and identification of an infectious agent assists in establishing normal flora and contaminants versus infection eg interpretation of relative numbers of bacteria and yeasts in the ear canal gives visualization of relative numbers of organisms at time of collection culture results may be misleading in terms of fast- or slow-growing bacteria infectious agents cannot always be found eg ehrlichiosis haemobartonellosis infections with numbers of organism that are below sensitivity level of cytology sometimes a presumptive cytologic diagnosis must be confirmed by other methods eg histopathology culture and cytology is of limited value in detecting viral inclusions except in brief viremic stages of canine distemper discharges from animals with suspected bacterial disease should be placed on a microscope slide air dried fixed and stained with both grams and romanowskys-type stains see chapter 16 the examination is started on low power 10x magnification with oil immersion 100x used for inspection of bacterial morphologic features ie rods cocci and grams stain characteristics ie gram-positive blue or gram-negative pink the primary disadvantage of grams staining is that gram-negative bacteria may be difficult to find because background material stains pink it is easier to find bacteria dark-blue stain and easier to study morphologic detail of other cells ie inflammatory cells using romanowskys-type stains grams staining may be variable organisms in body fluids may stain

mucosa of vomiting animals suggest helicobacteriosis to demonstrate inclusion bodies in acute feline chlamydial conjunctivitis conjunctival scrapings are obtained with a flat spatula smeared on a slide stained with romanowskys-type stains and examined for intracytoplasmic aggregations of chlamydophila felis previously chlamydia morulae of ehrlichia spp are rare in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells ehrlichia canis neutrophils ehrlichia ewingii anaplasma phagocytophila previously e equi or platelets ehrlichia platys mycoplasma haemofelis cats only m haemominutum cats only haemobartonella canis cytauxzoon felis cats only and babesia spp sometimes infect canine or feline erythrocytes for demonstration of cheyletiella spp a piece of transparent adhesive tape is gently pressed against areas with crusts or dandruff and then placed on a microscope slide next the hair is clipped mineral oil is placed on the skin and on a microscope slide and the skin is scraped using a blunt no 10 scalpel blade for skin scrapings to look for demodex spp the skin should be immobilized and mites expressed from follicles by pinching and scraping the extruded material for scrapings to look for sarcoptes spp or cheyletiella spp the scraping is continued more superficially inducing a mild capillary ooze over a larger surface area after transfer of the scraping the microscope slide field is scanned at 10x for mites for identification of dermatophytes hairs are plucked from the periphery of a lesion placed on a microscope slide and covered with 10 to 20 potassium hydroxide to clear debris the slide is then heated not boiled and examined under the 10x or 40x objective to search for hyphae spores conidia budding yeasts and fungus-induced damage eg swollen or broken hair shafts the 40x objective is used to identify arthrospores dense aggregates of spherical structures that may cover the hair shaft see color plate 3c failure to find arthrospores does not rule out dermatomycosis culture is more sensitive for diagnosis of dermatophytosis see fungal culture romanowskys-type stains eg wrights are used in preference to wet-mount preparations and ink when looking for fungi other than dermatophytes see chapter 16 romanowskys-type stains are also useful in identifying yeasts such as blastomyces dermatitidis histoplasma capsulatum sporothrix schenckii coccidioides immitis or cryptococcus neoformans see color plate 4e in exudates csf lymph node aspiration cytology or transtracheal aspiration cytology canine distemper virus inclusions in lymphocytes neutrophils or erythrocytes color plates 2d and 2e are diagnostic of infection but are only present transiently so false-negative results are common rarely fip-inducing strains of coronavirus result in transient intracytoplasmic inclusions in circulating neutrophils culture and antimicrobial susceptibility is indicated in most suspected bacterial diseases table 15-1
 especially when clinical syndromes have been resistant to medications remember skin and mucosal surfaces have a resident microflora table 15-2
 therefore care must be taken to avoid contamination usually allows the most effective treatment to be administered requires time for agents to grow some organisms are fastidious or have special culture requirements the expense and ease of contaminating or making inactivate cultures rendering results worthless the site of skin puncture should be prepared as for blood culture see discussion in following section if pyothorax or peritonitis seems likely but fluid cannot be aspirated lavage see chapter 10 is indicated because mixed infections are common and pure anaerobic infections may occur aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be performed blood cultures are indicated in suspected bacterial endocarditis or septicemia a large vein prepared surgically with sequential iodine and alcohol scrubs is used for three blood culture specimens obtained during a febrile episode over a 24-hour period in dogs with suspected endocarditis culture of fewer than three specimens significantly decreases the chance of positive results at least 5 ml of blood is placed directly into transport media
that will support the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and it is incubated at 20c for 24 hours clotted blood or blood containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or citrate are unacceptable because it decreases isolation of organisms bartonella spp are exceptions they can be cultured from edta tubes if a patient is critically ill and sepsis is suspected three cultures should be obtained over 1 to 3 hours before antimicrobial therapy is instituted because the urinary system is a common portal of entry for bacteria into the body urine is often cultured in patients when the source of septicemia or bacterial endocarditis is unknown bacterial infection of the central nervous system cns is uncommon even when infection occurs low numbers of organisms make cytology and culture low-yield procedures if increased numbers of neutrophils and increased protein are detected in csf see chapter 14 however aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are indicated csf should be placed in transport media
and delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture should be performed when bacterial infection of the cns is suspected conjunctival culture should be performed before topical anesthesia or application of fluorescein stain by rolling a moistened sterile swab over the conjunctiva ocular paracentesis is necessary for intraocular culture primary bacterial gastroenteritis occasionally occurs salmonella spp campylobacter spp c perfringens and e coli are important genera these organisms can also be isolated from normal animals however salmonella spp and campylobacter spp can cause small or mixed bowel diarrhea c perfringens is usually associated with large bowel diarrhea approximately 2 to 3 g of fresh feces should be submitted to the laboratory for optimal results if delayed transport of feces to the laboratory is expected the clinician should consult the laboratory for appropriate transport media because these organisms have special culture requirements the laboratory must be notified of the suspected pathogen a positive culture for c perfringens does not prove it was the cause of disease because not all c perfringens produce enterotoxin urine obtained by cystocentesis is preferred for urine culture if a patient is severely thrombocytopenic  50000l or if cystocentesis cannot be performed catheterization or a midstream-voided sample is acceptable quantitative culture is needed isolation of bacteria should always be assessed concurrently with the urine sediment rarely difficult to diagnose urinary tract infections require maceration and culture of a bladder wall biopsy specimen calculi should be crushed with a sterile mortar and pestle and cultured culture for mycoplasma spp or candida spp should be performed if pyuria is identified in absence of calculi masses and aerobic bacteria culture of the third fraction of an ejaculate preferred or prostatic massage is recommended for prostatic culture culture of the second fraction of an ejaculate is recommended for testicular culture culture of prostatic or testicular material retrieved by aspiration or biopsy can also be performed prostatic massage and closed prostatic aspiration or biopsy should be avoided in dogs with suspected prostatic abscesses obtaining distal urethral specimens for quantitative culture before and after ejaculation may help avoid confusion caused by urethral contamination anaerobic culture of urine or prostatic fluid is rarely useful in superficial pyoderma hair is clipped from the surrounding area but disinfection is not attempted a pustule is ruptured with a sterile fine-gauge needle and a swab of pus is cultured in deep pyoderma hair surrounding the lesion is clipped and the area is disinfected with an antiseptic the lesion is squeezed to express exudate which is collected on a swab gloves should be worn for culture of ears a sterile otoscope cone is inserted to the level of the horizontal canal and the ear is swabbed through the cone when middle-ear infection is suspected the animal is anesthetized and material for culture is retrieved by myringotomy by penetration of the tympanum with a sterile csf needle placed through a sterile otoscope cone no normal flora exists in musculoskeletal tissues dogs with radiographic evidence of diskospondylitis should be evaluated for brucella canis infection serologically see serologic tests for bacterial infections intervertebral joints can be cultured after fluoroscopically guided aspiration or when decompressive spinal surgery is required most cases of diskospondylitis develop after hematogenous spread of bacteria from an extravertebral source blood and urine are commonly cultured from patients with diskospondylitis staphylococcus spp are commonly involved dogs or cats with suppurative arthritis with or without cytologic visualization of bacteria should have the synovial fluid cultured for aerobes and mycoplasma spp see chapter 10 likelihood of positive culture results increases if the synovial fluid contains degenerative neutrophils l-form bacteria usually cannot be grown from joint fluid via routine culture techniques synovial biopsy for culture plus histopathologic evaluation for l-form bacteria is more sensitive than only culture of fluid borrelia burgdorferi is almost never isolated by routine culture from joints of dogs with lyme disease in osteomyelitis culture of fistulous tracts is less sensitive than culture of affected bone culture for infectious myositis is seldom performed unless suspicion for an anaerobic infection eg clostridium spp is based on foul odor subcutaneous sc emphysema or empyema the clinician can better evaluate for other infectious myopathies eg toxoplasmosis leptospirosis using serologic testing or pcr assays lower airway specimens are best obtained by transtracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage during bronchoscopy fine-needle pulmonary aspiration biopsy can be used but carries more risk see chapter 11 bacteria can be isolated from the trachea in some clinically healthy dogs these bacteria are probably transient common isolates are listed in table 15-2 because many organisms isolated from normal dogs have also been associated with lower respiratory tract inflammation all transtracheal aspiration samples should be evaluated by culture antimicrobial susceptibility and cytology with cytology the clinician should look for squamous cells coated with bacteria which indicates oropharyngeal contamination see figure 11-10 bacteria should not be considered significant unless accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation mycoplasma spp have been isolated in pure culture from lower airways of patients with clinical signs of respiratory disease randolph et al 1993 chandler and lappin 2002 culture for mycoplasma spp should be performed on all transtracheal aspiration samples these samples need to be transported to the laboratory in amies medium or modified stuarts bacterial transport medium mycoplasma spp culture should be specifically requested nasal specimens are best obtained from nasal lavage core biopsy or by passing a swab through a sterile otoscope cone see chapter 11 the clinician can best obtain pharyngeal specimens using a guarded swab taken during pharyngoscopy nasal and pharyngeal cultures can be difficult to interpret because of extensive normal flora in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx see table 15-2 for aerobic culture no special transport medium is required if the swab remains moist and can be inoculated onto the culture medium within 3 hours swabs containing liquid
or gel transport
media are frequently used however routine cultures can be safely stored in transport media at room temperature for up to 4 hours after this time overgrowth is a potential problem because of various growth rates of different organisms refrigerated routine specimens can be stored in transport media for at least 2 days tissue samples can be refrigerated for up to 2 days fluids eg urine can be safely stored at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours refrigerated for 24 hours and refrigerated in transport media for 72 hours jones 1998 quantitative culture is not accurate for fluids stored in transport media because of artifactual dilution for anaerobic culture fluid should be aspirated into a syringe the needle capped with a rubber stopper and the sample inoculated onto culture medium within 10 minutes of collection transport media that support the growth of anaerobic bacteria are available
but are not ideal for fastidious bacteroides spp and fusobacterium spp with these limitations samples can be refrigerated for 2 days in an appropriate transport medium blood agar plates grow most routine bacterial pathogens a biplate containing blood agar and macconkeys agar is frequently used the common anaerobic culture medium is thioglycolate the decision to perform in-office testing instead of using a commercial laboratory is based on caseload and available equipment with the exception of blood and feces the majority of culture procedures can be performed in office readers are referred elsewhere for details of equipment and operation of an in-office microbiology laboratory hirsh and ruehl 1986 sensitivity testing gives an in vitro estimation of suitability of a given concentration of an antimicrobial agent two techniques are used 1 the dilution test and 2 the disk diffusion test this test is quantitative and determines the least amount of antimicrobial needed to prevent growth of a microorganism minimum inhibitory concentration mic quantitative susceptibility testing is indicated when antimicrobial dosing schedules need to be monitored closely eg gentamicin or when disk test results are inapplicable equivocal or unreliable eg slow-growing organisms confirmation of susceptibility to polymyxins confirmation of susceptibility or resistance to given doses of aminoglycosides other indications include anaerobes and testing for synergism or antagonism between antimicrobials may be effective even though disk diffusion techniques suggest otherwise eg antibiotics concentrated in urine expense inability to perform in office and need to determine if required concentrations of a certain antibiotic are feasible ideally blood concentrations of drugs should be more than four times the mic and urine concentrations 10 to 20 times the mic mic sensitivity for topically administered antimicrobials is seldom determined because these methods are based on blood or urine concentrations this is the most widely used method in clinical practice ie kirby-bauer technique a zone of inhibition of bacterial growth is noted around a disk containing a fixed amount of antibiotic the procedure is qualitative and allocates organisms to the sensitive susceptible intermediate indeterminate or resistant category simplicity and suitability for most routine cultures can be performed in office and applicability for rapidly growing organisms eg enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus not suitable for slow-growing organisms and anaerobes inaccuracy in predicting susceptibility of poorly diffusing antibiotics eg polymyxins factors that influence the test eg ph and thickness of the medium concentration of organisms incubation time must be standardized it is imperative that proper procedures be followed to avoid errors in diagnosis artifacts result from improper sample collection ie wrong sample contamination improper sample transport failure to notify the laboratory of suspected pathogens eg salmonella spp anaerobic bacteria campylobacter spp mycoplasma spp recent antibiotic treatment and culture for a secondary rather than a slow-growing primary pathogen ie insufficient duration of culture failure to grow fastidious anaerobes may be caused by short seemingly insignificant exposure to oxygen or failure to use prereduced culture media recognizing normal flora see table 15-2 is necessary for correct interpretation preliminary identification is expected in 18 to 24 hours and antibiotic sensitivity is reported in 36 to 48 hours most aerobic and facultative organisms are identified within 5 days identification of anaerobic organisms or mycoplasma spp may require an additional 2 to 3 days bacterial pathogens commonly isolated from various body systems are listed in table 15-1 the overlap between resident and pathogenic organisms should be noted 
staphylococcus intermedius is the major pathogen isolated from the skin of dogs with pyoderma gram-negative organisms are likely to be contaminants in superficial pyoderma and secondary to s intermedius in deep pyoderma primary bacterial rhinitis is rare in dogs and cats but can result from infection with b bronchiseptica mycoplasma spp and chlamydophila felis cats primary bacterial pneumonia can result from bordetella bronchiseptica or mycoplasma spp whereas other organisms are usually secondary to viral infections or aspiration bacterial growth from urine obtained by cystocentesis is significant because the bladder is normally sterile urine cultures however are best interpreted in conjunction with a urinalysis if growth occurs despite absence of significant pyuria see chapter 7 sample contamination improper sample transport or diseases causing immune suppression eg hyperadrenocorticism diabetes mellitus fiv infection must be considered in quantitative culture of urine obtained by catheterization or midstream voiding greater than or equal to 100000 coloniesml is significant lower concentrations may be significant in chronic infections or in females in samples of prostatic fluid obtained by ejaculation infection is diagnosed if the specimen contains greater than or equal to 100 times more bacteria than the urethral sample ling et al 1983 culture of prostatic aspirates may be more accurate blood cultures can be difficult to interpret false-positive results are caused by contamination with normal cutaneous microflora including corynebacterium spp bacillus spp coagulase-negative staphylococci anaerobic diphtheroids streptococci and clostridium spp isolation of the same organism from two or more cultures strongly suggests that it is pathogenic whereas growth in only one culture is less certain unless it is a pathogenic bacterium unlikely to be a contaminant 
csf and synovial fluid are normally sterile any growth in an aseptically obtained sample is significant for dermatophyte culture hair is clipped from the lesion periphery hair shafts are plucked with forceps and cultured on dermatophyte test medium dtm

 sc and deep fungal infections are best diagnosed by cytologic or histopathologic evaluation with or without serology if organisms cannot be identified cutaneous lesions can be cultured but these are rarely useful owing to overgrowth by resident bacteria and fungi the lesion is prepared as for dermatophytes and a swab is cultured onto sabourauds and mycose medium systemic and sc fungi may require 2 weeks cultivation on sabourauds medium for growth to occur most cats with bartonellosis bartonella henselae are subclinically infected however fever uveitis lymphadenopathy gingivitis or stomatitis occur in some cats and are indications for antibody testing because the organism is transmitted between cats by ctenocephalidies felis cats with a history of flea infestation are more likely to be infected the clinical significance of other bartonella spp that infect cats is unknown at this time circulating antibodies are detected by immunofluorescent antibody assay ifa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and western blot immunoassay see appendix i for availability of testing cats infected by fleas are generally bacteremic by week 2 bacteremia can persist for months chomel et al 1996 antibodies are first detected at approximately week 2 and detectable concentrations persist for months after resolution of bacteremia bacteremia has also been detected in antibody-negative cats b henselae seroprevalence is often greater than 50 in regions with fleas in healthy cats in a birmingham alabama shelter the seroprevalence was 714 lappin et al 2000 because so many healthy cats are seropositive detection of positive antibody test results does not definitively diagnose clinical bartonellosis in a clinically ill cat the clinician must still exclude other causes of the clinical syndrome because antibody test results do not correlate to blood culture results and because treatment of healthy carriers is not recommended lappin et al 2003 screening healthy cats for bartonella antibodies is not indicated detection of local antibody production by the eye has been used to document uveitis as a result of bartonellosis lappin et al 2000 definitive diagnosis is based on detection of the organism in blood culture for b henselae is generally performed on a 15 ml whole blood sample collected aseptically and placed into an edta-containing tube organism dna can be amplified from blood or aqueous humor by pcr assay jensen et al 2000 lappin et al 2000 positive blood culture or pcr results are consistent with current infection but do not document clinical illness repeated bacteremia has been detected in experimentally inoculated and naturally infected cats kordick et al 1995 therefore a single negative blood culture or pcr result does not exclude infection see appendix i for availability of bartonella spp blood culture and pcr dogs from endemic areas or with an appropriate travel history with unexplained myocarditis granulomatous lymphadenitis cutaneous vascular disease hemolytic anemia polyarthritis granulomatous meningoencephalitis or thrombocytopenia should be considered for b vinsonii serologic screening based on seroprevalence studies rural dogs with fleas or ticks are most likely to be exposed circulating antibodies are detected by ifa see appendix i for availability of testing antibodies can be detected in dogs with and without clinical signs seronegative test results make clinical illness caused by b vinsonii less likely seropositive test results suggest that the organism could be involved but the clinician must still exclude other causes of the clinical syndrome definitive diagnosis is based on detection of the organism in blood but the organism is more difficult to culture than b henselae amplification of the organism dna is usually more successful than culture see appendix i for availability of testing positive blood culture or pcr results are consistent with current infection but do not document clinical illness a single negative blood culture or pcr does not exclude infection by b vinsonii dogs from areas endemic for ixodes ticks or with an appropriate travel history and fever lameness glomerulonephritis dambach et al 1997 or nonseptic suppurative polyarthritis should be suspected of having lyme disease borreliosis and screened for antibodies against borrelia burgdorferi serologic testing should be considered in dogs with cns disease renal disease and myocardial disease circulating antibodies are detected in serum by ifa elisa and western immunoblot see appendix i for availability of testing igm and igg antibodies against b burgdorferi can be detected in canine serum titers considered significant vary by laboratory and assay both antibody classes can persist in serum for months after exposure cross-reactivity with b burgdorferi antigens used in ifa and elisa occurs with other spirochetes thus a positive titer does not document exposure to b burgdorferi b burgdorferi vaccines induce antibodies that are detected by ifa and elisa and one of the available point-of-care assays
western immunoblot can differentiate vaccine-induced antibodies from those from natural infection jacobsen chang and shin 1996 a point-of-care kit
commercially available for detection of b burgdorferi antibodies against the c6 peptide e canis antibodies and dirofilaria immitis antigen was licensed recently antibodies against the c6 peptide are not induced by vaccination so positive results of this kit denote exposure to b burgdorferi some nonpathogenic strains of b burgdorferi induce antibody production but not clinical disease breitschwerdt 1995 some dogs with acute lyme disease are seronegative on initial testing documentation of an increasing antibody titer can suggest recent exposure antibody titers greater than or equal to 11000 have been detected in clinically normal dogs healthy dogs develop the same antibody responses as clinically ill dogs however because of these factors interpretation of serum antibody titers is difficult serum antibodies against b burgdorferi only documents exposure to b burgdorferi or a similar antigen not clinical disease finding a higher titer in csf than in serum occurs in some dogs with suspected neurologic disease secondary to lyme disease definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism by culture histopathologic evaluation of tissue or pcr presumptive diagnoses of clinical lyme disease in dogs can be based on appropriate clinical historical and laboratory evidence of disease combined with positive serologic testing and response to therapy dogs with reproductive tract abnormalities lymphadenomegaly hyperglobulinemia diskospondylitis or uveitis should be suspected of having brucellosis and screened for antibodies against b canis circulating antibodies are detected in serum by rapid slide agglutination test rsat tube agglutination test tat agar gel immunodiffusion agid and elisa carmichael and shin 1996 the rsat and tat are screening procedures a rsat for point-of-care use is commercially available
both assays should be performed with 2-mercaptoethanol 2-me to eliminate heterologous igm agglutinins responsible for most false-positive reactions false-positive reactions in the 2-me tat may be the result of autoagglutination in hemolyzed samples agid can be performed using cell wall antigens or cytoplasmic antigens agid performed with cytoplasmic antigens is the most specific antibody assay agid performed with cell wall antigens is the most sensitive because of nonspecific precipitin reactions positive results in agid with cell wall antigens are difficult to interpret minimal time between infection and a positive test result varies with the test but most infected dogs are seropositive in the 2-me tat and agid by week 4 after infection2-me tat titers from different laboratories cannot be meaningfully compared however a titer of 150 to 1100 is generally suspicious whereas a titer greater than or equal to 1200 usually correlates with isolation of b canis from blood culture carmichael and shin 1996 after cessation of bacteremia 2-me tat titers rapidly decrease to less than 1200 within a few weeks and remain low 125 to 150 for 6 months or longer in agid antibodies to external antigens persist for a few weeks whereas antibodies to internal ie cytoplasmic antigens persist up to 12 months after cessation of bacteremia although these animals are abacteremic b canis can be isolated from selected organs eg epididymis prostate when the 2-me rsat or tat are used as a screening test and results are positive a tentative diagnosis of brucellosis is made positive blood culture or agid should be used to confirm results if blood culture or agid is negative brucellosis is unlikely if 2-me rsat or tat results are negative in a dog strongly suspected of having brucellosis the test should be repeated in 4 weeks to preclude the possibility of early infection definitive diagnosis requires isolation of b canis although this is not always achieved although blood culture is ideal it is inconvenient and expensive culture of urine or an ejaculate may also be performed in males growth usually occurs within 7 days but cultures should be held for 3 to 4 weeks before being discarded at least three cultures from specimens obtained several days apart are recommended serologic testing for antibodies against leptospira spp should be considered in dogs with undiagnosed fever ecchymoses vomiting diarrhea muscle pain uveitis coughing dyspnea renal pain thrombocytopenia renal failure particularly acute or increased activities of hepatic enzymes the most common pathogenic serovars in dogs include leptospira canicola l icterohaemorrhagiae l grippotyphosa l bratislava and l pomona rentko and ross 1992 circulating antibodies are detected in serum by the microscopic agglutination test mat elisa igm igg and microscopic microcapsular agglutination test mcat most diagnostic laboratories use mat bolin 1996 the primary disadvantage of serologic testing is that it is difficult to determine whether positive titers are caused by active infection previous infection or vaccination antibodies are detected by mat days to weeks after inoculation most laboratories assess multiple serovars in the assay cross-reactivity exists between some serovars the serovar with the highest titer is probably the serovar causing infection acutely infected dogs are often mat negative dogs with suggestive clinical signs of disease but negative mat results should be retested in 2 to 4 weeks development of a positive titer confirms recent infection a fourfold increase in antibody titer over 2 to 4 weeks confirms recent infection vaccination can induce positive mat titers definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism by urine dark-field microscopy phase contrast microscopy or culture examination of urine for leptospires is a low-yield procedure demonstration of spirochetes by histopathologic evaluation of renal tissue leads to a presumptive diagnosis which may be confirmed by tissue culture in acute disease leptospiremia occurs for a few days to 2 weeks after infection during which time the organism may sometimes be cultured from blood urine can be cultured but repeated culture may be needed because of intermittent shedding the combination of increasing antibody titers with appropriate clinical pathologic abnormalities and clinical findings suggests clinical leptospirosis pcr can be used to demonstrate the organism in urine blood or tissues but is not widely available at this time is not standardized between laboratories and is expensive testing for tularemia ie rabbit fever should be considered in animals from endemic areas developing fever lymphadenomegaly weight loss or oral ulceration particularly if tick exposure rabbit ingestion or potential for human infection is confirmed tularemia is a direct zoonosis from clinically ill cats to people clinicians measure antibodies in serum using tat cross-reactivity with brucella abortus and certain strains of proteus vulgaris has been documented with human serum see appendix i for availability of testing time between acquisition of infection and a positive titer is not known a single titer of 180 or higher or a fourfold increase in titer between acute and convalescent sera 3 weeks later is presumptive evidence of infection definitive diagnosis is obtained by isolation of the bacterium in a culture of a blood specimen or by identification in tissue by immunofluorescence dogs and cats with nasal or pulmonary disease can be serologically screened for antibodies against aspergillus fumigatus cats are affected less frequently than dogs results must be interpreted in conjunction with cytology radiology histopathology and culture agid counterimmunoelectrophoresis ciep and elisa are used to detect circulating antibodies in serum sharp 1998 serum antibodies can represent exposure or infection results in many dogs with nasal aspergillosis are falsely negative owing to persistence of titers in some treated dogs 12 months monitoring titers to assess therapeutic response is not recommended radiographic demonstration of nasal turbinate destruction suggests aspergillosis or nasal neoplasia cytologic analysis see color plate 3d and culture of canine nasal exudate alone are not diagnostic because fungal elements may be nondetectable in affected dogs although being found in noninfected dogs including dogs with nasal tumors the organism is sometimes difficult to culture from an aspergilloma fungal ball nasal lavage is a low-yield procedure for demonstration of the organism nasal biopsy is suggested see chapter 11 definitive diagnosis should be based on three factors 1 histopathologic evidence of tissue invasion 2 an aspergilloma combined with serologic and culture evidence of infection or 3 serologic and radiographic evidence of infection ie bone lysis in rare cases with disseminated disease cytologic evaluation of aspirates of affected tissue may be useful if the organism cannot be demonstrated by biopsy samples obtained through the nares positive serologic test results may support exploratory surgery dogs from endemic areas with fever weight loss pulmonary interstitial disease lymphadenomegaly uveitis and blindness ulcerative or draining skin lesions undiagnosed prostatic or testicular disease intracranial disease osteomyelitis or rarely renal disease can be serologically screened for antibodies against blastomyces dermatitidis if the organism is not demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture in endemic areas screening for antibodies against b dermatitidis should be considered in cats with pulmonary interstitial disease intracranial disease lymphadenomegaly ulcerative or draining skin lesions or uveitis and blindness circulating antibodies are most commonly detected in serum by agid legendre 1998 because subclinical canine infections are unusual positive serologic results are considered significant false-negative results occur in animals with peracute infection or with advanced cases overwhelming the immune system many cats with blastomycosis are seronegative antibody titers do not always revert to negative after successful treatment definitive diagnosis requires identification of the yeast by cytology histopathology or fungal culture impression smears from skin lesions and aspirates from enlarged lymph nodes frequently reveal organisms recovery of organisms from transtracheal aspiration pulmonary aspiration biopsy samples or urine is less consistent culture requires 10 to 14 days and is of lower yield than cytology or biopsy diffuse nodular interstitial pulmonary disease and hilar lymphadenomegaly are common radiographic findings positive serologic results combined with appropriate clinical signs and radiographic abnormalities allow presumptive diagnosis dogs from endemic areas with pulmonary interstitial disease fever of undetermined origin hilar lymphadenopathy osteomyelitis uveitis pericarditis and nodular or ulcerative skin lesions can be screened for antibodies against coccidioides immitis if the organism is not demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture feline disease is rare but has been associated with nodular or ulcerative skin lesions pulmonary interstitial disease osteomyelitis uveitis and cns disease circulating antibodies are detected in serum by complement fixation cf agid elisa latex agglutination and tube precipitin tp tests tp detects igm antibodies cf and agid detect igg antibodies greene 1998 false-negative results in tp occur in early infections  2 weeks chronic infection rapidly progressive acute infection and primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis false-positive results in the cf test are caused by anticomplementary serum which may be caused by bacterial contaminants or immune complexes finally cross-reactions in patients with histoplasmosis and blastomycosis may occur with all tests after resolution of disease cf titers decrease over weeks but remain positive at a low titer eg 132 for months definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism on smears aspirates histopathologic evaluation or culture the organism is often difficult to demonstrate wet-mount examination of unstained or stained periodic acid-schiff smears or aspirates is more suitable than dry mounts which may distort the spherules common thoracic radiographic findings are mixed interstitial bronchial and alveolar pulmonary patterns and hilar lymphadenomegaly positive serologic test results and characteristic radiographic changes allow tentative diagnosis cats and rarely dogs with undiagnosed respiratory especially nasal cns eye especially uveal tract and skin especially nodular or ulcerative lesions infections can be screened for c neoformans antigen if the organism is not demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture measurement of antibodies against c neoformans is not clinically useful cryptococcal antigen is detected in serum aqueous humor or csf using latex agglutination la
 negative serum la titers may occur in early disease or uncommonly in chronic low-grade infections in chemotherapy-induced remission or in nondisseminated disease specificity of the serum la is high a titer of greater than 11 in serum or csf is positive very high titers are commonly detected in some animals decreases in serum titer parallel response to therapy malik et al 1996a positive titers occur in some animals after apparently successful clinical responses suggesting persistent low-grade infection or false-positive results flatland greene and lappin 1996 jacobs et al 1997 cryptococcal encephalitis may cause a positive csf la titer despite a negative serum la definitive diagnosis is based on cytologic histopathologic or culture demonstration of the organism or a positive la test result cytology is commonly positive color plate 4e because there are usually numerous yeasts found in affected tissues ie nasal and cutaneous lesions aqueous and vitreous humor note the organism can occasionally be recovered from nasal washings of normal animals malik et al 1996b csf may contain the yeast but concentration techniques ie cytocentrifugation should be used routine cytology stains eg wrights are adequate to demonstrate the organism large numbers of organisms are usually visible despite little or no inflammation culture is seldom necessary serologic testing is used if the yeast cannot be demonstrated cytologically or to monitor response to treatment a pcr assay has been used to amplify the organism dna from tissue but has not been assessed extensively to date kano et al 2001 animals with weight loss pulmonary interstitial disease uveal disease diarrhea or lymphadenomegaly can be serologically screened for antibodies against h capsulatum if the organism is not demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture wolf 1998 primarily agid is used to detect circulating antibodies in serum presence of serum antibodies confirm exposure but not clinical illness because of infection agid has questionable clinical usefulness because titers persist longer than 1 year after resolution of disease in some animals and both false-positive and false-negative results occur antibody testing is even less rewarding in cats definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism by cytology see color plate 3e biopsy or culture the organism is more difficult to demonstrate than b dermatitidis however cytologic examination of rectal scrapings in dogs with colonic histoplasmosis is often diagnostic fine-needle aspiration of other organs may demonstrate the organism in most cats with systemic histoplasmosis the organism is identified on bone marrow cytology thoracic radiographs are indicated if pulmonary histoplasmosis is suspected a nodular interstitial pattern is expected culture of h capsulatum is of lower yield than biopsy serologic diagnosis is unreliable generally not recommended and used only to establish a presumptive diagnosis when the organism cannot be demonstrated by cytology histopathology or culture but other abnormalities suggest the disease babesia serology is indicated in dogs from endemic areas or in those with an appropriate travel history that have fever anemia icterus splenomegaly ie acute babesiosis or intermittent fever and weight loss ie chronic babesiosis although babesiosis can cause anemia in cats the species infecting cats are not found in the united states circulating antibodies are detected in serum by ifa see appendix i for availability of testing in most laboratories titers greater than 140 are considered positive breitschwerdt 1995 experimentally infected dogs develop detectable igg titers approximately 3 weeks after infection false-negative results can occur in immature dogs in peracute cases or in dogs with concurrent immunosuppression antibodies against b gibsoni and b canis may or may not cross-react depending on the antigen source used by a particular laboratory some dogs with b gibsoni are seronegative on ifa using b canis antigen ifas are available using b gibsoni antigens dogs suspected of having babesiosis yet seronegative for b canis should be screened for antibodies against b gibsoni antibodies can be detected in dogs that are healthy and those that are clinically ill antibody titer magnitude does not correlate to the presence or absence of disease a titer of greater than 1320 was suggested for b gibsoni but not all infected dogs achieve this titer magnitude birkenheuer et al 1999 it is important to determine which species are involved in a case because response to treatment varies duration of positive titers after resolution of disease is unknown in untreated experimentally infected dogs titers remain high for at least 6 months untreated seropositive dogs should be considered carriers of the infection treatment is indicated only for seropositive clinically ill dogs definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism in blood

serologic cross-reactivity exists with t gondii at titers greater than or equal to 150 because the organism is a tissue protozoan seropositivity may correlate with permanent infection circulating

occur at approximately 1100 positive titers revert to negative 3 to 9 months after resolution of infection persistence of titers for greater than or equal to 9 months suggests a carrier state however positive antibody titers have been detected for months after apparently successful therapy in some naturally infected dogs bartsch and greene 1996 clinically ill seropositive dogs should be treated a minimum of 28 days and until clinical and laboratory abnormalities have resolved neer et al 2002 whether to treat healthy seropositive dogs is controversial the issues involved in this decision were recently reviewed neer et al 2002 the clinician can make a definitive diagnosis of e canis infection by demonstrating morulae ie clusters of the organism in mononuclear cells culture or pcr morulae are rarely found on routine blood smear or bone marrow aspiration cytology unless the dog has been immunosuppressed or the neutrophilic strain e ewingii is present ehrlichia spp can be isolated by tissue culture of heparinized infected canine blood or bone marrow aspiration samples but culture is of limited availability expensive and of low yield ehrlichia spp can be detected in whole blood by pcr mcbride et al 1996 and has potential benefit for use in monitoring treatment see appendix i for availability of testing the consensus statement on ehrlichial disease of small animals from the infectious disease study group of the acvim neer et al 2002 states the following if pcr is used to monitor treatment the pcr assay should be repeated after antimicrobial therapy has been discontinued for 2 weeks if pcr results are positive an additional 4 weeks of treatment should be given with the pcr assay repeated after antimicrobial therapy has been discontinued for 2 weeks if pcr results are positive after 2 treatment cycles use of an alternate antiehrlichial drug should be considered if pcr results are negative the test should be rechecked in 2 months if still negative therapeutic elimination is likely however the organism may be sequestered in other tissues like the spleen serologic testing for ehrlichiosis is indicated for cats with thrombocytopenia anemia leukopenia hyperglobulinemia proteinuria polyarthritis fever or lymphadenomegaly if no other obvious cause exists bouloy et al 1994 peavy et al 1997 stubbs et al 2000 ifa has detected circulating igg antibodies against e canis e risticii and anaplasma phagocytophila previously e equi in serum of cats pcr has detected dna of e canis breitschwerdt et al 2003 and a phagocytophila lappin et al 2003 in the blood of clinically ill cats some cats with presumed e canis infection have been seronegative antibodies against e canis e risticii and a phagocytophila can be detected in serum from healthy cats and therefore cannot be used alone to make a definitive diagnosis of ehrlichiosis a tentative diagnosis of feline ehrlichiosis is based on the combination of clinical signs positive serologic test results exclusion of other known causes and response to tetracyclines definitive diagnosis is based on demonstration of morulae in leukocytes or amplification of dna from the blood by pcr see appendix i for availability of pcr testing serologic testing for e platys infection is indicated for dogs from endemic areas or with appropriate travel history and thrombocytopenia or endogenous uveitis circulating igg antibodies against e platys are detected in serum by ifa antibodies against e platys do not react with e canis antigens see appendix i for availability of testing the cutoff for a positive igg antibody titer varies by laboratory experimentally infected dogs become antibody positive 13 to 19 days after infection french and harvey 1983 low antibody titers in suspected clinical cases should be rechecked after 21 days because many dogs are subclinically infected positive antibody titers do not prove clinical disease definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the organism within platelets difficult owing to cyclic parasitemia serologic testing for rmsf is indicated for dogs from endemic areas or with an appropriate travel history and acute onset of fever lymphadenomegaly petechiae neurologic signs stiff gait peripheral edema dyspnea or scleral congestion history of tick exposure is inconsistent exposed dogs either develop acute disease with approximately a 14-day clinical course or are subclinically infected the primary tick vectors are active from spring to fall in most of the united states therefore rmsf should only be considered a principal differential diagnosis for clinically ill dogs during this time span the majority of cases are diagnosed in southeastern states the clinician can measure antibodies against r rickettsii in canine serum by ifa elisa and la greene et al 1993 elisa or ifa can detect igm and igg antibodies against rmsf la is not antibody class-specific cutoffs for positive antibody titers as well as specificity and sensitivity vary by assay greene et al 1993 after experimental inoculation igm antibodies can be detected by ifa by day 9 peak by day 20 and are negative by day 80 breitschwerdt 1995 in dogs with clinical illness because of rmsf igm antibody titers are generally positive because igm has short duration in serum false-negative results may occur with igm testing false-positive results are most common in the igm elisa positive igg titers are detectable 20 to 25 days after infection serum samples with igg titers greater than or equal to 164 are generally considered positive if igg or igm antibodies are not detected in a patient with clinical and laboratory evidence of rmsf a convalescent igg titer 2 to 3 weeks later is recommended timing of the second titer is not critical because igg antibody titers do not decrease for at least 3 to 5 months after infection documentation of seroconversion or a fourfold increase in igg titer is consistent with recent infection a presumptive diagnosis of canine rmsf can be based on the combination of appropriate clinical historical and clinicopathologic evidence of disease serologic test results exclusion of other causes of the clinical abnormalities and response to anti-rickettsial drugs documentation of seroconversion or an increasing titer 2 to 3 weeks after initial serologic testing suggests recent infection diagnostic criteria used in one recent study included a four-fold rise in antibody titer or a single titer of greater than or equal to 11024 if the initial titer was submitted 1 week or more after initial onset of clinical abnormalities gasser birkenheuer and breitschwerdt 2001 positive serum antibody test results alone do not prove rmsf because subclinical infection is common in addition positive serum antibody tests do not document infection by r rickettsii because infection with nonpathogenic spotted fever group agents induce cross-reacting antibodies demonstration of r rickettsii by inoculating affected tissues or blood into susceptible laboratory animals or by documenting the organism in endothelial cells using direct fluorescent antibody staining leads to a definitive diagnosis of rmsf but are not clinically practical pcr can be used to document the presence of rickettsial agents in blood other fluids or tissues and will likely be clinically useful in the future dogs with appropriate signs of cns disease can have antibodies in csf and serum against canine distemper virus the clinician can measure csf and serum igg antibodies against canine distemper virus by serum virus neutralization ifa or elisa elisa can be used to measure serum igm antibodies csf antibodies to distemper virus are increased in some dogs subsequently diagnosed histopathologically as having distemper encephalitis false-positive results can occur in csf samples contaminated with blood concurrent measurement of serum antibody concentrations can be helpful if csf concentrations are greater than serum concentrations the antibody in csf had to be produced locally and suggests cns distemper detection of serum igg antibodies is of minimal diagnostic value because a positive titer could develop secondary to vaccination or previous exposure a fourfold increase in serum igg titer over a 3- to 4-week period suggests recent infection detection of circulating igm antibodies is consistent with recent infection but not clinical disease a point-of-care assay for detection of canine distemper antibodies is available
vaccinated dogs seropositive in this assay probably do not need to be boosted a presumptive diagnosis of distemper encephalitis can be made with increased csf protein and leukocytes lymphocytes predominating plus a positive csf antibody titer in a sample not contaminated with peripheral blood definitive diagnosis of canine distemper infection requires demonstration of viral inclusions by cytologic examination see color plates 2d and 2e direct fluorescent antibody staining of cytologic or histopathologic specimens histopathologic evaluation or pcr documentation of distemper viral dna in peripheral blood csf or conjunctival scrapings see appendix i for availability of pcr testing viral inclusions can rarely be found in erythrocytes leukocytes and leukocyte precursors of infected dogs inclusions are generally present for only 2 to 9 days after infection and therefore often are not present when clinical signs occur inclusions may be easier to find in smears made from buffy coats or bone marrow aspirates than those made from peripheral blood viral particles can be detected by immunofluorescence in cells from the tonsils respiratory tree urinary tract conjunctival scrapings and csf for 5 to 21 days after infection viral enteritis induced by parvoviruses coronaviruses and other viruses should be suspected in young animals with fever and diarrhea particularly if neutropenia is present ie parvoviruses determining serum antibodies to feline parvovirus and canine parvovirus or coronavirus is rarely performed clinically because positive results do not correlate with clinical disease a point-of-care assay for detection of canine parvovirus antibodies is available
vaccinated dogs seropositive in this assay probably do not need to be boosted detecting fecal shedding of canine parvovirus viral antigen by electron microscopy virus isolation fecal hemagglutination fecal la or elisa is more useful in-office elisa for canine parvovirus in feces seem to accurately detect fecal shedding of parvovirus in acute cases see chapter 9


the specificity of the assays is good but they cannot differentiate vaccine strains of parvovirus and virulent strains false-negative reactions can occur these assays may also detect feline parvovirus virus isolation or electron microscopy is required to identify other canine or feline viruses in feces fip is an appropriate differential diagnosis in cats with fever uveitis retinal hemorrhage nonseptic abdominal or pleural exudates or modified transudates anemia hyperglobulinemia and renal hepatic or neurologic abnormalities results of currently available tests cannot be used to definitely diagnose fip circulating antibodies against coronaviruses can be detected by ifa and elisa in feline serum antibody to coronavirus indicates prior exposure to either enteric coronaviruses or fip-inducing coronaviruses a positive titer does not diagnose fip or protect against disease feline vaccines containing bovine serum occasionally cause false-positive results cats with fip can rarely have negative results because of rapidly progressive disease with a delayed rise in titer disappearance of antibody in terminal stages of the disease or immune complex formation a positive coronavirus antibody titer does not predict whether a cat will ever develop fip titer magnitude cannot distinguish between exposure to enteric coronaviruses or fip-inducing strains positive titers can be induced by vaccination for coronavirus kittens can be seropositive because of colostrum-derived antibodies until 9 weeks of age if adult cats in the environment infect kittens antibodies can be detected again 8 to 14 weeks later current coronavirus infections can be detected by fecal virus isolation electron microscopy of feces or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr of feces however positive test results do not indicate fip because antibody-positive healthy cats can pass coronaviruses addie and jarrett 1992 definitive diagnosis of fip requires histopathologic evaluation of tissues lesions visible by light microscopy are generally pathognomonic but immunohistochemistry can be used to confirm coronavirus particles pcr can also detect coronavirus particles in effusions tissues and blood barr 1996 detecting coronavirus by pcr in effusions and tissues predicts fip but detection in blood does not hyperproteinemia and polyclonal gammopathy detected by electrophoresis see chapter 12 can occur particularly in the noneffusive form monoclonal gammopathy rarely occurs classic nonseptic pyogranulomatous exudate or modified transudate with high protein and relatively low cell count see chapter 10 is commonly used for presumptive diagnosis electrophoresis can also be performed on body fluids a gamma globulin fraction greater than or equal to 32 is highly suggestive of fip whereas an albuminglobulin ratio in body fluid greater than 081 probably rules out fip shelly scarlett-kranz and blue 1998 cats with chronic weight loss fever rhinitis conjunctivitis gingivitis dermatitis diarrhea uveitis recurrent abscessation clinical toxoplasmosis any chronic infectious disease chronic renal failure or lymphadenomegaly should be evaluated for fiv infection igg antibodies are detected in serum by elisa ifa and western blot immunoassay western blot immunoassay is performed in some commercial laboratories an in-office elisa is available for fiv antibodies and felv antigen combined
seroconversion occurs 5 to 9 weeks after inoculation in experimentally infected cats seropositive cats are probably infected with fiv for life false-positive reactions can occur in the elisa barr 1996 positive elisa results should be confirmed via western blot immunoassay or ifa finding circulating antibodies only confirms infection not clinical illness kittens can have detectable colostrum-derived antibodies until 12 to 14 weeks because many clinical syndromes associated with fiv infection are caused by opportunistic infections further diagnostic procedures may determine treatable causes for example many fiv-seropositive cats with endogenous uveitis are co-infected by t gondii virus isolation and pcr are available in some laboratories and can be used to confirm infection a recently marketed fiv vaccine induces serum antibodies that are indistinguishable from antibodies induced by natural exposure at least by use of currently available antibody tests the ability of virus isolation or pcr to accurately differentiate naturally exposed and vaccinated cats is currently unknown because of diverse manifestations of felv infection testing is indicated in all clinically ill cats especially those with evidence of infectious neoplastic reproductive immunologic or hematologic disease as well as in clinically normal cats exposed to felv-positive cats viral antigen p27 is detected by ifa in neutrophils and platelets from blood or bone marrow or in blood plasma serum saliva or tears by elisa testing of serum gives the best results tears and saliva should not be tested several point-of-care elisa tests are available




antibody titers to felv envelope antigens neutralizing antibody and against virus-transformed tumor cells feline oncogenic cell membrane antigen or focma antibody are available in some laboratories but the prognostic significance of the results is currently unknown therefore the tests are not recommended felv infection has six stages zenger and wolf 1992 stages 1 through 3 are dissemination stages bone marrow infection occurs in stage 4 infected neutrophils and platelets are released from the bone marrow in stage 5 and virus appears in systemic epithelial tissues including salivary glands and tear glands during stage 6 elisa can detect p27 antigen in serum during stages 2 through 6 p27 in cells is not detected by the ifa until stages 5 and 6 thus serum elisa is the first assay to become positive after infection positive results occurring 2 to 30 weeks generally 2 to 8 weeks after infection seropositivity can be detected by serum elisa before a cat develops persistent ie stages 4 to 6 infection thus some cats yield negative results after development of neutralizing antibodies in healthy cats seropositive results by serum elisa should be confirmed by ifa or retesting by elisa in 4 to 6 weeks some elisa-positive cats reverting to negative status have become latently infected the majority of latently infected cats are elisa-negative on all testing but virus can be isolated from bone marrow virus can also be localized to other tissues false-positive elisa results can be the result of poor laboratory technique a positive ifa test result has 99 correlation with virus isolation false-negative reactions may occur when leukopenia or thrombocytopenia prevents evaluation of an adequate number of cells false-positive reactions rarely occur from nonspecific staining of eosinophils a positive ifa indicates that the cat is viremic and contagious the viremia may be transient or sustained unless the ifa test is performed during a transient infection the animal will likely  95 remain positive for life virtually all ifa-positive cats are elisa-positive finding an ifa-positive but elisa-negative cat suggests technique-related artifact a negative elisa result is approximately 100 correlated with negative ifa and an inability to isolate felv cats that are elisa-positive but ifa-negative are called discordant discordant results are usually caused by false-positive elisa results false-negative ifa results or transient stage 2 to 3 infection the american association of feline practitioners has summarized testing recommendations for felv or fiv infections httpwwwaafponlineorgaboutguidelinesretrovirustesting2001pdf some cats with latent infection localized to bone marrow have positive bone marrow ifa results the most reliable means of identifying latent felv infections is virus isolation or pcr performed on bone marrow cells but neither technique is widely available a latently infected cat may become viremic ie ifa- and elisa-positive after extreme stress or administration of glucocorticoids cytologic evaluation for microfilaria is indicated in dogs with signs consistent with heartworm disease right-sided heart disease coughing dyspnea eosinophilia polyclonal hyperglobulinemia protein-losing nephropathy pln in dogs about to begin prophylactic therapy with diethylcarbamazine ivermectin or milbemycin and rarely in cats with signs consistent with heartworm disease ie dyspnea cardiomegaly unexplained vomiting very specific microfilaria morphology differentiates d immitis microfilaria from those of dipetalonema reconditum quick and inexpensive all concentration techniques knotts and filter tests are much more sensitive than examination of fresh blood smears and are reasonably sensitive in dogs that have not been treated with filaricidal drugs up to 40 of dogs have spontaneous occult dirofilariasis zimmerman 1992 and must be diagnosed by serologic testing and radiographic examination all cytology tests have poor sensitivity in cats a positive test result diagnoses heartworm disease except in juveniles less than 4 to 5 months of age that could have received the microfilaria by transplacental transfer up to 40 of infected dogs are amicrofilaremic infected dogs receiving ivermectin or milbemycin as heartworm preventive are commonly amicrofilaremic clinical or laboratory signs of heartworm disease despite one or more negative microfilaria tests indicate serologic testing for circulating heartworm antigen chest radiographs echocardiography or a combination of these amicrofilaremic dogs or cats with clinical signs laboratory abnormalities or thoracic radiographic changes consistent with dirofilariasis dogs on ivermectin selamectin or milbemycin preventive can have sterile female adult worms and be amicrofilaremic the test can also be used to assess efficacy of adulticide treatment greater sensitivity when compared with microfilaria detection techniques more expensive than microfilaria detection techniques elisa can detect circulating heartworm antigen in serum several kits are commercially available



intestinal parasites d reconditum hemolysis and concurrent use of diethylcarbamazine ivermectin or milbemycin do not alter results of antigen assays in dogs d immitis antigen tests may be positive as early as 5 to 6 months and are usually positive 6 to 7 months after infection false-negative results usually occur in early stages of infection and may occur in single-sex infections male only or in animals with low worm burdens  3 to 5 worms retesting in 2 to 3 months should be performed to detect dogs in which results were negative in early stages of infection after successful adulticide treatment test results become negative in approximately 12 weeks in experimental infections cats testing positive did so about 8 months after infection however single sex or low worm burden infections can lead to false-negative results therefore a positive antigen test result is specific for infection but a negative result does not rule out dirofilariasis in cats the combination of serum antigen test results with serum antibody test results is more sensitive than performing either test alone synder et al 2000 definitive diagnosis requires detecting circulating microfilariae characteristic radiographic signs ie right-sided cardiac enlargement increased diameter with or without tortuosity of pulmonary arteries pulmonary interstitial infiltrate or circulating heartworm antigen amicrofilaremic dogs with clinical signs of disease should be evaluated for serum antigen and with thoracic radiographs in a previously infected and treated dog it may be impossible to differentiate new from old radiographic lesions in such cases serum antigen testing is indicated coughing unexplained vomiting syncope or radiographic evidence of heartworm disease several elisas detect antibodies to d immitis in feline sera




the assays are more sensitive than microfilaria demonstration techniques the assays are very specific no cross-reactivity exists with d reconditum the positive predictive value for heartworm disease is less than 100 however because circulating antibodies can be present in cats that have cleared the infection naturally false-negative antibody test results also occur therefore serum antibody and antigen tests should be performed in concert in cats with suspected dirofilariasis synder et al 2000  antibody testing for covid-19 david grenache g cordelia sever gagan mathur sweta mathur   we read with interest the editorial regarding the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 serologic tests as a screening tool in populations with low prevalence1 we agree that use of antibody tests for the novel coronavirus have the potential to be useful for clinical and population health applications this is particularly true when the prevalence of antibodies in the tested population is at least 10 or greater as the authors show lower prevalence results in suboptimal positive predictive values even for serologic tests that have 99 specificity of concern to us is how the authors chose to represent the clinical sensitivity of the 10 serologic tests that had been granted emergency use authorization not approval by the food and drug administration fda as of april 30 2020 the sensitivities shown in table 1 of their article are acknowledged as being derived from information on the fda website however rather than reporting sensitivity positive percent agreement relative to the day of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 symptom onset or diagnosis the authors chose to calculate sensitivity using the total of all specimens tested without regard to the timing of sample collection personal communication from authors in our opinion reporting sensitivity in this way is misleading as it understates the optimal sensitivity defined as the ability of a test to detect sars-cov-2 antibodies when they are present no test is able to detect antibodies that are not present because they have not yet been produced or are at a concentration that is well below analytical sensitivity as will happen in very early infection the authors justified their calculation of sensitivity by stating that the tested population may not always be several days to weeks away from diagnosis while this is true the same could be said for any serologic test that is used as a screening test as an example the sensitivities of hiv antibody tests are calculated from individuals known to contain antibodies or from seroconversion panels it is well known that tests for infectious disease antibodies will have lower sensitivities if used in very recently infected patients the same is true for the novel coronavirus calculating and reporting antibody test sensitivity without regard to onset of infection is a practice to be avoided we would like to stress that our editorial intends to point out limitations of using antibody serologic tests as a screening tool mainly due to the low prevalence of covid-19 in most parts of the united states and not specifically due to the limitations of test performance sensitivity and specificity of any individual test in the market test performance mainly specificity does contribute to low positive predictive value ppv of antibody tests however low prevalence is the main contributing factor as shown in table 2 of the editorial we understand the concerns regarding presenting clinical sensitivity of the serologic tests as an average in table 1 of the editorial instead of separating it by the timing of collection we decided to present test performance data as an average of all specimens tested for the following reasons 1 there is no uniformity in the data submitted to the fda by test manufactures 2 the table would have been too lengthy if we had split out sensitivity and specificity for each cohort tested for each manufacturer and 3 clinically the patients most likely will be tested irrespective of days post infection or start of the symptoms to our knowledge the manufacturers that have been granted emergency use authorization by the fda do not specify in their instructions for use that the tests are intended to be used for patients only after certain days post infection or start of symptoms  mycoplasma pneumoniae current knowledge on nucleic acid amplification techniques and serological diagnostics katherine loens margareta ieven   pcr is accepted as a rapid diagnostic test few of the currently available naats have been extensively validated against culture the sensitivity of naats is almost always superior to that of traditional procedures and they are more and more considered as the new gold standard an increasing body of literature describing the use of in-house naats for detection of m pneumoniae dna or rna in various diseases is available with a great variation of methods used from study to study including variability of target p1 adhesin gene 16s rrna atpase gene protease gene cards toxin gene naat conventional nested real-time monoplex vs multiplex pcr vs isothermal amplification technologies detection formats and different platforms an overview of the literature on the use of naats to detect m pneumoniae since 1989 is given in two reviews loens et al 2003 2010a lately efforts have been mainly emphasized on the development of multiplex assays nummi et al 2015 shen et al 2015 and on the evaluation of commercially available assays respiratory viruses and other so called atypical bacteria are all responsible for rtis that may produce clinically similar manifestations in order to reduce costs and hands-on-time multiplex naats for the simultaneous detection of 2 3 or up to more than 20 different respiratory pathogens in one tube with a mixture of primers have been developed by some groups however comparison between mono-and multiplex assays has been rarely performed findings and conclusions result frequently in contradictory and conflicting data concerning the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex naats compared to the mono naats this is not unexpected since the presence of several pairs of primers may increase the probability of mispairing resulting in non-specific amplification products and the formation of primer-dimers furthermore enzymes primers and salt concentrations as well as temperature cyclings required for each target may be slightly different the results of the proficiency panels loens et al 2010b 2012 described previously seem to confirm that multiplex assays are somewhat less sensitive than monoplex assays but until the number of organisms present in clinical specimens of diseased individuals is known it is impossible to state whether the degree of sensitivity attained is clinically acceptable since the previous review ieven and loens 2013 new naats became commercially available such as the illumigene meridian bioscience usa kit it has been proposed that industry-produced assays in kit form result in better standardization the analytical sensitivity of the illumigene assay was evaluated by using 36 frozen stock cultures of m pneumoniae reference strains and a collection of other microorganisms and human dna ratliff et al 2014 serial dilutions of cultures with a known cfuml defined the analytical sensitivity at 88 cfuml based on the results obtained with 214 archived respiratory specimens previously cultured for m pneumoniae the clinical sensitivity and specificity were found to be 100 and 99

3437 m pneumoniae positive clinical specimens were confirmed by the diagenode test the ingenetix and lightmix assay and the geneproof assay respectively an overview of commercially available naats for the detection of m pneumoniae is presented in table 1 since the calculation of the sensitivities of the commercial multiplex assays was mainly dependent on dna copy number further evaluation and standardization using an extended number of clinical specimens that may have a low bacterial load are needed the use of an international standard developed by the who for harmonization of mycoplasma naat nbling et al 2015 or the yearly participation in the external quality assessment eqa panel for m pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae available from quality control for molecular diagnostics qcmd united kingdom should be considered so far it is unclear whether asymptomatic carriage of m pneumoniae in adults and children exists and if colonization could be differentiated from infection by the current diagnostic methods there are only few data on the relation between the bacterial load and the severity of infection 405 asymptomatic children and 321 children with a rti were enrolled in a cross-sectional study spuesens et al 2013 nasopharyngeal washings and pharyngeal swabs were investigated by culture and quantitative real-time pcr qpcr serum was collected for igm and igg elisa neither qpcr serology nor culture was capable of differentiating colonization from infection in 212 and 162 of the asymptomatic and symptomatic children m pneumoniae dna was detected in addition persistence of m pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract was shown for up to 4 months by longitudinal sampling a retrospective study investigated the clinical significance of the m pneumoniae bacterial load in children with a m pneumoniae pneumonia jiang et al 2014 the authors concluded that a high bacterial load was indicative for a m pneumoniae infection whereas for a low bacterial load the etiologic role of m pneumoniae remains to be determined edin et al developed a qpcr with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria including m pneumoniae and six viruses edin et al 2015 clinical specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract were used to compare the qpcr assay with standard microbiological methods the use of the qpcr assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics the authors conclude that in parallel qpcr detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible since a good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens was obtained in contrast to the above mentioned studies jain et al 2015 examined specimens from 2222 hospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia and 521 asymptomatic controls for the detection of a variety of respiratory pathogens m pneumoniae was detected in 8 and in 3 or less of controls another trend is the simultaneous detection of m pneumoniae and mutations associated with macrolide resistance directly in clinical specimens ji et al 2014 liu et al 2014 nummi et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 serological methods in particular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa are most widely used to diagnose a m pneumoniae infection the complement fixation test cft has been replaced by assays which allow for quantification of igm iga or igg however the most convincing evidence of an ongoing infection is a significant increase in igg or an igg seroconversion in paired sera collected 34 weeks apart nir-paz et al 2006 although igm antibodies appear earlier than igg antibodies and are thus an attractive alternative for diagnosis of a m pneumoniae infection one should realize that igm is not often produced in very young children in a proportion of primary infections and during re-infections waites et al 2008 loens et al 2010a ten serological assays for the diagnosis of a m pneumoniae infection were recently evaluated by using 145 sera from 120 patients busson et al 2013 seromp igm and igg savyon diagnostics seromp recombinant igm iga and igg savyon diagnostics liaison m pneumoniae igm and igg biotrin international ltd m pneumoniae igm iga and igg medac medac gmbh a low igm specificity and cross-reactivity was noticed for the seromp recombinant and liaison assay for iga the medac assay tended to be less specific than the seromp recombinant assay all four tests showed discrepancies in the igg measurements confirming results of previous studies talkington et al 2004 beersma et al 2005 in conclusion serology remains a diagnostic tool of choice but improvement and standardization of the assays are still needed especially for the determination of igg the clinical significance of a serologic test both for igm and igg should be defined by studies of patients with a documented infection and for whom detailed information concerning the time lapses between onset of disease and the collection of the serum specimens are known a promising blotting technique improving the performance of the m pneumoniae serological assays has been described dumke et al 2012 data from recent studies using pcr based methods and serology published during the last decade in different patient populations from around the world are summarized in the recent reviews published by ieven and loens loens et al 2010a ieven and loens 2013 and updated in table 2 the availability of the very sensitive naats has in recent years also put the often used serological tests in their right perspective and allow a better interpretation of the serological test results and their limitations such as the low sensitivity of igm antibodies in acute phase specimens and importance of the delay between two serum samples studies in which also naats are used on respiratory specimens should allow a better interpretation of the serological test results a rapid response report from the canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health 2015 presents the results of a literature search in order to identify the diagnostic test accuracy clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of serum igm and molecular tests for the detection of m pneumoniae in patients with a respiratory infection1 six relevant studies were identified but no evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of a serum igm test compared with molecular tests was identified zhang et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnosis of m pneumoniae by pcr and serology zhang et al 2011 and reported a significant heterogeneity between the studies and inconsistent results as well two studies compared the application of real-time pcr and serology in children with pneumonia in 2011 54290 children were found to be positive by pcr chang et al 2014 44182 were m pneumoniae igm positive 126 of patients were found to be m pneumoniae positive by both tests at the same time using pcr as gold standard a sensitivity and specificity of resp 622 and 855 were obtained the specificity could be increased to 903 by increasing the cut-off without changing the sensitivity of the igm assay a study conducted by medjo et al 2014 applied pcr culture igm and igg in paired sera for the detection of a m pneumoniae infection in 166 children using igg serology as gold standard the sensitivity of igm pcr and culture was found to be equal 818 specificity was found to be 100 986 and 100 respectively it was concluded that during the acute phase of disease detection of igm antibodies in combination with pcr allowed for a precise and reliable m pneumoniae diagnosis a prospective study in children with community-acquired cap kakuya et al 2014 compared loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp culture and serology at first visit patients were defined positive if positive by culture andor sero-conversion or a four-fold increase in igg in paired sera 31191 patients met the criteria thirteen were positive by culture and serology 17 on culture only and one by serology only a positive lamp result was obtained for all patients that were culture positive the sensitivity and specificity for lamp eia and the particle agglutination test were 968 387 194 and 100 769 and 931 respectively when establishing the etiology in 267 adult cap-patients in norway 10 were found to be m pneumoniae positive two by serology seven and one by pcr applied to a nasopharyngeal flocked swab and an oropharyngeal flocked swab respectively holter et al 2015 newer technologies such as microfluidics and the application of nanotechnology offer the potential to an even more rapid detection of important pathogens allowing even near-patient testing since these technologies as naats do not require viable organisms and thus avoid any adverse effect of longer specimen transport they can be successfully applied to both the in- and outpatient settings several companies currently possess the technical expertise and research infrastructure to bring a useful diagnostic testing approach to the clinical trial stage shortly li et al 2015 developed a colloidal gold-based immune-chromatographic assay by using a pair of monoclonal antibodies targeting a region of the p1 gene when applied to 303 clinical specimens from children suspected with a m pneumoniae infection the sensitivity and specificity against real-time pcr were 100 and 974 this is in contrast to the results obtained with a commercially available rapid antigen test targeting the ribosomal protein l7l12 ribotest mycoplasma compared to real-time pcr a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 625 and 909 were obtained when applied to clinical specimens miyashita et al 2015 based on these results the authors concluded that treatment decisions should not be taken based on the ribotest results alone other amplification-free detection methodologies are currently being developed as biosensing detection strategies a proto-type of an enzyme-free electrochemical genosensor on nanostructured screen-printed gold electrodes garcia-gonzalez et al 2015 a silver nanorod array-surface enhanced raman spectroscopy biosensing platform was successfully applied for the detection of m pneumoniae in simulated and clinical throat swabs henderson et al 2014 2015 with the use of tools such as naats a greater understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of m pneumoniae is possible taken into account the results obtained in recent studies there is more evidence that real-time naats are superior to other m pneumoniae detection strategies during the early phase of infection naats however cannot completely replace serology in epidemiological studies serology is certainly more useful than for the management of individual patients with lrti or even cap since results are often delayed by the need for paired sera to detect a seroconversion or a significant rise in titer early in the course of an infection false-negative results often occur in case a specific igm test is used serology should not completely be abolished despite the fact that igm serology shows a moderate sensitivity nowadays a combination of the detection of igm antibodies and pcr may be the most optimal approach for early diagnosis of a m pneumoniae infection especially in children the implementation of quantitative tests could shed further light on the relation between bacterial load and the seriousness of the disease produce useful prognostic information and help in the differentiation between colonization and infection more information could be gathered on the length of the post infection carrier state as well as on the importance of subclinical infections and how prone these are for spreading infection it remains important to recognize the urgent need for the adoption of a more unified and consistent diagnostic approach for current and future investigations therefore a common set of recommendations should be developed the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as

k huw davies laurence corash m michael busch p philip felgner l saahir khan   covid-19 caused by the sars-cov-2 virus is a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates from 14 of confirmed cases1 the current case definition for confirmed sars-cov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive pharyngeal or respiratory specimens with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk however this case definition likely underestimates true prevalence as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested and testing by pcr of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens is only around 6080 sensitive depending on sampling location and technique and the patients viral load2 widespread testing within the united states is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories therefore the true prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection is likely much higher than currently reported case numbers would indicate serology can play an important role in defining the true prevalence of covid-19 particularly for subclinical infection2 early studies of serology demonstrate high sensitivity to detect confirmed sars-cov-2 infection with antibodies to virus detected approximately 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset3 unlike pcr positivity sars-cov-2 antibodies are detectable throughout the disease course and persist indefinitely4 multiple serologic tests have been developed for covid-195 including a recently fda-approved lateral flow assay however these tests are limited to detection of antibodies against one or two antigens and cross-reactivity with antibodies to other human coronaviruses that are present in all adults6 is currently unknown prior use of serology for detection of emerging coronaviruses focused on antibodies against the spike s protein particularly the s1 domain and the nucleocapsid n protein7 however the optimal set of antigens to detect strain-specific coronavirus antibodies remains unknown protein microarray technology can be used to detect antibodies of multiple isotypes against hundreds of antigens in a high throughput manner89 so is well suited to serologic surveillance studies this technology which has previously been applied to other emerging coronaviruses10 is based on detection of binding antibodies which are well-correlated with neutralizing antibodies11 but do not require viral culture in biosafety level 3 facilities recently our group developed a coronavirus antigen microarray covam that includes antigens from sars-cov-2 and tested it on human sera collected prior to the pandemic to demonstrate low cross-reactivity with antibodies from human coronaviruses that cause the common cold particularly for the s1 domain2 here we further validate this methodology using convalescent blood specimens from covid-19 cases confirmed by positive sars-cov-2 pcr the sars-cov-2 convalescent blood specimens from nasopharyngeal sars-cov-2 pcr-positive individuals were collected from different sources to increase the number of positive specimens available for analysis two sera and plasma samples were obtained from acute covid-19 patients from the oregon health sciences university hospital ohsu portland or these were sourced from discarded clinical laboratory specimens exempted from informed consent and irb approval under condition of patient anonymity four plasma samples were obtained from outpatients of the university hospital basel university of basel basel switzerland these patients were screened in accordance with swiss regulations on blood donation and approved as plasma donors according to the blood transfusion service of the swiss red cross with informed consent these donors were diagnosed with covid-19 based on sars-cov-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab pcr tests at time of plasma donation each had two negative nasopharyngeal swab sars-cov-2 pcr- tests and negative sars-cov-2 pcr tests in blood and they were qualified as plasma donors plasma was collected from these convalescent donors at the regional blood transfusion service of the swiss red cross in accordance with national regulations one convalescent plasma was isolated from a large-volume apheresis collection following standard protocol from a documented recovered covid-19 blood donor who was more than 28 days post symptomatic the negative control sera used in this study were collected between november 2018 and may 2019 for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in the eastern united states were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection ari cases using questionnaires and rt-qpcr so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections built environment and immunologic phenotypes12 a total of 144 de-identified blood specimens were tested on the cov antigen microarray electronic informed consents including future research use authorization was obtained under protocols approved by the institutional review boards irbs of the university of maryland and the department of navy human research protections office the coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or hek-293 cells table 1 these antigens were provided by sino inc wayne pa as either catalog products or custome synthesis service products the antigens were printed onto microarrays probed with human sera and analyzed as previously described91314 briefly lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 01 mgml in phosphate-buffered saline pbs with 0001 tween-20 t-pbs and then printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides from grace bio labs gbl bend or using an omnigrid 100 microarray printer genemachines the microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1100 in 1x gvs fast blocking buffer fischer scientific overnight at 4c washed with t-tbs buffer 20 mm tris-hcl 150 mm nacl 005 tween-20 in ddh2o adjusted to ph 75 and filtered 3 times for 5 minutes each labeled with secondary antibodies to human iga and igg conjugated to quantum dot fluorophores for 2 hours at room temperature and then washed with t-tbs 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried the slides were imaged using arraycam imager grace bio labs bend or to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysis the mean fluorescence intensity mfi of each antigen was determined by the average of the median fluorescence signal of four replicate spots the fluorescence signal for each spot was determined by its signal intensity subtracted by the background fluorescence antigens containing a human fc tag were removed from the analysis as the secondary antibodies used for quantification are known to bind to human fc non-human fc tag did not interfere with the assay all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 363 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria mfi was normalized using the normalizequantilesusetarget function from the proprocesscore package version 1480 as a target for normalization a vector containing the median mfi for igg or iga was constructed descriptive statistics were used to summarize the iga and igg reactivity measured as mfi wilcoxon rank sum tests with p  005 corrected for multiple comparisons were used to compare the mean differences between groups receiver operating characteristic area under the curve roc auc values for each antigen were calculated by comparing positive and negative specimens using the proc package version 1162 antigens were ranked based on their roc auc values and high performing antigens with roc auc  095 were identified data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package version 330 the coronavirus antigen microarray was used to detect igg and iga antibodies against a panel of antigens including coronavirus spike protein s as separated receptor-binding rbd s1 and s2 domains or whole protein s1s2 and nucleocapsid protein np from multiple coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov and the four common cold coronaviruses hku1 oc43 nl63 229e as listed in table 1 to determine the antibody profile of sars-cov-2 infection the differential reactivity to these antigens was evaluated for sars-cov-2 convalescent plasma from pcr-positive individuals positive group and sera collected prior to the covid-19 pandemic from nave individuals negative group as shown in figure 1 the positive group demonstrates high igg reactivity to sars-cov-2 np s2 and s1s2 antigens and moderate igg reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1 and rbd antigens while the negative group demonstrates low igg cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1s2 and no cross-reactivity to other sars-cov-2 antigens figure 2 the positive group also demonstrates high igg cross-reactivity with sars-cov np and mers-cov s2 and s1s2 antigens while the negative group demonstrates low cross-reactivity with mers-cov s1s2 and no cross-reactivity with other sars-cov and mers-cov antigens the two groups do not differ significantly in reactivity to common cold coronaviruses and other seasonally circulating respiratory viruses similar trends are observed for iga but with lower reactivity overall figure 3 the positive group again demonstrates high iga reactivity to sars-cov-2 np s2 and s1s2 and moderate iga reactivity to sars-cov-2 s1 with high iga cross-reactivity to sars-cov np while the negative group demonstrates low iga cross-reactivity to all sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov antigens each coronavirus antigen was evaluated for performance in discriminating the positive group from the negative group across a full range of assay cutoff values to generate receiver operating characteristic roc curves for which area under curve roc auc was measured figure 4 high-performing antigens for detection of igg or iga defined by roc auc  095 included all sars-cov-2 antigens and mers-cov s2 for igg and sars-cov-2 s2 and s1s2 for iga table 2 each of these antigens discriminated between the positive group and the negative group with high significance figure 5 this study reveals several insights into the antibody response to sars-cov-2 infection the antibody profiles of nave individuals include high igg reactivity to common cold coronaviruses with low-level cross-reactivity with s2 domains from sars-cov-2 and other epidemic coronaviruses which is not surprising given the high degree of sequence homology and previously observed serologic cross-reactivity15 between s2 domains of betacoronaviruses a group that includes sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers and common cold coronaviruses hku1 and oc43 however nave individuals do not show cross-reactivity to other sars-cov-2 antigens even for the nucleocapsid protein which also has high sequence homology between betacoronaviruses cross-reactivity is only seen between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov and not with mers-cov or common cold coronaviruses in addition the quantitative difference between high antibody reactivity to sars-cov-2 s2 in the positive group and low-level antibody cross-reactivity in the negative group is large enough that these antigens still discriminate these groups with high significance this study also informs antigen selection and design for population surveillance and clinical diagnostic assays and vaccine development the observation that nave individuals with antibodies to common cold coronaviruses do not show cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein dispels concerns that the high sequence homology of this protein across betacoronaviruses would impair its performance as a diagnostic or vaccine antigen the low-level antibody cross-reactivity of nave individuals for sarscov-2 spike protein containing s2 domain may not preclude its use as a diagnostic antigen given large quantitative difference in antibody reactivity between positive and negative groups but this cross-reactivity may influence response to vaccination with spike protein antigens containing the s2 domain the coronavirus antigen microarray can be useful both as an epidemiologic tool and as a research tool the high throughput detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibody profiles that reliably distinguish covid-19 cases from negative controls can be applied to large-scale population surveillance studies for a more accurate estimation of the true prevalence of disease than can be achieved with symptom-based pcr testing in addition detection of these antibodies in sars-cov-2 convalescent plasma donations can provide validation prior to clinical use for passive immunization the variation in the sars-cov-2 antibody profiles among acute and convalescent donors suggests that epitope characterization of convalescent donor plasma will be informative for evaluation of passive immune therapy efficacy in covid-19 patients the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe covid-1916 can be more closely studied by analyzing both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibody responses particularly to test hypotheses regarding antibody-dependent enhancement with critical implications for vaccine development17 a coronavirus antigen microarray containing a panel of antigens from sars-cov-2 in addition to other human coronaviruses was able to reliably distinguish convalescent plasma of pcr-positive covid-19 cases from negative control sera collected prior to the pandemic by detecting both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibodies further studies are needed to apply this methodology to large-scale serologic surveillance studies and to correlate specific antibody

allowing the determination of the serostatus of patients 3  the sars-cov-2 serology was implemented and used for patients care since 14 th april 2020 in our laboratory of microbiology located at the centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois  chuv initially only few indications were recognized by public health authorities but we rapidly extended these indications to include the list detailed in table 1  our laboratory performed a prospective surveillance of the sars-cov-2 serologic test requested during the first 5 weeks by specifically looking at rate of the different accepted indications we also prospectively checked for a sudden increase in testing requests from a specific ward of our university hospital andor from a tertiary hospital a private clinic or a specific private practitioner finally we also identified prospectively new valid indications the aims of this work were i to precise the diversity and proportion of indications for the sars-cov-2 serological test and ii to report any deviation of its usage from the 14 th april 2020 to 18 th may 2020 686 sars-cov-2 serological tests were performed in our laboratory using the epitope diagnostics igg elisa san diego

requests  figure 2d  the residuals symptoms with no documented or negative rt-pcr indication n64 appeared to be very important for patient care but was totally unexpected since on 14 th april when we started the sars-cov-2 serology the occurrence of such post-infectious complications were not yet reported 5  today such late complications appear to be common and typical of covid-19 6 7 8  one of the main limitation of this work is the short studied period which do not include possible much later onset complications necessitating a serological investigation some of the indications that we expected such as i investigation of thrombo-embolic events and ii investigations of chronic fatigue syndrome were not recorded likely due to the relatively small number of subjects the lack of information for most serologies requested by private practitioners and the early timing of this work as compared to the outbreak reducing the number of cases with late complications thus this work should be extended over the next 6 to 12 months overall this work demonstrates the good adequacy of serological requests indeed at least the in-hospita l doctors largely complied with in-house guidelines and did not sent serology requests only for scientific interest or personal interest this work may serve as a seed for international guidelines regarding the indications of sars-cov-2

and serology antibody neutralizing antibody seroconversion rapid testing igg igm iga lfd elisa prnt chemiluminescence and immunochromatography as of june 2 2020 a total of 55 papers with performance data of serologic techniques were examined the assays utilized in these studies included the neutralizing antibody assay enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa automated chemiluminescence immunoassay clia and lateral flow immunoassay lfia thirty-two papers were peer-reviewed publications and 23 preprints were not peer-reviewed medrxiv 22 biorxiv 1 the compiled information included the assay method with a focus on the detection of particular isotypes of antibody and selection of targeted antigens in addition the composition of cohorts of samples used in the validation studies was examined with focus on control groups details regarding the time of sample acquisition and characteristics of the clinical disease of confirmed sars-cov-2 patients were also recorded when available lastly calculated test accuracy and information regarding comparison to other immunoassays and rt-pcr testing was noted two independent reviewers from the department of pathology and laboratory medicine and department of hematology at the university of miami and jackson health system extracted the information the variable sensitivity and specificity of lfia have been the focus of the media and numerous studies due to the growing number of commercially available devices617 several investigations reported high sensitivity and specificity of these assays although many lacked information regarding the target antigens and well-defined negative control groups ie human coronavirus controls table 1 summarizes the review of studies using lfia methods6718-29 the experimental design and data of 7 studies were judged to provide insight into lfia method applications li et al7 evaluated a combined igmigg lfia using the rbd antigen in a sample set obtained from 397 positive patients defined by positive rt-pcr and covid-19 symptoms and 128 negative patients the assay sensitivity was 89 and the specificity was 91 notably 64 of the samples from the positive patient group demonstrated both igm and igg reactivity lou et al22 reported the use of 3 different lfia igm and total antibody using rbd antigen and igg detection using np antigen using a large group of covid-19negative patient samples n  209 but not a control group of samples from patients with other viral infections or diseases an excellent specificity ranging from 95 to 100 was reported for all 3 devices notably the sensitivity of the total antibody lfia had the highest performance at 98 also the performance of all the assays compared well with similarly constructed and validated elisa in the same study using 147 control samples from patients with various viral infections and 93 samples from covid-19 patients geurtsvankessel et al26 reviewed 3 lfia including the cellex this device uses a combination of sp and np antigens the sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 87 and 81 for igm detection and 84 and 85 for igg detection respectively interestingly the orient lfia also constructed with the same 2 antigens showed a sensitivity of 89 for igm detection and 92 for igg detection the assay specificity for each isotype was 100 but it should be noted that the latter study tested a very small sample set of negative controls another study utilized samples from both negative patients and patients with other viral infections and examined 6 lfia devices18 although no target antigen information was presented the patient sample sets were robust while evaluation of 2 of the lfia demonstrated a poor performance the remaining devices demonstrated 83 to 93 sensitivity and 100 specificity values lastly traugott et al28 presented data regarding 2 lfia with specificity ranging from 98 100 but sensitivity was reported as poor at less than 5 days post onset of symptoms 13-20 poor to moderate at days 6 to 10 20-80 and excellent at or after day 11 100 one study examined the accuracy of 10 different lfia and 2 elisa immunoassays using samples obtained from covid-19 patients at different time points of disease6 specificity was assessed using 108 samples from healthy subjects and 52 samples from patients with other respiratory illnesses not specified the highest detection rate observed using lfia devices was obtained with combined igm and igg detection accuracy peaked at days 16 to 20 post onset of symptoms with sensitivity results greater than 80 and specificity results greater than 95 notably this study reported several false-positive results obtained from banked specimens collected before the pandemic these false-positive results suggest nonspecific binding by plasma proteins or cross-reactivity with antibodies produced during other viral infections in a separate study of 7 lfia devices van elslande et al29 also used a secondary set of 103 control samples to assess assay performance and reported a range of 97 to 100 specificity with the combination of positive igm and igg results but an 85 to 98 range of specificity when only igm or igg positive results were used in their study sensitivity was also reported to vary with the timing of sample acquisition post onset of symptoms lfia is an appealing platform for sars-cov-2 testing with a relatively low cost per test and the advantage of potential use for point-of-care testing30 lfia described in the literature thus far provided results for both igm and igg the majority of the reports demonstrated a higher sensitivity and specificity with the detection of both isotypes and a higher specificity was observed with the detection of the igg isotype over the detection of the igm isotype alone antigens frequently used in lfia include np rbd and combined use of np and sp a superior test accuracy based on the use of specific target antigens was not evident at this time studies utilizing samples obtained at various time points demonstrated the accuracy of lfia was optimal at approximately 2 weeks post onset of symptoms overall the understanding of the limitations or advantages for the implementation of lfia-based assays is severely impacted by the presence of only a few properly designed studies in the current literature table 1 publications that described elisa method validation often sought to address which antigens and antibody isotypes provided the best sensitivity and specificity table 2618192226-2831-40 in many of these studies these calculations were reported solely to compare the performance of different antigens or the detection of different isotypes and not necessarily to propose the use of the assay for clinical implementation additionally as noted in table 2 many investigations utilized the elisa method to study the timeline of antibody expression in sars-cov-2 patients to date few investigations have focused on immunoassays utilizing the full sp antigen3134 the sp antigen includes the rbd antigen as well as other essential peptides that may be the target of the humoral immune response amanat et al31 generated 2 different versions of the sars-cov-2 spike protein one construct expressed the full length of sp and a second construct presented only the rbd evaluating a small number of samples from rt-pcrpositive patients reactivity to both antigens was excellent as demonstrated by optical density values however sp reactivity was significantly higher than that observed for rbd igg3 igm and iga were the dominant isotypes observed in these patient samples the investigators further reported that reactivity to a sample bank of sera obtained from patients with other human coronavirus infections was negligible okba et al34 produced an array of different elisa to examine antibody reactivity to sp s1 np and rbd antigens a large cohort of samples was obtained from patients with other viral respiratory infections and was inclusive of 116 banked samples from patients infected with various human coronaviruses only samples from some sars-cov and mers-cov patients cross-reacted with the sars-cov-2 antigens the rbd and np elisa were the most effective in the detection of antibodies in patients with mild infection these 2 antigens were examined in a second study using samples obtained from a cohort of 16 patients obtained 14 days or longer after symptom onset38 the rbd elisa showed higher sensitivity 100 for igg and 94 for igm compared to the np elisa 94 for igg and 88 for igm okba et al34 also examined commercial elisa using the s1 antigen for the detection of iga and igg antibodies both elisa showed some cross-reactivity with samples obtained from other human coronavirus positive patients overall the iga elisa displayed a higher sensitivity and the igg elisa displayed a higher specificity lassaunire et al18 evaluated elisa constructed with rbd and s1 antigens using a control group of samples from patients with other nonsars-cov-2 viral infections the performance of a sandwich elisa for the detection of total antibody reactivity to rbd was superior to that observed for the commercial igg and iga elisa using the s1 antigen the elisa for total antibody detection provided the highest sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 100 respectively the specificity of the igg and iga assays were similar but the iga elisa had a superior sensitivity of 93 vs 67 for igg the authors reported a similar cross-reactivity of the commercial s1 elisa to other human coronaviruses as observed by okba et al34 zhao et al33 also utilized a sandwich elisa to measure total antibody reactivity to rbd antigen as well as a rbd targeted elisa to measure igm reactivity alone and a np targeted elisa to detect igg reactivity examining a cohort of over 300 patient samples the total antibody assay had superior performance vs the other assays with a sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 99 respectively while the specificity of the igm and igg elisa was 99 the sensitivity of the igg elisa np was 65 compared to the igm elisa rbd at 83 whitman et al6 evaluated 2 different elisa and 10 different lfia in their study the sensitivity for the elisa assays using samples obtained after day 16 post onset of symptoms was greater than 80 and the specificity was greater than 95 the agreement of the elisa with different lfia ranged from 75 to 95 overall elisa assays with rbd and np antigens were the most frequently used in these early studies although the sensitivity of the assays was affected by the timing of sample acquisition a higher overall sensitivity was consistently observed with the use of total antibody detection the elisa technique is labor intensive and unsuitable for point-of-care testing however it may offer the advantage of determining antibody titers and selective isotype detection the importance of these options as clinical applications is unknown at this time overall while several elisa-based studies were robust in experimental design many reports did not include examination of important control samples to best evaluate method specificity table 2 the use of clia in the detection of sars-cov-2 antibody is of particular interest as this method has excellent sensitivity with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the detection of other viral infections clia uses recombinant antigen coated magnetic beads and a lumigen substrate with analysis on automated platforms in current reports np combined np and sp and rbd antigens were most commonly used table 3822262741-46 many studies utilized clia to address differences in patient populations and time of onset of symptoms vs serologic results long et al42 reported the use of the np and sp antigen combination in a study of 363 samples from confirmed and suspect covid-19 patients in their report igg-positive serostatus approached 100 at 20 days after onset of symptoms and the median seroconversion for igm and igg was 13 days using a similar np and sp assay but a smaller cohort of positive and negative patients jin et al8 reported a 48 sensitivity and 100 specificity for igm detection however for igg the reported sensitivity was 89 and specificity was 91 accuracy was higher for combined igm and igg testing with a posterior probability of greater than 99 this was followed by igg alone 90 and igm alone 86 and was corroborated in a separate study47 five studies warranted a closer examination as each included control samples from patients with non-sars-cov-2 infections lin et al43 used np antigen to detect igm and igg reactivity sensitivity for both igm and igg assays was reported as 82 and the specificity was 81 for igm detection and 98 for igg detection ma et al44 compared rbd and np antigen targeted clia and reported a higher sensitivity and specificity when using the rbd antigen a superior sensitivity and specificity were also demonstrated with the detection of iga over igm or igg detection alone in addition the use of iga in tandem with the detection of either igm or igg increased assay sensitivity and specificity geurtsvankessel et al26 examined a total antibody assay for s1s2 reactivity and reported a sensitivity of 73 and a specificity of 98 bryan et al46 validated an igg antibody assay using np antigen with a specificity of 100 based on the analysis of banked samples originally submitted for hsv testing this study also included 689 samples from confirmed covid-19 patients the assay sensitivity increased from 53 at day 7 to 100 at day 17 lastly zhang et al41 used a large cohort of samples and showed an area under the curve of 099 and 100 for igm and igg respectively using a combined np and sp clia the clia assay is traditionally considered a very sensitive method with the capability to detect low levels of antibodies clia assays are automated and allow for a high throughput of samples in the current literature review rbd and np were the most commonly targeted antigens and the studies detected igm and igg isotypes as well as total antibody reactivity the use of rbd antigen and igg detection produced the highest accuracy data among studies it is important to consider that the variation in performance among different platforms may have been related to sample acquisition timing which was not consistently reported in the studies rt-pcr testing for viral detection is a frontline tool to detect patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection however several studies showed that the sensitivity of rt-pcr testing decreased over time post onset of symptoms and that this change was observed to be concurrent with the increasing sensitivity of antibody detection methods guo et al32 evaluated the use of a np targeted elisa using igm iga and igg detection in a sample set of 82 rt-pcr confirmed cases and 58 suspected cases with negative rt-pcr early in disease 5 days post onset of symptoms igm detection was positive in 93 of suspected cases with negative rt-pcr results and 76 of the rt-pcr confirmed cases overall the sensitivity of rt-pcr testing alone was 52 however when using rt-pcr in combination with the elisa the total sensitivity increased to 99 similar results were observed in another study where combined detection of igg and igm identified over 70 of suspected cases that were negative by rt-pcr testing38 as the course of the disease progresses the utility of serology increases as well zhao et al33 evaluated the sensitivity of a total antibody elisa to the rbd antigen in the early 1-7 days post onset of symptoms the sensitivity was 67 for rt-pcr this increased to 79 when rt-pcr was combined with elisa testing the sensitivity for rt-pcr decreased to 54 at days 8 to 14 while the elisa sensitivity increased to 90 at this time point the use of both methods resulted in a sensitivity of 97 lastly on days 15 to 39 rt-pcr sensitivity was reported as 46 and the elisa sensitivity was 100 similar trends were also observed with an igm rbd elisa and igg np elisa numerous studies indicated that antibody responses may vary according to disease severity and some reports proposed that monitoring titers may be applied in clinical practice to guide earlier aggressive treatment traditionally the hallmarks of a humoral immune response include the early expression of igm isotype which then matures into igg isotype expression notably many reports of sars-cov-2 patients indicated that igm expression was observed concurrently with igg expression long et al42 conducted a large multicenter study using an np and sp targeted clia the median seroconversion of both isotypes was recorded at day 13 in addition a different np and sp targeted clia studied by suhandynanata et al45 showed a median seroconversion on days 4 to 5 for igm and igg the goal of several elisa studies was to define the period of seroconversion and all demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the assays by the second week post onset of symptoms20283233 zhao et al33 reported that the median seroconversion time of igm and igg to rbd antigen was days 12 and 14 respectively guo et al32 reported the median appearance of igm and iga at day 5 and igg at day 14 post symptom onset their study used serial samples obtained from the same patients and an elisa for antibody detection to the np antigen xiang et al20 also used a np targeted elisa and reported the median appearance of antibody at day 4 post onset of symptoms overall while these results are similar to that reported in a review of serologic testing for mers-cov and sars-cov they may have been affected by choice of target antigens the various immunoassay kits and the level of detail of case history used to categorize the time of sample acquisition post onset of symptoms14 few studies have examined the differences in titers by case severity classification and there was no consensus among the findings tan et al49 reported that the igg and igm detection occurred earlier for severe cases compared to nonsevere cases p  05 higher titers were also observed in the former group wang et al50 evaluated the titers of igm and igg in 116 confirmed cases of which 101 of the cases had mild to moderate disease and 15 patients died levels of igm were significantly higher in deceased patients p  019 however no significant correlation was observed between case outcome and igg titers in contrast a large study of 338 confirmed covid-19 patients reported elevated igm titers but lower igg levels in critical cases51 ma et al44 evaluated iga titers in a cohort of 216 patients and observed a significant correlation with disease severity p  0001 and peak levels of iga 16 to 20 days after symptom onset sun et al40 reported significantly higher igg titers to sp antigen in non-icu patients whereas igg titers to np antigen were elevated in icu patients lastly to et al38 using np and rbd targeted elisa observed no correlation between titers and severity previously quantification performed by elisa and neutralizing antibody assays showed that individuals over 60 years of age had higher antibody titers than young healthy adults with human coronavirus nonsars-cov-2 infection52 notably in a study of patients recovered from covid-19 samples obtained from elderly and middle-aged individuals had higher titers of sp reactive antibody compared to young adults53 thus while increased age is often associated with severe sars-cov-2 disease and poor outcomes high levels of antibody production do not appear to be detrimental given these preliminary reports there were limited reports of testing approaches for the detection of asymptomatic individuals much of the current literature was weakened given the limitations in the experimental design of studies used to validate the serologic methods for example paradiso et al54 used an lfia for igm and igg detection to screen 525 health care workers previously this group reported an overall 30 sensitivity and 89 specificity obtained during the validation of this lfia it was acknowledged that the reduced sensitivity was related to the selection of validation samples from patients early after the onset of symptoms21 in the health care worker screening study only 11 of the cases were seropositive these cases tested negative by rt-pcr all the cases were positive for igm and 1 case was positive for both igm and igg another study from the same investigation group examined asymptomatic cases presenting to the emergency department21 twenty nine percent of the cases were positive by rt-pcr testing and 21 of the cases were positive by lfia testing as the lfia was not fully validated it is problematic to apply these results to develop screening strategies for asymptomatic patients bendavid et al55 used lfia in a study of 3330 individuals from santa clara county ca and found an unadjusted antibody prevalence of 15 95 confidence interval ci 111-197 the weighted population prevalence was 28 95 ci 224-33755 the kit was validated using samples from confirmed negative and positive sars-cov-2 patients with a combined igmigg sensitivity of 80 and specificity of 99 no secondary controls with nonsars-cov-2 viral infections were included in the validation study as a result this study likely overestimated the specificity of this lfia zhao et al39 used a lab-developed elisa for the detection of igg antibody to s1 antigen with reported excellent sensitivity and specificity as determined by the use of samples from symptomatic hospitalized patients and healthy individuals in a subsequent study the same elisa was examined in 276 asymptomatic health care workers ten percent of health care workers had seropositive results samples from a small cohort of close contact individuals were also examined all subjects tested negative by rt-pcr but 1 individual was seropositive as with the study by bendavid et al55 the specificity of the elisa assay was not fully assessed this complicates the interpretation of these results a report of serologic testing of a family cluster of 6 individuals provided interesting data regarding the complexity of test sensitivity56 two family members were hospitalized with sars-cov-2 symptoms one individual tested positive by rt-pcr on presentation and the second patient tested negative twice before obtaining a positive result on day 5 both individuals were positive for igm reactivity by elisa the 4 remaining family members remained asymptomatic however 3 of 4 tested positive for igm reactivity and 2 of 3 were positive by rt-pcr testing at later dates the fourth individual remained clinically asymptomatic and was negative on all testing implementation of serology testing to screen the general population and asymptomatic health care workers is currently of significant interest nonetheless the available evidence is limited to support its use in these scenarios with unclear population prevalence and the use of immunoassays that are not fully validated the limitations of test sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of asymptomatic individuals may be difficult to overcome57 many studies focused on the detection of neutralizing antibodies for the potential use as a predictor of clinical outcome and in the identification of convalescent serum for use in a treatment strategy several of these studies evaluated the correlation of data from elisa using rbd s1 s2 and np antigens to the presence of neutralizing antibodies wu et al53 studied neutralizing antibodies using a pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based assay using plasmids for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 sp protein titers of neutralizing antibodies were reported as id50 highest dilution resulting in 50 reduction of luciferase luminescence parallel elisa for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rbd s1 and s2 were conducted the study samples were obtained from 175 patients with mild to moderate symptoms who recovered from covid-19 levels of neutralizing antibodies were low id50 200 before day 10 and appeared at 10 to 15 days after the onset of symptoms titers persisted at similar levels on repeat testing 2 weeks later the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the patients were categorized as follows low to mid in 17 id50 500-999 mid to high 39 id50 1000-2500 and high in 14 id50 2500 samples from 30 of patients had very low levels id50 500 and included samples from 10 patients who had reactivity below the level of detection id50 40 results obtained from elisa using rbd s1 and s2 antigens correlated moderately with neutralizing antibody titers correlation coefficients ranged from 042 to 051 p  0001 ni et al37 examined rbd and np elisa in tandem with the pseudovirus neutralization test in cohorts of 6 patients tested at the time of discharge and 2 weeks later significant levels of igm and igg were present at both time points as determined by elisa methods notably while neutralizing antibody was detected at the time of discharge levels were lower in 5 of 6 patients 2 weeks later okba et al34 compared the results of iga and igg elisa for rbd s1 and np to data obtained from a plaque reduction neutralization assay using vero e6 cells and reported a significant correlation r  088 p  01 with all elisa the strongest correlation was observed with iga reactivity r  093 p  001 it is important to note that various elisa in this study were validated with a large secondary sample set obtained from patients with other respiratory viral infections table 2 the identification of novel antigenic epitopes that may be important in the humoral immune response was the focus of a limited number of studies poh et al13 evaluated the reactivity of 25 convalescent serum samples six samples showed significant neutralization activity id50 600 and were selected for further analysis additional experiments to characterize antigen targets showed that the s14 and s21 peptides within the sp provided the strongest reactivity by elisa methods and these results correlated with neutralizing activity jiang at al58 developed a microarray of 28 sars-cov-2 proteins to profile iggigm responses of 29 convalescent sera all patients had combined igmigg responses to np and s1 antigens but not to s2 antigen furthermore a significant number of samples were positive for anti-orf9b and anti-nsp5 antibodies these peptides may represent good predictors for immunity and possible therapeutic targets overall understanding the utility of routine serologic methods ie elisa clia in the prediction of convalescence is complex further comprehensive studies in this area are warranted numerous immunoassays for the detection of antibodies to sars-cov-2 are rapidly emerging these immunoassays have the potential to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of infection in different scenarios1759-61 published and nonpeer-reviewed studies varied dramatically in the definition of patient groups time of sample acquisition sample size and inclusion of relevant control sera from patients with nonsars-cov-2 respiratory infections these are all critical variables that will affect the sensitivity and specificity of the different immunoassays and should be a fundamental part of the review of any validated assay15 determining the final roles of lfia and elisa immunoassays in sars-cov-2 testing and research is difficult at this time as this is limited by the pitfalls in the experimental design of many of these foundational studies further well-validated assays determined through studies with rigorous experimental design are needed in the current literature the study methods were heterogeneous regarding the specific antigens used and the different isotypes of antibodies measured few studies compared these variables simultaneously the most common antigens used in the assays included rbd s1 and np there was preliminary evidence that the use of particular target antigens may provide value to increase the sensitivity of antibody detection methods however additional comprehensive studies need to be conducted to reproduce this early reported data in addition antigenic epitopes within the sp appeared to be important in the immune response and thus this region remains of interest for future detailed studies there is compelling evidence that using total antibody or combined iggigm detection offered the highest sensitivity of detection data from preliminary studies indicated that additional investigations should examine the clinical correlation of different isotypes and titers to disease severity it is also clear that the timing of sample acquisition is a crucial determinant of test accuracy although this important information was not always clearly presented in the current literature16 the earliest positive results were reported by day 5 post onset of symptoms and accuracy peaked by the second week of symptoms early in the course of the disease when rt-pcr sensitivity was reported as 50 to 60 the concomitant use of serologic tests significantly added sensitivity with consistently reported values over 90 moreover after 10 to 14 days post onset of symptoms the sensitivity of rt-pcr dropped significantly while serology testing reached its peak as fully validated methods become commercially available serology methods may be utilized as an adjunct tool to rt-pcr testing protocols in patients with suspected infection nearly all of the current literature focused on the results obtained using serologic testing in symptomatic patients it will be essential to define antibody responses in individuals with subclinical and mild disease before immunoassays can be used in screening and seroprevalence studies at the time of this writing while the potential importance of quantitative titers was raised in the literature testing platforms available to provide this information are largely absent from clinical laboratories lastly defining convalescence and the presence of long-lasting immunity to sars-cov-2 after infection or future vaccination is important additional studies are needed to determine if ease-of-use assays of antibody detection and quantitation will compare well with traditional neutralizing antibody assays while serologic testing continues to hold promise for various applications there are still knowledge gaps that must be clarified to give meaningful recommendations for its use in different clinical scenarios  comparative serological study for the prevalence of anti-mers coronavirus antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in qatar reham al kahlout a gheyath nasrallah k elmoubasher farag a lingshu wang erik lattwein marcel mller a mohamed el zowalaty e hamad al romaihi e barney graham s asmaa al thani a hadi yassine m   middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a human beta-coronavirus hcov that is originally identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa in 2012 so far the who has reported 2229 cases of mers-cov infections in 27 countries with a fatality rate of about 36 n  791 1 mers-cov-specific antibodies are widely found in dromedary camels camelus dromedarius along with viral shedding of similar viruses detected in human accordingly dromedaries are considered the primary source of mers-cov transmission to humans although the original source for the virus is still unknown 24 phylogenetic analysis groups coronaviruses into four genera alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-coronaviruses bats are considered the natural reservoirs of these viruses although sars-cov is closely related to bat cov btcov hku3 and mers-cov is closely related to pipistrellus btcov hku5 and tylonycteris btcov hku4 the serologic and antigenic relationship between these viruses is unclear generally coronaviruses across subgroups demonstrate a low level of cross-reactivity for the s protein and limited preservation of cross-neutralizing epitopes 5 6 however few studies have demonstrated cross-reactivity among these betacoronavirus it has been shown that mouse hyperimmune sera to sars-cov harbor low levels of neutralizing activity against mers-cov 5 further sera samples from sars patients demonstrated 607 1728 binding and 25 728 neutralizing activities to mers-cov suggesting cross-reactivity within subgroup viruses 7 following its first isolation several laboratory diagnostic tests for mers-cov have been developed 811 molecular tests such as rt-pcr and sequencing are majorly used in diagnosing mers-cov infections 12 the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc limits the use of serological tests for investigational or surveillance settings and not for diagnosis 13 they established a two-phase serological test approach to detect anti-mers antibodies based on elisa targeting s1 antigen followed by whole-virus igg and igm iift and microneutralization test for confirmation the microneutralization assay is highly specific and it is the gold standard for measuring specific neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov in sera samples nonetheless compared with the elisa and iift the microneutralization assay requires a bsl3 facility which is not available at many places and it is labor-intensive and time-consuming requiring at least 5 days before results are available 13 14 in the state of qatar twenty-one cases have been reported until 2017 including seven deaths 333 interestingly 95 n  20 of the cases in qatar were reported in males compared to only one female case thirteen of the mers cases were reported in camel farm owners and workers and five were suspected human-to-human transmissions of which three were nosocomial infections ministry of public health-qatar personal communication qatar was the first nation to report on the isolation and full genome sequencing of mers-cov from camels 3 in a separate study from qatar reusken et al reported that  7 20294 of persons with camel contact have antibodies reactive with mers-cov s1 antigen compared to zero reactive in control or noncase contact samples using 90 plaque-reduction neutralization test prnt90 only 10 of the 20 5 mers-cov s1 antibody-reactive samples were confirmed positive 15 due to the uncertain epidemiological picture of mers-cov among qatar population we designed a staged serologic surveillance study for mers-cov consisting of initial screening by anti-mers-cov igg rs1-elisa kit followed by evaluation of reactive samples using whole-virus indirect immunofluorescence assays igm- and igg-iift and ppnt we also tested the cross-reactivity of igg rs1-elisa-reactive samples with the four circulating human coronaviruses using elisa and iift this study targeted three groups i low-risk group constituted of 4719 samples obtained from blood donors bd collected over a period of five years 2012-2016 ii high-risk group represented by 135 samples obtained from baseline case contacts cc collected from individuals who were in close contact with confirmed cases during the acute phase first week and iii four samples from pcr-confirmed mers-cov patients cp the high-risk group is defined by the individuals that were in direct contact with the confirmed cases either at work house or hospital medical staff prior or after symptom development our findings suggest that mers-cov is not heavily circulated among the population of qatar additionally the presence of antibody responses to other human coronaviruses resulted in false-positive results in binding assays which mandate the need for more evaluation studies of the currently available diagnostic serological assays in total 4858 plasma samples were analyzed in this study samples were distributed as follows 4719 plasma samples were collected from bd during previous studies 1620 over a period of five years 2012-2016 age 19-88 years mean age 37 years 135 plasma samples were collected from individuals that were in cc to four cp age 14-49 years mean age 31 years and four plasma samples were collected from

initial screening for anti-mers-cov antibodies using igg rs1-elisa revealed 104719 021 and 1135 074 reactive samples from bd three borderline and seven positive samples and cc respectively on the other hand 34 cp 750 were reactive with igg rs1-elisa assay figure 1 table 2 since cc samples were collected within the first week of primary case identification samples were also tested by igm-iift and all were negative as recommended by the who borderline and reactive samples were then tested for the presence of anti-mers-cov igg using whole-virus and recombinant r s1-iift analysis with whole-virus igg-iift confirmed only two 210 samples from bd as well as three 34 samples from cp interestingly none 010 of the above bd reactive samples tested positive with neither rs1-iift nor ppnt assay the positive igg rs1-elisa cc sample was only tested by ppnt and it was positive all of the randomly selected igg rs1-elisa negative bd samples were also negative by whole-virus and rs1 igg-iift tables 3 and 4 to determine the status of infection recent versus older all igg rs1-elisa reactive samples were further evaluated for the presence of igm antibodies as an indication for recent infections using whole-virus iift igm-iift and only one was marginally reactive and that was from a cp table 4 strikingly one of the 13 randomly selected igg rs1-elisa igg-negative bd samples from the initial screening was found reactive for igm antibodies using igm-iift with a titer of 320 positivity of this sample was further confirmed with ppnt with ec50 titer of 500 table 3 the sample was obtained from a 35-year-old syrian citizen residing in qatar discrepancies in the results obtained from different binding assays could be due to cross-reactivity with other viruses hence we evaluated the cross-reactivity of rs1-elisa-reactive samples for igg antibodies against all currently known human coronaviruses all tested bd samples including the negative controls from the initial screening exhibited reactivity to at least 3 of 4 human coronaviruses all rs1-elisa-reactive samples were reactive to the four seasonal coronaviruses 229e hku1 oc43-cov and nl63 table 5 the reactivity was also high in the negative controls from the initial screening reaching 100 1313 for 229e 92 1213 for hku1 and oc43 and 84 1113 for nl63 partial data is shown in table 5 none of the tested bd samples were reactive to sars-cov using whole-virus or rs1-iift igg similarly all samples from cp were also highly reactive with other human coronaviruses interestingly two of the cp samples had considerable reactivity to sars-cov with titers of 320 and 3200 using igg rs1-iift table 5 discrepancies in cross-reactivity were also observed among different serological tests for human coronaviruses for example one sample from cp tested negative with whole-virus iift igg for hcov-229e but it was reactive with recombinant s1 protein of the same virus using similar assay similarly two samples from cp showed reactivity to sars-cov in the igg rs1-iift whereas only the sample with higher antibody titer reacted with the whole-virus igg-iift assay further all samples from cp reacted with hku1 spike protein in rs1-elisa but only two samples yielded positive reaction with the igg rs1-iift table 5 qatar reported a relatively low number of mers cases in comparison to neighboring countries despite the fact that mers-cov continues to circulate in camels 23 24 in the absence of a clear epidemiological view of mers-cov we present here a comparative serological study for the prevalence of anti-mers coronavirus antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in qatar following the who recommendation we run initial screening for igg antibodies using rs1-elisa and reactive samples were then confirmed with full virus and rs1-iift igg followed by ppnt combined results from different serological tests indicate the low presence of neutralizing anti-mers-cov antibodies in the general population in qatar 14719 while the rate increases to 1  135 in the high-risk group cc our results revealed a few interesting observations first the only confirmed positive sample from the bd group was accidentally detected when we tested 13 randomly selected negative samples originally selected to serve as a negative control from the initial screening using rs1-elisa-igg for igm response where screening for igm is not typically done in similar studies 14 this mandates the development and utilization of assays that measure both classes of the antibodies for screening processes nonetheless our results coincide with the low number of reported cases in qatar n  21 compared to the neighboring countries such saudi arabia that has the highest number of reported mers cases worldwide n  1700 25 26 in a similar study using a similar approach in saudi arabia 1510009 015 were confirmed positive for anti-mers antibodies in the general population these numbers are slightly higher than what we observed in our study 14719 002 however the low number of positive samples in both studies prevents a significant statistical analysis 14 another interesting observation was the seropositivity in cc samples although those samples were collected within the first week of primary case identification only one sample was positive for igg but not for igm antibodies indicating previous exposure to the virus it also confirms that infection with mers-cov can go unnoticed and that surveillance studies shall be done systematically to include screening for igm and igg responses similar to the above observation in the general population the rate of seropositivity in the high-risk group cc in our analysis was lower 1135 074 than that observed in saudi arabia 7227 308 several factors could explain the difference between both studies including the difference in sample size as well as the demographics and livestock population in both countries one out of four mers cp samples did not show antibody response using rs1-elisa whole virus and rs1-iift assays the sample was collected during the acute infection phase which explains the absence of anti-mers-cov igg response a recent study from south korea indicated that humoral response to mers-cov as measured by binding and neutralizing assays wean rapidly after one year of infection and becomes undetectable in about 67 of those who show mild illness upon infection 27 in another study from korea it was shown that none of the asymptomatically infected individuals showed seroconversion however the seroconversion rates gradually increased with increasing disease severity reaching 600 938 and 100 in symptomatic infection without pneumonia pneumonia without respiratory failure and pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure respectively 28 such studies indicate that human humoral immune response to mers-cov is a complicated phenomenon that requires further investigation it further implies that the infection rate with mers-cov in the middle east could be underestimated and that the fatality rate associated with mers-cov infection is most likely overestimated as observed in other studies the rs1-elisa resulted in significant false-positive results while 104719 02 samples were positive in this assay only 210 20 were positive with whole-virus igg-iift and null were confirmed with rs1-iift and ppnt 0 similarly out of 10009 tested samples in the saudi arabia study 152 were positive with rs1-elisa 15 17 of which 11 were positive with whole-virus iift and 15 were confirmed with neutralization assay 14 these results indicate cross-reactivity between mers-cov and other human coronaviruses to test this further we employed several binding assays to test the reactivity of our samples with five known human coronaviruses namely sars hku1 229e oc43 and nl63 cov interestingly all mers-reactive samples from first screening as well as most of the randomly selected negative control samples had cross-reactivity to at least 34 seasonal human viruses but none of them were cross-reactive with sars-cov on the other hand two of the cp samples were cross-reactive with sars-cov with intermediate titers accordingly it is not clear which of the human coronavirus is inducing this cross-reactivity with mers-cov which mandates further investigation we also observed discrepancies in cross-reactivity when using different assays where rs1-based iift were more sensitive than full virus counterparts that could be due to the higher concentration of the specific s1 protein in the first assay which also ensures the use of defined regents purified proteins for developing screening assays on the other hand cross-reactivity between sars and mers-cov has been reported earlier a 2013 study by chan et al indicated that 1728 607 of sars patients had significant binding antibody titers using iift of which seven 25 had anti-mers emc neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of hcov-oc43 7 in the same study bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant b-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of spike protein between the two viruses 7 we acknowledge few limitations to our study including the use of elisa procedure to screen for anti-mers-cov igg response dominance of males over females 4642 versus 77 and non-qataris over qataris 3791 versus 928 as well as the screening at one-time point our findings affirm on the use of neutralization assay and to a lower extent spike protein-specific iift as confirmatory tests considering the high cross-reactivity among different human coronaviruses such findings were similar to what has been recently reported by drosten et al who showed that excess in igg detection by anti-mers rs1-elisa igg was not confirmed with igg-iift assay 29 our results indicate a high discrepancy between different assays available in the market to screen for anti-mers-cov antibodies elisa-based assay seems to be more prone to produce false-positive results while results of iift should always be confirmed by neutralization test most of the available elisa assays utilize s1 protein which is part of the whole protein and in many cases is not well characterized before use using affinity purified and structurally defined protein might be more reliable to produce accurate results the recent determination of several ectodomain structures from many coronaviruses should be instrumental to design better immunogens 3036 which can also be utilized to develop more specific screening assays lastly further investigation of the possibility of mers-cov transmission through a blood transfusion from asymptomatic donors should also be assessed though no cases have been reported so far with evidence of blood transfusion as a source of mers-cov infection  diagnostic strategies for sars-cov-2 infection and interpretation of microbiological results giorgia caruana antony croxatto alix coste t onya opota frederic lamoth katia jaton gilbert greub   in december 2019 numerous cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan china 1 in january the novel causative virus named sars-cov-2 was identified which spread to other chinese regions and to other countries causing a world pandemic 23 the clinical presentation of this disease named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 varied from asymptomatic or mild flu-like symptoms to severe bilateral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and death a rapid replication of the virus within the first 24 hours from the infection and the relatively high about 3 reproduction number were described 4 the available viral genome sequences allowed to soon recognize the close relationship between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 the causative pathogen of the 2002-2004 outbreak presenting with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars both viruses belong to the coronaviridae family they are characterized by a single-stranded 30 kb positive-sense rna and enveloped spherical virions of about 160 nm the unusual large size of their genome leaves these viruses enough space to rearrange their genes recombination thus donating them some genomic plasticity 5 furthermore rna biosynthesis seems to use a virus-specific template switch which results in transcription of sub-genomic mrnas and eventually leading to homologous rna recombination 5 nevertheless by encoding a 3-5exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 nsp14-exon which is required for high-fidelity replication the mutation capacity of sars-cov-2 is debated 6 in the end somehow the plasticity allowed coronaviridae to acquire a rich strains biodiversity and the ability to jump species which already caused previous zoonotic outbreaks as for mers-cov and sars-cov 7 8 9 starting from observed similarities in a short region of rdrp gene between sars-cov-2 and a bat coronavirus batcovratg13 further sequences were identified to be 96 identical at the whole-genome level corroborating the hypothesis of animals to humans spill-over 10 as of june 3 more than 6 million cases of covid-19 have been declared including more than 380 thousands of deaths 11 because of the rapid and fatal spread of the pandemic the research on development of diagnostic tests was set a priority for infection control measures and patients care the present review summarizes performances and limitations of diagnostic tests to help clinicians in the interpretation of the results and clinical management three of the major challenges in molecular diagnosis are 1 to detect small amount of viral rna for reducing the number of false negatives 2 to differentiate the positive signal among different pathogens for decreasing the number of false positives and 3 to have a large capacity in order to quickly and correctly test a large number of patients while avoiding false negatives and false positives molecular and serological tests were previously compared during the sars-cov-1 epidemic showing an increased sensitivity and specificity for the molecular ones for this reason real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr represents the validated assay for early diagnosis in patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection 12 first publications showed that diagnosis was possible by targeting the spike s gene of the virus with a good specificity differentiating sars-cov-2 from sars-cov-1 but limited sensitivity 10 sensitivity was further improved when integrating other viral-specific genes such as rdrphelicase hel nucleocapside n and envelop e genes 13 a comparison between all targeted genes revealed that best results were obtained with rdrphel genes 14 and who guidelines recommend the use of rdrp e n and s genes in different combinations 12 in our institution we introduced the who recommended test described by corman et al targeting the e gene followed by confirmation with rdrp primers 13 on our fully automated molecular diagnostic platform 15 rna extraction was performed through the magna pure 96 system roche basel switzerland and the rrt-pcr was carried out on a quantstudio 7 system applied biosystems waltham united states 15 we observed low sensitivity of the rrt-pcr targeting the rdrp gene due to a mismatch in the primer also described by corman and collegues 13 and since the e gene was constantly more sensitive than rdrp we decided after having performed about 1000 tests to continue addressing the e gene only 16 this allowed us to save reagents and to be able to perform an increasing number of tests in a setting of reagents shortage due to the pandemic nature of covid-19 to detect a possible drift due to mutations and to avoid that a mutant strain escape our diagnostic test we kept targeting both e and rdrp genes once a week rna extraction methods can generally be classified into i one-step with the rt step and the pcr reaction in the same tube and ii two-steps rt-pcr initial creation of dna copies with rt reaction followed by their addiction to the pcr reaction typically one-step pcr uses one reaction-tube minimizing the risk of contamination false positive results on the other hand two-step pcr allows for archiving the cdna sample and further testing of other genes as pointed out in a recent work from pang and colleagues 17 there are different rna extraction platforms summarized in table 1
 which can allow to improve sensitivity and tat but also sometimes increase the costs despite the good performance of the validated naats there is still a risk of false negative results most of them concern the pre-analytic setting such as the timing of the specimen collection too early or too late in the infection course including the limit of detection due to late infections with atypical manifestations the quality of sampling insufficient material or type of specimens bronchoalveolar lavage -bal exhibits the highest sensitivity followed by induced sputum naso-pharyngeal -np swab oro-pharyngeal -op swab and feces and finally the sample transport inappropriate container exposure to extreme temperatures etc 18 19 further reasons decreasing the performance of a molecular test include the ability of the virus to mutate changing sequence of the regions in which primers are hybridizing or the pcr inhibition 20 the latter being nowadays almost insignificant in our laboratory we observed an inhibition in about 03 of the tested samples with the purpose of reducing the tat of naats several rapid microarray and sequencing solutions built on multi-rt-pcr panels and automated systems have been developed 17 21 an important highly performing test although expensive and not useful for a high number of samples is the genxprt sars-cov-2 test cepheid httpswwwcepheidcom which due to its simplicity and its very short tat rapidly helped patient management especially regarding isolation procedures 22 finally several manufacturers already developed other advanced specific systems 23 24 25 26 27 28 and investigations showed their easiness rapidity and compatibility with automation 29 30 one of the down-sides of serological assays is the limited sensitivity at early stage when the host has not yet developed specific antibodies in the specific case of sars-cov-2 data from literature showed a production of igm and igg starting after the first week from infection and generally detectable from the second 31 32 33 34 leaving some space for delayed antibody responses previously associated for mers-cov with more severe disease 35 another conundrum is to avoid the cross-reactivity between antibodies against different viruses part of the same or different families this is particularly difficult since most of the human coronaviruses are antigenically closely related 36 although solvable by adding a virus neutralization test as previously suggested by who during sars epidemic in 2004 37 sensitivity and specificity of serological assays can also be affected by the target antigen as highlighted by meyer and colleagues the s protein produced in more advanced stage of sars-cov-2 infection showed lower levels of sensitivity and more specificity especially the s1 subunit compared to the n protein 38 noteworthy we recently observed a coste et al data not shown that the antibodies directed against the n protein seems to decrease earlier than the s protein thus the sensitivity of assays targeting only the n protein may be impaired according to the timing of infection figure 1
 for this reason we recommend to systematically use two tests one targeting the s protein and one targeting the n protein for diagnostic purposes for sero-epidmiological studies a test targeting the s protein is recommended the added value to target the s protein is that the titers will likely better reflect protection against reinfection in table 2
we summarized the interpretation of diagnostic microbiological tests according to the time of infection the presence or absence of symptoms and the type of diagnostic test used interestingly the high specificity of the s protein was corroborated by a study on sars-cov-2 spike protein epitopes showing that even considering the homologies with sars-cov-1 the virus of covid-19 exhibits novel antibody epitopes 39 this translates in the lack of efficacy of sars-cov-1 antibodies against covid-19 40 but at the same time it reinforces our trust in the specificity of the serological test when targeting s proteins there are currently a huge number of tests on the market 21 ideally only high quality assays with sensitivity greater than 95 and specificity superior or equal to 98 should be used as well as for naats different platforms can be considered also for serological tests the lateral flow assays lfa often exhibits a lower sensitivity then the enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa and chemo-luminescent immune-assays clia 41 among the different lfa we identified the dynamiker tianjin as one of the best being both sensitive and specific coste et al2020 submitted for publication nevertheless we preferred elisa and clia which enable larger series and less hands on time in lausanne we initially started on 14th april using a elisa based assay epitope diagnostics usa that was targeting the n protein this elisa exhibited 96 of sensitivity on samples taken 15 to 30 days post-infection and a specificity of 100 on 450 samples taken before the outbreak coste et al2020 data not shown submitted for publication more recently we moved to clia the snibe run on maglumy instruments china target the n protein alike the roche clia runring on cobas instruments switzerland conversely the abbott test running on the m2000 instruments usa and the diasorin test running on the liaison instruments italy both target the s protein as mentioned median time for seroconversion is of about 10 to 14 days 31 32 33 but early seroconversion has also been documented already 3 to 5 days post-infection 34 interestingly the appearance of igm occurs at the same time than igg thus the main advantage to also test igm is to assess the timing of the infection the need of developing point-of-care devices to reduce the tat and increase the number of daily tests have stimulated the research towards faster and simpler kits numerous manufacturers quickly developed rapid immuno-chromatographic point-of-care tests already available on the market 21 at this point data are being gathered on the diagnostic gain obtained through these rapid kits and further and more accurate studies are warranted which can define sensitivity and specificity of the tests in relation with timing of infection and targeted proteins in a complex scenario such as the ongoing pandemic not only the diagnoses need to be timely and accurate but laboratory testing needs also to provide epidemiological information in order to assess the magnitude of the event and the spread rate in this setting serological assays can become helpful both to complete the epidemiological link when molecular diagnosis results are negative and to alleviate the burden of laboratories implicated in molecular diagnosis 12 in this way a rapid point-of-care serological assay cheap and simple enough to be affordable by any hospital if used correctly not at an early stage of disease could allow enlarging the spectrum of tested population especially among those who did not develop enough symptoms to require hospitalization hence molecular testing at the same time if used as an asset for population screening at the right time and as adjunctive to the reference method the overall epidemiological information gained could account for the sensitivity loss in early stage of diagnosis indications for serological testing are summarized in table 3
 while serological assays can represent a useful epidemiological asset naats remains the gold standard for diagnosis due to their high sensitivity even at early stages of the disease following the quantification of viral load over time and integrating that with information on sample collection technique and timing might be helpful to differentiate different stages of the disease viral quantification will also provide information regarding the value of testing different samples from different parts of the body due to the main respiratory tropism of sars-cov-2 best samples for sensitivity come from the respiratory tract in particular np swabs showed higher and longer persisting viral loads than op swabs 42 in one hand due to the higher concentration of the virus in the lower respiratory tract it could be argued that sensitivity of np swabs is still not enough to avoid false negative results on the other hand samples from lower respiratory tract such as bal or bronchial aspirates require invasive procedures not possible without intubation in subjects already suffering from severe respiratory insufficiency finally the decision whether to trust or not a negative np swab should be always corroborated by the clinical presentation of the patient 43 and if possible completed by serology testing if a strong clinical suspicion is present the repetition of the test is recommended a new np swab is the first option since often the false negative np test is due to inadequate sampling of only the distal part of the nasal cavity repetition of the test with a lower respiratory tract sample will be advisable for those patients admitted to the hospital hence with heavier symptoms but stable enough to be submitted to invasive procedures if the patient is asymptomatic but still considered at risk of infection due to specific exposure investigating the serology between 10 and 15 days after the exposure could help to document an asymptomatic infection samples like blood and urines were found to be weakly-to-none sensitive while the virus was also found in feces and perineal swabs of patients with gastro-intestinal symptoms 44 45 indicating another sample deserving further investigations another consideration is whether the local respiratory gastro-intestinal microbiota play a role against the diffusion of the virus which together with the immune system diversity might contribute to the variety of clinical presentations and affect different viral concentrations 46 47 finally considering this rapidly evolving pandemic and its zoonotic outbreak more knowledge needs to be gathered from further studies in the diagnostic field both investigating the specific features of this virus and novel diagnostic approaches possibly combining the molecular methods with the serologic ones in order to booster sensitivity and specificity results despite the desperate need to implement naat or serological test the introduction of these tests needs to be done with high quality criteria to assess the performance of the tests in order to avoid a massive amount of false positive and false negative results to save time the validation of these tests should be centralized to reference laboratories and then rapidly implemented in other laboratories upon validation of the performance of the test dr caruana dr croxatto dr opota dr coste dr lamoth dr

 during the first week after the onset of symptoms the elisa iga analysis was significantly more sensitive than the clia igm p  0001 although not-statistically significant higher sensitivity was also observed for the elisa igg compared to the clia igg p  045 the sensitivity of the clia iggigm increased one week after symptom onset reaching levels equivalent to those of the elisa iggigm assay from the third week among the negative control samples ten false positive results were observed with elisa iga 138 six of these cross-reacted with serum containing antibodies against ebv n  2 m pneumoniae n  3 anti-pl12 n  1 and four were without any known confounding factor no false positive results were obtained with the clia iggigm test the distribution of the negative data points for both tests fig 1 fig 2

table 3
shows the percentage of agreement between the five immunoassays overall the best agreement was observed between the clia and labon time assays 91 cohen kappa index of 0819 and between the two lateral flow assays labon time and avioq 915  cohen kappa index of 0829 the absence of agreement between the five serological assays observed during the first week following symptom onset lessened 14 days after symptom onset with all assays achieving 97 to 100 agreement serological testing is a complementary test in covid-19 diagnosis and a strategic vehicle in the second phase of the pandemic necessary for epidemiological study and lockdown exit programmes immunoassays could provide identification of non-contagious and potentially protected individuals to support progressive de-confinement strategies in the process of gradually restoring safe economic and social activity 1011 different types of serological tests are available on the market and could be applied to the massive testing challenge the world is currently facing fully automated clia and elisa assays allow the quantitative determination of antibodies against sars-cov-2 by clinical laboratories with increased screening capacity in this study the elisa iggiga was tested on a fully automated microtiter plate analyser the workflow for elisa tests depends on the analyser used in our laboratory the capacity was 90 tests per 3-4 hours in contrast the clia iggigm assays are fully automated random-access tests this technology allows up to 180 tests per hour depending on the platform used with the results delivered in about 40 minutes the performance of maglumi iggigm tests has been successfully evaluated by padoan et al showing the reliability of these immunoassays for assessing the immunological response in the sera of covid-19 patients these tests show that it takes at least 12 days to reach 100 sensitivity for igg and a 88 positive rate for igm 12 in another study that compared the maglumi iggigm and euroimmun iggiga 100 sensitivity was observed with maglumi igg 10 days following onset of symptoms these authors reported a lower sensitivity for the maglumi igm 60 compared to the euroimmun iga 100 13 in the current study the maglumi iggigm tests also showed overall lower sensitivity than the euroimmun iggiga test 643 vs 844 but in contrast their specificity increased to 100 the mean days since symptom onset in the population tested for this study was 1146 days median of 10 days this can explain the lower sensitivity of the maglumi iggigm tests in our study as compared to those in the literature obka et al 8 also described higher sensitivity observed in the euroimmun iga test than in the euroimmun igg test 836 vs 617 this was particularly evident in the two first weeks after symptom onset but with less specificity for the former test 861 vs 986 recently many commercial lateral flow assays have been developed and ce-labelled in this study three of these were also evaluated the results showed that their global sensitivity specificity npv and ppv were equivalent to the elisa iggiga or the clia iggigm tests in addition excellent concordance between the five immunoassays tested in this study was observed 14 days after the onset of symptoms similar results were reported by li et al showing good sensitivity 886 and specificity 906 with a rapid test in a large cohort of patient samples in china they observed similar performances with serum plasma and fingerstick blood 14 rapid serological tests can be performed in the laboratory or used as point-of-care tests poct the latter will provide accurate results within 10 to 15 minutes with equivalent sensitivity and specificity as the quantitative automated immunoassays particularly two weeks after onset of symptoms the opportunity to test outside of the clinical laboratory by lateral flow assay makes it possible to reach larger population groups without saturating the capacity of the laboratories poct may play an important role in large-scale testing in order to evaluate herd immunity against sars-cov-2 however mistakes in the interpretation of results in situations that are not under the control of trained staff must be taken into consideration for this reason the development of automated reader devices could help to reduce errors and increase sensitivity in addition such a device could support the transmission of the results to a public health institution to provide real-time information about seroprevalence at the population level while still awaiting the results of large seroprevalence studies in the community wu et al report a detection rate of around 10 of sars-cov-2 igg in asymptomatic subjects from a single-centre investigation 15 the causal relationship between humoral response and illness severity is still unclear zhao et al revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titres two weeks after illness onset 16 yongchen et al highlight the complementary role of immunoassays to rt-qpcr in the diagnosis of covid-19 particularly in critical patients with a negative rt-qpcr they observed seronegative asymptomatic patients four weeks after positive rt-qpcr results 17 in the current study two asymptomatic patients tested seronegative by all the immunoassays 20 days after a positive rt-qpcr result further studies in asymptomatic patients are necessary to understand better the humoral responses in this population and to understand the role of the real herd immunity in determining lockdown exit strategies this study has some limitations first this is a retrospective study performed with residual samples and the lack of fresh serum could impact the accuracy of the results second no reliable gold standard for serological tests is currently available for comparative studies and little literature exists concerning a comparison of immunoassay methods for sars-cov-2 detection furthermore the criteria for assessing the time of illness onset were recovered from medical records and may contain imprecisions due to subjectivity in the perception of symptoms and timing in conclusion this study shows the accurate and equivalent performance of five serological antibody assays elisa clia and three lateral flow tests in detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of covid19 symptoms making them compatible for application in the clinical context and in developing epidemiological strategies for the covid-19 pandemic the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 2019-ncov iggigm rapid test

new world camelids sanjay kapil teresa yeary james evermann f   the vesicular stomatitis virus vsv agent is classified as a vesiculovirus under family rhabdoviridae and is widely distributed in north and south america15 two serotypes of vsv circulate in the united states new jersey vsvnj and indiana vsvin isolates exhibit a low level of genetic variation and only four distinct genotypes have been detected in the united states and mexico vsv commonly infects horses cattle goats sheep and pigs clinical disease is rare in llamas serologic evidence of vsv infection in alpacas has been reported16 alpaca vsv isolates have been classified as genotype g215 and most infections with vsv are subclinical and go unrecognized viral infection is localized in the epithelial cells of the mouth excess salivation is the most common clinical sign of vsv infection fulminant disease is characterized by formation of vesicles in the mouth tongue nostrils feet and teats the incubation period of vsv is about 28 days death is rare but animals may refuse to eat mild antiseptic mouthwashes may be applied to prevent secondary infections little-to-no immunity develops against vsv and no vaccine is currently available to protect against this disease other differential viral diseases to consider in diagnosis are rabies orf contagious ecthyma and foot-and-mouth disease a serious foreign animal disease because vsv is a reportable disease in the united states if you suspect vsv contact your states usdaaphis area veterinarian-in-charge who will arrange to collect appropriate samples to be sent to the national veterinary services laboratory in ames iowa samples to be submitted include serum for vsv-serum neutralization testing for both serotypes vesicular fluid and epithelium scrapings are also collected for virus isolation and pcr if vsv is detected and confirmed the animals will be placed on quarantine for 30 days after the symptoms disappear this is a seasonal disease with more cases happening in summer and fewer in winter17 epidemiologic maps indicate that viral outbreaks occur in populations located along rivers foot-and-mouth disease fmd is caused by an apthovirus belonging to family picornaviridae it is an rna virus that has seven immunologically distinct serotypes and subtypes18 susceptible species include cattle sheep goats pigs bison and deer new world camelids appear to less susceptible to fmd virus19 foot-and-mouth disease is a major barrier for trade around the world because it can cause serious morbidity and mortality in livestock13 the role of new world camelids in fmd epidemiology is controversial depending on the type of virus contracted individual responses vary based on an experimental study after exposure to fmd strain a24 llamas developed vesicular lesions on their extremities20 in this study animals did not excrete virus in esopharyngeal fluid beyond 8 days13 therefore it is likely that camelids play a minor role in transmission of fmd virus because they do not become carriers of the virus although not performed commonly llama embryo transfer presents a low risk for transmission of fmd21
 papillomaviruses are small nonenveloped dna viruses that infect the skin of animals these viruses replicate exclusively in skin and mucosal surfaces are resistant to disinfectants and stable in the environment camelid mucocutaneous fibropapillomas were reported on the lips nose nares and cheeks in two llamas and three alpacas all 6 years of age22 lesions on the face appeared as hyperkeratotic gray nodular tumors to confirm a diagnosis of papillomavirus fresh skin biopsies can be submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for pan-papillomavirus pcr based on a partial sequence of a conserved sequence of the e1 gene of papillomavirus the camelid papillomavirus has a 73 homology with bovine papillomavirus-1 and 64 homology with canine papillomavirus a rabbit polyclonal antibody is available for diagnosis of most animal papillomaviruses however it has not yet been demonstrated to be useful in diagnosing camelid fibropapilloma cases electron microscopy can also be used to diagnose papillomavirus infections speculation about potential effects of bovine viral diarrhea bvd virus infection in nwc were initially viewed with skepticism about the disease potential of the virus23 because early evidence centered on serologic studies and sporadic reports of bvd viral infections being associated with respiratory disease enteric disease and occasional abortions23 a pestivirus bvd has two biotypes cytopathic and noncytopathic based on production of cytopathic effects in cell culture and is further classified as two major genotypes type i and ii both have been reported in nwc bovine viral diarrhea virus has now been shown to be involved in nwc cases of diarrhea ill thrift reproductive losses respiratory disease and disseminated disease23 24 25 and it is capable of causing multisystem effects in nwc in much the same manner as bvd viral infections in cattle sheep and goats25 the serologic incidence of bvdv in nwc has been reported to be from about 4424 to as high as 5323 one of the major effects of bvd viruses upon nwc is infection of nave animals during pregnancy resulting in abortion or establishing an immunotolerance in the developing fetus via congenital infection the hallmark of the congenital infection is the formation of a cria that is persistently infected pi in much the same way that has been described for bvd virus pis in cattle the literature has been gracious in regards to documenting the occurrence of bvd pi crias and of major importance biosecurity measures to minimize contact of pregnant bvd-nave alpacasllamas with bvd virus-infected herd mates including commingling with cattle sheep and goats23 much of the clinical interpretation and pathogenesis of bvdv in nwc is derived from studies in cattle production of pi in cattle is a characteristic of bvdv recently pi has been reported in alpacas in north america and europe25 26 27 28 29 because the gestation period is much longer in nwc than in cattle the period of susceptibility of the camelid fetus for induction of pi has not been accurately determined bvdv has been isolated from a stillborn alpaca fetus30 however the number of bvdv-induced abortions is still rare in nwc the virus has been isolated from crias that fail to gain body weight27 ocular and nasal infections have also been reported28
 detection of bvdv in nwc is diagnostically challenging31 most bvdv-detection assays used for cattle such as virus isolation serum-neutralization and rtpcr can be used in nwc however the commercial antigen-capture elisa test can give false positive results because nwc serum samples cause high background reactions diagnosis of bvd viral infections in nwc follows strategies similar to cattle including virus isolation from key tissues lymph nodes whole blood fetal tissues and placenta pcr from whole blood and immunohistochemistry ihc on formalin-fixed tissues the availability of bvd virus pi-specific assays for cattle has not yet been validated for nwc these assays use ear notch elutes or serum from suspected animals that are tested for bvd viral antigen by an elisa or antigen-capture elisa ace studies conducted on naturally infected bvd virus pi crias have indicated that the serum may be suitable for testing until further validation studies are conducted screening nwc by bvd viral-specific pcr on whole blood will detect active infectionviraemia either acute transient infection or a pi and serology on serum will detect neutralizing antibody indicating prior infection and probable immunity a recent nationwide survey reflected the extent of bvd viral infection in the united states32 of the 63 herds tested 25 had bvd seropositive crias and 6 had evidence of bvd virus pi crias seropositivity to bvd virus was linked to the feeding of supplemental bovine colostrum containing bvd viral antibodies the study emphasized the need to establish biosecurity measures that prevent transporting female alpacas with crias at side to other farms for breeding if the cria is persistently infected with bvd the probability of bvd virus infection to susceptible nave females in other herds is a high risk experimental inoculation of alpacas vaccinated with a killed bvd viral vaccine resulted in seroconversion by all the animals and protection against a challenge infection with a field strain of alpaca bvd virus type 1b s byers and colleagues personal communication 2008 although licensed vaccines are available for controlling bvd viral infections in cattle none are labeled for use in nwc use of bvdv vaccines for nwc is not recommended because the disease is not a widespread problem in camelids adenoviruses are double-stranded dna viruses that have been associated with a variety of clinical conditions though infection may present only as subclinical disease four cases of adenovirus infections in llamas have been reported33 bronchopneumonia involving a large portion of the lung in a 5-month-old llama was described mucopurulent nasal discharge and lethargy was displayed by the second llama both llamas had fibrinous pleuritis and serosanguinous pleural exudates the third llama had chronic wasting and respiratory alkalosis llamas 3 and 4 both had fibrinous peritonitis and pleuritis histologic examination of liver showed large intranuclear inclusion bodies compatible with adenovirus infection virus was detected by fluorescence antibody testing in the lung parenchyma of all four animals using a porcine adenovirus conjugate rotavirus rv has been documented as a cause of diarrhea in south american camelids34 based on serum antibody prevalence rv is quite common in south american camelids 779835 in one report group a rotavirus was isolated from two newborn guanacos from farms 700 km apart that had previously reported severe outbreaks of diarrheal disease during calving the presence of rv was confirmed by electron microscopy circulating antibodies against rv were not detected in either animal indicating a failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies coronavirus infection was not detected in the two young guanacos from either farm based on bovine coronavirus antigen and serology testing however bacterial infections due to escherichia coli and salmonella were detected both guanacos were captured hand raised and fed with bovine milk based on electrophoresis both farms experienced a distinctive long dsrna electropherotype of rv that differed from each other and also from bovine rv isolates both rotaviruses were genotype g8 however the bovine p types of the rv were p1 and p1435 a subsequent serologic survey conducted on the two farms indicated a high 95 prevalence of antibody titers in the herds36
 coronavirus is the most common viral cause of enteritis in young crias and adult camelids32 37 38 the diarrhea due to coronavirus in camelids can be severe and require intensive therapy in one report alpaca coronavirus was involved in 42 of the cases of diarrhea the virus was detected throughout the year37 alpaca coronavirus is closely related to antigenic group 2 bovine coronavirus39 in a recent case report38 an adult 4-year-old alpaca experienced weight loss nutritional stress and foul smelling watery diarrhea antigenic group 2 coronavirus related to bovine coronavirus was detected by rtpcr and ihc38 diagnosis of coronaviral diarrhea can be achieved by electron microscopy or by pcr techniques it has been speculated that the association of coronaviral diarrhea in alpacas may be an indication of a stress nutritional immunologic and so forth and may be a stress indicator james evermann personal communication 200938 39 there is a preliminary report that acute respiratory syndrome ars a recently described disease also known by the colloquial term snots in the alpaca industry is caused by antigenic group i coronavirus40 the disease is associated with mild-to-severe respiratory presentations and on postmortem examination interstitial pneumonia is observed with lymphocytic infiltrates thus indicating a viral cause kochs postulates have not been fulfilled however based on serology the animals from herds with a reported history of ars have been found to have increased antibody titers to the group i coronavirus40
 herpesviruses are stable double-stranded dna viruses that cause respiratory disease abortions ocular infections and nervous system diseases most herpesviruses are highly host-specific although there are rare reports of transmission of herpesvirus infections to other species after close contact41 the occurrence of disease following infection of nwc by equine herpesvirus-1 ehv-1 was a major turning point in studies of infections capable of causing clinical symptoms in alpacas and llamas before this report41 serologic data had indicated that nwc were susceptible to infection as determined by specific antibodies but apparently resistant to many equine and bovine viruses an outbreak of blindness and encephalitis due to infection with ehv-1 occurred in a group of 100 camelids on an exotic animal farm in new york state one year after their import from chile41 four animals developed neurologic disease unlike ehv-1 infection of horses which causes a systemic infection the pathogenesis of ehv-1 in nwc involved infection of the nasal mucosa followed by spread to the olfactory nerve optic nerve and then cns the blindness in these animals was characterized by dilated unresponsive pupils that were confirmed by fundoscopic examination and there was evidence of vitritis retinal vasculitis retinitis chorioretinitis and optic neuritis in 21 alpacas and one llama all affected animals were seropositive for antibodies to ehv-1 virus isolated from brain and eye tissues was experimentally tested for virulence by intranasal infection of three llamas42 two animals developed severe neurologic disease and one developed mild disease lesions developed in brain and retina after experimental infection and the virus was recovered from thalamus of one animal42 vaccines are available for prevention of ehv-1 in horses only but as a rule they are not to be used off-label to protect nwc unless the animals are in close proximity to horses only killed vaccines should be considered in the nwc until further safetyefficacy studies are conducted with modified live virus vaccines rabies is an important zoonotic disease that is introduced mostly from wildlife to domestic animals and humans43 reports of rabies virus infections in camelids are rare but spread of rabies from alpaca to alpaca can occur12 44
 rabies viral infection in camelids is primarily spread by feral dogs although the red fox skunks and bats have also been reported as transmitters in dromedary camels there are two forms of rabies raging fury and the more rare silent fury incubation ranges from as short as 3 weeks up to 6 months during the final paralytic stage dromedaries will be recumbent and attempt to yawn continuously very characteristic in nwc rabies results in an aggressive form and rarely the paralytic form the major symptoms are self-mutilation and attacks upon humans and penmates it has also been noted that nwc cannot spit due to the paralysis of pharynx diagnosis of rabies must be handled by a veterinarian and is conducted by standard methods on impression smears of fresh brain prevention of rabies can be achieved by barrier vaccination of animals in close proximity to camelids such as dogs and cats killed vaccines have been successfully used in both owc and nwc melanie boileau personal communication 2009 eastern equine encephalitis eee virus is an alphavirus that belongs to the family togaviridae it is transmitted seasonally by mosquitoes to horses and humans who are dead-end hosts for eee there is one retrospective case report with eight alpacas and one llama45 central nervous diseases can be difficult to diagnose in camelids due to their stoic nature but clinical signs may include lethargy twitching of head and neck opisthotonus seizures vestibular signs and ataxia like other viral encephalitides eee induces an increased protein concentration and mononuclear pleocytosis the mortality rate in these cases was close to 90 the virus was localized in the brain tissue the lesions were not detected in the spinal cord the diagnostic tools include virus isolation rtpcr on brain tissues and ihc on brain tissue serology can be used as a supportive tool a killed eee vaccine is under evaluation for camelids46 camelids are also susceptible to western and venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses west nile virus wnv is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is indigenous to africa asia europe and australia it is transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes that have fed on birds that carry the virus since 1999 nwv has spread progressively across the united states so that it is now regarded as an endemic infection camelids are relatively genetically resistant to wnv the attack rate clinical symptoms is low compared with the overall infection rate primary clinical symptoms of wnv infection are ataxia hyperesthesia and recumbency there are three reports of wnv encephalitis in alpacas ranging in age from 3 months to 7 years46 47 48 the clinical signs reported include fever lethargy depression anorexia encephalitis head tremors ataxia stiff gait altered mental status and hyperesthesia treatment with hyperimmune camelid serum with wnv-neutralizing antibodies can provide protection in the early stage of the mnv infection49 a neutralization assay is available for antemortem diagnosis rtpcr can be performed on brain tissues to confirm the pathologic diagnosis as can ihc on selected fixed brain and spinal cord tissues there is one report that a licensed equine wnv vaccine is safe for use in camelids however the efficacy of the vaccine has not been determined49
 bluetongue virus btv is a double-stranded segmented rna virus belonging to the family reoviridae genus orbivirus that has the ability to evolve and spread to new geographic areas due to culicoides vector transmission50 there are 24 serotypes of btv and it has recently emerged in parts of europe there are a few reports of serum antibodies against btv in camelids from south america the susceptibility of camelids may be affected by the virulence of the infecting btv in one experimental infection with bluetongue serotype 10 both inoculated llamas remained clinically normal but became seropositive after 12 weeks51 there is one published report of lethal bluetongue infection in a 5-year-old female alpaca with a cria52 before death the alpaca developed respiratory symptoms with coughing and hiccup-like breathing on postmortem examination the adult alpaca had erosions and ulcers on the tongue palate and buccal mucosa and severe congestion interstitial pneumonia and alveolar edema in the lung mild hypertrophy of type ii pneumocytes was observed by histopathology the cria remained healthy a competitive elisa for detection of bluetongue antibodies has been published51 the main impact of btv seropositivity in camelids may be the effect upon animal trade50
 a few other viral infections have been reported in camelids however evidence for disease due to these viruses is limited a yearling llama that had a 6-month history of weight loss lameness and opportunistic infections tested positive for retrovirus reverse transcriptase in macrophages and lymph node53 consistent with retroviral infection a complete blood count showed neutropenia and lymphopenia and the animal had generalized lymphoid hypoplasia and plasma cell depletion the llama also developed pneumocystis carinii infection of lungs suspected equine arteritis virus eav abortion was reported in a herd of alpacas but the diagnosis was not confirmed54 the virus was detected by rtpcr in fetal tissues collected from a female alpaca that aborted in her last trimester of gestation54 all five animals in the herd had antibodies to eav there is a preliminary report of isolation of bovine herpesvirus in a llama with bronchopneumonia55
pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from the respiratory tract of the llama infectious bovine rhinotracheitis ibr herpesvirus was confirmed by virus isolation yet the animal was negative for ibr antibodies by serum neutralization test this lack of antibody response may have been to due to acute death as our knowledge regarding infectious diseases of camelids has increased it has become apparent that institution of external and internal biosecurity measures must become a standard by both producers and the veterinarians that serve them according to a recent review56 biosecurity can be defined as those efforts designed to prevent the introduction and subsequent spread of a disease in a population of animals these efforts can be further divided into external measures and internal measures table 1
 external measures are those steps that are directed at preventing introduction of new diseases into a group whereas internal measures are aimed at minimizing the spread and subsequent disease in populations where an infection is already established or endemic to be valid the minimum biosecurity plan should address 1 the means of isolating new animals introduced into an existing population of animals 2 the regulation of animal movement and on-the-farm worker and equipment traffic and 3 the practical design and implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures that are specifically directed at reducing the pathogen load within the population of animals although the diagnosis of camelid viral diseases is still relatively new the observation that there is considerable interspecies spread of viruses see fig 1 among camelids and members of the equine and bovine species allows for veterinarians in search of diagnostic capabilities to locate reputable diagnostic laboratories to assist in disease diagnosis and biosecurity surveillance table 2
lists those infectious agents that may be encountered the table is divided into subclinical infections where a biosecurity profile would be of interest in a presalepurchase preshipment for regulatory purposes and prebreeding the profile usually includes serology testing for brucella abortus btv bvdv and johnes disease serology bvdv pi detection and coronaviral shedding electron microscopy or serology these biosecurity profiles may vary from region to region and it is best to contact the laboratory for specifics on proper samples form of shipment and laboratory fees the other section of table 2 lists those diseases that may be suspected and the samples that can be collected either antemortem or postmortem this section of the table is further divided into where the predominant disease symptoms are manifested such as respiratory reproduction neurologic or skin it is best to contact the laboratory before collecting specimens to determine the best samples to collect for maximizing diagnostic resultsdiagnosis of camelid viral diseases is offered at the followingnew york animal health cornell university ithaca new york httpdiaglabvetcornelledu

  31 the crcov prevalence was higher in dogs 6 months of age 5161 than in younger dogs 2600 all the 13 sera that had been tested previously by ccov elisa pratelli et al 2002 resulted negative for crcov antibodies all the sera collected from the dogs infected experimentally with ccov tested negative by the bcov-based elisa before the challenge and remained negative after 21 days post-infection in contrast ccov antibody titres calculated using ccov-specific elisa pratelli et al 2002 underwent a considerable increase data not shown thus the cross-reactivity between ccov and crcov using the bcov-based elisa was definitively ruled out out of 216 sera examined 36 and 42 samples tested positive by hi and elisa respectively only 10 sera resulted positive by both assays whereas concordant negative results were obtained for 148 samples taking elisa as the gold standard hi relative sensitivity and specificity were 2381 and 8506 respectively most hi positive results were obtained from samples having elisa od values 0100 by rt-pcr analysis of the tissue samples crcov rna was detected in the lungs of a 60-day-old german shepherd of the apulia region the dog 24005 had died with signs of severe haemorrhagic gastroenteritis but without any respiratory distress although at necropsy small areas of bronchopneumonia were observed a taqman-based real-time pcr assay decaro et al 2005b carried out on the intestinal content of this dog identified the nucleic acid of canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 which was characterised as cpv-2c by means of an mgb probe assay decaro et al 2005a decaro et al 2006 moreover ccov type ii rna was detected in the intestinal content by means of genotype-specific real-time rt-pcr decaro et al 2005c by testing other tissue samples from the dead dog crcov rna was found also in the spleen mesenteric lymph nodes and intestine but not in the liver kidney and bone marrow all attempts failed to isolate on cell cultures the crcov strain from the rt-pcr positive samples as demonstrated by the if and rt-pcr results obtained from the third passages on hrt-18 cells of all tissue homogenates the specificity of the amplification was confirmed by sequence analysis of the rt-pcr product generated by primer pair sp1sp2 the 595-bp fragment analysed showed the highest nucleotide nt identity 98 to the only crcov strain currently available in the genbank database strain t101 and to the strictly related viruses bcov hcov-oc43 and hecv-4408 97 of nt identity whereas a high divergence was observed from the group i coronavirus ccov type ii 4 of nt identity table 1
 phylogeny with the neighbor-joining method showed that strain 24005 was tightly intermingled with crcov strain t101 forming together a separate cluster within group ii coronaviruses fig 1
 a similar tree topology was obtained using the maximum parsimony data not shown in this study the presence of crcov in italy was clearly demonstrated by using serology and rt-pcr by means of serological testing the prevalence of crcov in italy was found to be similar to those assessed in uk 36 and republic of ireland 30 priestnall et al 2006 rather than those observed in japan 178 kaneshima et al 2006 and north america 547 priestnall et al 2006 the bcov-based elisa test suggested that a group ii coronavirus has been circulating in the italian dog population not before 2005 whereas the first report of crcov identification in uk dates to 3 years ago erles et al 2003 however due to the absence of representativity of the samples examined it should be taken into account that these data are only indicative of the real circulation of the virus the seropositivity increased with the age of the dogs since crcov antibodies were detected at higher frequency in dogs over 6 months of age with respect to younger dogs a hi test for crcov antibodies was also established taking advantage on the presence of the haemagglutininesterase protein in all group ii coronaviruses that is responsible for haemagglutination of mouse erythrocytes however assuming the elisa test as the gold standard the hi test was proven to be poorly specific and sensitive therefore not recommendable as an extensive diagnostic test the poor specificity may be related to aspecific inhibitions of the haemagglutinating activity by substances present in the sera whereas the lack in sensitivity may be a consequence of the high antibody titres probably required to prevent haemagglutination a definitive evidence of the presence of crcov in italy was provided by the molecular identification of a s-gene fragment in the lungs of a cpv-positive dog showing high identity to the analogous nucleotide sequences of the crcov strain detected by erles et al 2003 despite the wide distribution of the virus in the organism as determined by the rt-pcr positive results obtained from several tissues attempts to isolate the virus on hrt-18 cells were unsuccessful this finding could be explained with low amounts of virus present in the tissues or alternatively with virus inactivation during transportation or storage a poor sensitivity of hrt-18 cells could be ruled out as this cell line has proved to be highly permissive for crcov growth erles et al 2006 although the dog was not reported to have respiratory signs at necropsy some lesions were observed in the lungs however the involvement of crcov in the death of the infected dog could not be demonstrated since a co-infection by cpv-2 was detected to date outbreaks of crcov infection have been reported in uk erles et al 2003 japan kaneshima et al 2006 and canada ellis et al 2005 the present study reports the first detection of crcov in a country of the continental europe enduring epidemiological surveillance will help a timely identification of future outbreaks and a more in-depth comprehension of the pathogenic potential of crcov in dogs  major articles infections with viruses and mycoplasma pneumoniae during exacerbations of chronic bronchitis r buscho o d saxtan p shultz s e finch m mufson a  the association of viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis was studied by serologic or isolation techniques in 46 adult men during the five years from 1964 through 1968 serologic evidence of viral or m pneumoniae infection was detected in 25 of 166 episodes of exacerbation and 14 of 138 remission periods p  002 influenza a virus parainfluenza virus type 3 and coronavirus oc43 predominated infections with other viruses were infrequent infection with m pneumoniae was detected serologically in four patients but this organism was never isolated from sputum specimens rhinoviruses were isolated from frozen-stored sputum specimens in 27 of the episodes of exacerbation and from 055 of the remission intervals p not significant these data suggest that although exacerbations of chronic bronchitis may be accompanied by viral and m pneumoniae infections patients with chronic bronchitis also acquire such infections without a worsening of their respiratory status  most of the microorganisms that infect the respiratory tract can be recovered from individuals undergoing exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 1 2  however the role of viral and mycoplasmal infections in exacerbations of chronic bronchitis has not been fully documented moreover the observations regarding infections in chronic bronchitics in a designated patient population during any specified period may not be comparable to those in other populations because of the high prevalence and morbidity of chronic bronchitis among patients of veterans administration hospitals we have conducted surveillance of one of these groups to assess the impact of respiratory tract infections on the natural course of this disease and to investigate further the occurrence and relative importance of viruses and mycoplasmas in exacerbations 3  evidence of viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections obtained mainly by serologic testing and to a lesser extent by isolation of organisms was correlated with the pattern of clinical disease in patients with chronic bronchitis design of study forty-six male adults with chronic bronchitis outpatients at the veterans administration hospital hines ill constituted the study group these patients all fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis defined as a chronic or recurrent increase in the volume of mucoid or mucopurulent bronchial secretions sufficient to cause expectoration during at least three months of each of the two years prior to entry into the study group their clinical and microbiological status was studied longitudinally during the five years from 1964 through 1968 monthly or in alternate months and during periods of exacerbation each patient reported to the outpatient clinic for examination at each visit a symptom questionnaire was completed by the examiner a physical examination was performed pulmonary function tests were done a sputum specimen was collected for isolation of virus and mycoplasma and a serum specimen was obtained for serologic evaluation the questionnaires and definitions of remissions and exacerbations were modeled after the guidelines reported by the medical research council 4  exacerbations were defined as an increase in cough or sputum production since the patients previous visit symptoms of upper airway infection were not included among these criteria an exacerbation was considered satisfactorily tested for viral and m pneumoniae infections when serum pairs were obtained before and after this episode and a sputum specimen was collect-edior mycoplasmal and viral isolation one hundred sixty-six 62 of 270 exacerbations were tested in this manner for comparison 138 intervals when patients did not experience an exacerbation or were otherwise in remission were similarly tested population characteristics all patients were veterans who attended the pulmonary outpatient clinic on a regular basis they visited the clinic for monthly follow-up an average of 103 months per year and made an average of 110 total visits per year persons who were habitual poor attenders were not included in the study population the ages of the 46 patients at the beginning of the study period ranged from 31 to 79 years the distribution of age was as follows 30-39 years two patients 40-49 years 13 50-59 years nine 60-69 years 13 and 70-79 years nine the median age decade was 50-59 years all patients were or had been cigarette smokers the range of pack-years one pack per man per year was five to 125 median 49 years pulmonary function tests on entry into the study disclosed a marked degree of obstructive pulmonary disease the mean values of forced vital capacity fvc  forced expiratory volume fev 1 and the ratio fev 1fvc were 245 liters 131 liters and 52 expressed as a percentage of normal the fev 1 for study patients ranged from 10 to 80 but two-thirds of the group had values of 40 similarly the fev 1fvc ratio ranged from 30 to 80 of normal and two-thirds of the group had values of50 procedures for isolation of virus sputum specimens for viral isolation were stored at -70 c for five to eight

recovery of picornaviruses adenoviruses herpesviruses and coronavirus strain 229e because of the long period of storage of the sputum specimens no attempt was made to isolate myxoviruses wi-38 roller-tube cultures were obtained from flow laboratories rockville md maintenance medium for these cell cultures consisted of eagles minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 inactivated fetal calf serum the complete medium was adjusted to ph 70 with 7sco nahc0 3 s  cultures were incubated on a rotating drum at 33 c for at least 21 days and often for as long as 28 days subpassages of negative cultures were not made cell cultures were examined three times a week for cpe and the maintenance medium was changed at these times viral isolates vere identified by procedures previously

thallium acetate 005 was used for the isolation of all mycoplasmas duplicate plates were inoculated with sputum one plate was incubated aerobically and the other anerobically at 37 c for four weeks mycoplasma isolates were identified by growth inhibition procedures using specific hyperirnmune antiserum 6  included in the test were antisera to m pneumoniae mycoplasma orale mycoplasma hominis mycoplasma errnentans mycoplasma arthriditis and mycoplasma salioarium approximately one-half of the cultures were passaged on agar a second time from an area selected adjacent to the zone of inhibition in an attempt to identify mixed cultures of mycoplasmas none were detected serologic procedures serial serum specimens were tested by cf for antibodies to influenza a and b viruses respiratory syncytial virus rsv parainfluenza virus types 1 2 and 3 adenoviruses and coronavirus types 229e and oc43 and for m pneumoniae microtiter cf tests containing 17-18 units of complement were employed after fixation overnight at 4 c four units of each viral and mycoplasmal antigen were used serologic evidence of infection was defined as a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between the acuteand convalescent-phase sera occurrence of acute respiratory illness in patients with chronic bronchitis the total number of exacerbations experienced by each patient during their participation in this study ranged from one to 14 mean 59 the number of exacerbations of anyone patient usually was directly proportional to the number of years of participation in the surveillance program the mean number of years of patient participation was 37 only one patient reported no exacerbations during the four-year period of the study exacerbations of chronic bronchi tis tended to occur more often in the winter months than in the summer months although they occurred frequently in all months of the year table 1  serologic evidence -of viral and m pneumoniae infections infections with respiratory virus or m pneumoniae were detected at least once in 40 of the 46 patients studied the mean num-379 ber of infections was 19 range 1-6 although patients included in the study for a longer time experienced somewhat more virus and m pneumoniae infections the relationship was not linear a finding suggesting that individual differences in rates of infection could not be attributed exclusively to the duration of participation in the study fourfold or greater rises in titer of antibody to virus or m pneumoniae were detected in 50 301 of 166 exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in the 46 adult patients studied table 2  by comparison viral and m pneumoniae infections were detected in 38 275 of 138 remissions these rates were not significantly different and suggest that patients with chronic bronchitis can undergo infections with these agents apparently without an acute worsening of their respiratory status when rises in titers of antibody to multiple agents which occurred simultaneously during a single episode were excluded from this analysis the distribution of single-agent infections could be assessed table 3  infections defined as a rise in titer of antibody to a single agent a virus or m pneumoniae were detected in 41 247 of 166 exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and only 19 138 of 138 remissions a difference which was significant p  002 the frequency of individual viral and m pneumoniae infections was analyzed using only these single-agent antibody titer rises table 4  fortyone 82 of 50 rises in antibody titer during exacerbation were single-agent antibody titer rises and during remission 19 50 of the 38 rises were single-agent antibody titer rises the higher incidence of multiple-agent antibody titer rises in remission intervals may be a reflection of the study design more attention was paid to specimen collection during exacerbations with the result that the average intervals defined by available serum pairs were 15 months for exacerbation and 32 months for remission myxovirus and coronavirus infections predominated table 4  influenza a virus parainfluenza virus type 3 and coronavirus oc43 accounted for nearly two-thirds of all infections in each instance these infections occurred more often in exacerbation than in remission a finding that suggests their association with the occurrence of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis however the difference was significant only for influenza a virus and coronavirus oc43 p  005 all other viral infections occurred as often in exacerbation as in remission m pneumoniae infection alone occurred in 24o of exacerbations but not in any remission fifteen additional rises in titer of antibody to m pneumoniae occurred simultaneously with respiratory virus infections these rises were equally distributed between periods of exacerbation and remission viral infections among patients with chronic bronchitis occurred as defined outbreaks  figure  1  in this study viral and m pneumoniae infections were common in patients during exacerbation but such infections occurred also in these patients without worsening of their respiratory status we reported our findings in two ways as rises in titer of antibody to a single agent and as rises in titer of antibody to two or more agents within the same interval rises in titers of antibody to multiple agents predominated in remission intervals which tended to be longer than exacerbation intervals this difference may have accounted for some variation in the antibody titer which was not indicative of specific viral infection antibody titer rises to multiple agents also may reflect heterotypic responses and overestimate the number of infections by analyzing antibody titer rises to single agents in this report we estimated the importance of infection with each specific virus but the approach precluded assessment of the role of dual infection with two viruses or a virus and m pneumoniae in exacerbations rises in titer of antibody to m pneumoniae however were detected most often in association with a titer rise to one or more respiratory viruses the possibility that m pneumoniae can function as a secondary or synergistic pathogen in respiratory tract infections cannot be excluded and requires further investigation that viruses may playa role in exacerbations of chronic bronchitis is suggested by the finding that one-fourth of exacerbations were associated with viral infections this rate was twice that of viral infection in remission infections with influenza a virus and coronavirus oc43 occurred significantly more often in exacerbations than in remissions coronaviruses have been recognized recently as etiologic agents of respiratory illness in children and adults 8 9 10  gump and coworkers also reported association of these agents with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 11  they found that four of seven infections with coronavirus oc43 and two of seven infections with coronavirus 229e were associated with an exacerbation evidence of this relationship has accumulated very slowly because of the requirement for recovery of strain oc43 in human fetal trachea organ cul-tures a difficult procedure infection with coronavirus 229e was not detected either by isola tion or rise in antibody titer in the patients in our study the finding in this study of rhinovirus infections in only 27 of exacerbations is considerably lower than the 23 recovery rate for rhinoviruses in exacerbations reported by eadie 14 15  carilli et al however failed to isolate these agents 16  in his controlled study stenhouse found that rhinovirus infection was not more common in subjects with bronchitis than in the control population but that rhinovirus infection was more likely to be associated with the development of acute lower respiratory tract symptoms 14j the extended period of frozen storage of specimens before tissue culture inoculation may have contributed to our low recovery rate of rhinoviruses sommerville first detected rsv infection in 50 of 82 exacerbations 17j carilli et al 16j and mcnamara et al 13j also found rsv associated with a significant number of exacerbations 17 and 12 respectively unlike these investigators we detected rsv infection by serologic procedures in only one remission interval of only one of our patients the paucity of m pneumoniae infections detected in exacerbations in this study agrees with the results of another recent report 18  in a number of prospective studies m pneumoniae infections have been associated with 87 and 95 of exacerbations 12 13j and with no exacerbations 19  one consistent finding however has been the failure to recover the organism from sputum even from patients with rising antibody titers these results question the significance of serologic responses alone only in this infection and should be further investigated m saliuarium seems ubiquitous in samples of expectorated sputum as well as in specimens obtained during bronchoscopy 2oj  our findings are similar to those reported in a number of other studies on viral and m pneumoniae infections in exacerbations of chronic bronchitis table 5  in various studies the rates of infection in exacerbations ranged widely 4-64 these data have been interpreted as constituting strong but not conclusive evidence for an etiologic role of viruses or m pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis however the available data cannot be easily compared because different sam-piing procedures and methods were employed in addition individual authors often did not specify the number of remission intervals examined but reported only infections detected during exacerbations and compared patients with chronic bronchitis with healthy control populations furthermore the definition of an exacerbation is a subjective judgment and different interpretations of the criteria will affect the percentage of association with infection two groups of investigators have derived a more striking correlation of infection with exacerbation by interpreting their findings in a timeweighted fashion thus gump et al found that the incidence of infection was 32 per patient week of exacerbation but only 09 per patient week spent in remission 11j similarly lamy et al compared patient months spent in exacerbation and remission with an incidence of infection of 52 and 37 respectively 24  our data did not permit a time-weighted analysis since the duration of exacerbation was not recorded when the duration of exacerbation was estimated using the interval between the collection of two samples of serum bracketing an exacerbation we tested 257 months of exacerbation and 442 months of remission the rate of viral infection was 154 per exacerbation month and 43 per remission month this trend is similar to that in the data of gump et al 11  a special problem in interpretation is posed by the detection of infection in patients with chronic bronchitis without an associated acute compromise in their respiratory status in our study approximately one-third of all viral and m pneumoniae infections detected belonged in this category whether subclinical infections contribute to continuing clinical deterioration remains unexplored and long-term epidemiologic and clinical surveillance of patients with chronic bronchitis will be required to answer this

infection 439 of these fatal since its discovery in 20121 apart from its geographical focus in countries in and around the arabian peninsula and laboratory evidence of widespread infection of dromedary camels little is known about the actual epidemiology of the disease in human beings1 2 3 4 5 few primary infections were acquired through direct camel exposure but the relevance of this infection pattern is unclear in the absence of systematic determinations of the proportion of infections in individuals who have had contact with camels5 6 7 moreover most reported patients with primary mers-cov infection have no history of camel exposure suggesting the existence of other as-yet-unknown sources of infection camel milk as a food-borne source seems unlikely8
 for secondary infections acquired through human-to-human contact mathematical projections predicted that transmission chains in the population cannot be sustained9 10 11 the apparent transmission rate in household settings is low with fewer than 50 of index patients transmitting the infection to contacts who subsequently had no pronounced clinical symptoms12 however a highly fatal outbreak of mers-cov infection centred in jeddah saudi arabia in marchapril 2014 was apparently caused by human-to-human transmission in several nosocomial settings without any evidence that the causative virus differed from other mers-cov strains in people in terms of replication in cell culture immune escape or excretion level13 undiscovered mers-cov infections might thus exist in the human population serology is key to the understanding of infection statistics at a population level however only a few serological studies of mers-cov have been done14 15 although none of those preliminary studies showed any evidence of previous infection with mers-cov in the population of saudi arabia the examined cohorts have been small and methods applied in those studies have not been validated for sensitivity and specificity we previously presented the first validated recombinant elisa relisa for mers-cov and combined this test with recombinant immunofluorescence assay rifa and a plaque reduction virus neutralisation test prnt into a staged strategy for mers-cov serology that was shown to identify even subclinical infections on detection of specific antibodies12 here we apply the established testing algorithm on a nationwide serum collection additional serum samples were obtained from individuals occupationally exposed to dromedary camels for the cross-sectional serosurvey we used existing sample collections organised by the ministry of health of saudi arabia individual serum samples were obtained from healthy people older than 15 years selected to represent all ages excluding children and adolescents 15 years in the saudi arabian population samples were obtained with written informed consent given to the ministry of health from participants in households randomly selected in a population-based cross-sectional sampling frame maintained and updated by the national census bureau16 participants lived and gave samples in all 13 provinces of saudi arabia sampling was done through primary health-care centres and hospitals under the supervision of the ministry of health we obtained two collections of serum samples from local primary health-care clinics for individuals selected to participate in a survey of the national burden of disease16 17 and a second collection of samples from individuals selected for a national study of the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus additionally we obtained serum samples from camel shepherds who participated in an ad hoc mers-cov surveillance study implemented by the ministry of health and expatriate slaughterhouse workers in makkah the shepherds gave verbal consent and the slaughterhouse workers gave direct written consent in the frame of the ad hoc surveillance study all serum samples were anonymised before the study and were tested for mers-cov antibodies without further institutional review because the testing of all samples was done as part of a public health intervention by the saudi ministry of health we applied an anti-mers-cov elisa igg euroimmun ag lbeck germany with minor modifications the relisa was based on the soluble mers-cov spike protein subdomain s118 this highly sensitive assay has been validated for use with human serum samples12 samples were applied at a 1100 dilution the cutoff optical density ratio was set to 03 which is three times the ratio of the mean value of all tested human serum samples without known exposure to camels we used rifa to substantiate relisa results because rifa has been shown to be more specific than relisa12 rifa was done with the full mers-cov spike open-reading frame expressed in verob4 cells12 19 for igg detection serum samples were tested at a 140 dilution for igm detection samples were analysed at 120 and 1100 dilutions we did plaque reduction neutralisation tests prnt as previously described20 the first applied dilution of a two-fold dilution series was 110 in accordance with our previous study12 we defined a 120 dilution as the lowest possible diagnostically significant titre20 we recorded serum dilutions conferring 50 and 90 plaque reduction as prnt50 and prnt90 titres respectively we defined stage 1 seropositivity as reactivity in both relisa dilution 1100 and rifa dilution 140 we defined stage 2 seropositivity as stage 1 seropositivity plus reactivity in prnt with a reciprocal titre of at least 20 on prnt50 we regarded stage 2 seropositive results as serological confirmation of past mers-cov infection to compare the age distribution of patients with serologically confirmed cases with that of patients with clinically apparent cases we examined data from international case-notification statistics21 and index-case data from a study of household contact clusters12
 we did a two-tailed mann whitney u exact test with spss software version 21 we did 2 tests and fishers exact tests and calculated cis with openepi open source epidemiologic statistics for public health we applied 2 tests in the seroprevalence calculations of the general population versus camel-exposed individuals and for comparisons of agegroups we used fishers exact tests for calculations of geographical and gender comparisons we applied the non-parametric mann whitney u test to compare the mean ages of patients with mers in different studies the funders of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication between april 1 and june 30 2013 we obtained 5765 serum samples from local primary health-care clinics for individuals selected to participate in a survey of the national burden of disease16 17 and a further 4244 samples between dec 1 2012 and dec 1 2013 from primary health-care centres data for patient demographic characteristics appendix were available for 8719 87 of 10 009 stored serum samples additionally we obtained serum samples from 87 camel shepherds who participated in a mers-cov surveillance study from feb 1 to may 31 2014 and 140 expatriate slaughterhouse workers in makkah during august 2013 the camel shepherds were aged 2184 years mean 379 years sd 1302 and resided in six different provinces al-jouf asir eastern madinah makkah and riyadh the slaughterhouse workers were aged 1562 years mean 3713 sd 864 the mean sample size per province was 770 range 321 to 2343 sd 585 representing between 197 and 971 samples per 100 000 individuals per province mean 529 sd 267 the age distribution of samples with available age information matched that of the population of saudi arabia figure 1
 of the 8719 individuals with available demographic information 4341 50 were male all serum samples from the general population were first screened for mers-cov-specific igg by relisa yielding reactive results in 152 152 95 ci 129178 of 10 009 samples subsequent testing by rifa and prnt50 confirmed less than 02 to be stage 1 and stage 2 seropositive table 1
 appendix because repeat samples were missing the timepoint of seroconversion was established by igm detection coronavirus igm had been previously shown to be maintained for a maximum of 180 days after infection22 only one of 15 seropositive individuals had a reciprocal mers-cov igm titre of at least 100 suggesting recent seroconversion appendix in accordance with our previous study12 seropositivity with relisa was ten times higher than with rifa seroprevalence did not differ between the two subcohorts seven 016 of 4244 patients in the primary health-care study group vs eight 014 of 5765 in the burden of disease study cohort group p094 appendix men had a higher proportion of infections 11 025 of 4341 than did women two 005 of 4378 p0025 cases were identified in four of six age groups without significant age preference appendix confirmed cases of mers-cov infection were identified in six of the 13 administrative provinces of saudi arabia with higher numbers in central provinces that generally are more rural figure 2
 the 13 provinces were classified into seven central and six coastal provinces on the basis of whether they had a shoreline significantly more confirmed infections were in central provinces 14 026 of 5479 samples than in coastal provinces one 002 of 4529 p0003 the proportion of both camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers who were seropositive was significantly higher than in the general population table 1 seropositive individuals were identified in five of six age groups with even distribution appendix both registered patients ie patients with confirmed mers21 and index patients from the household study were significantly older than the serologically confirmed individuals in our present study table 2
 detailed laboratory results in the appendix in our study we identified antibodies against mers-cov in 015 of samples from the general saudi arabian population the true number of infections is difficult to estimate because our sample consisted of only 10 009 003 of the whole population of 29 994 300 people however by combining two cross-sectional subcohorts we could cover all 13 provinces and achieved an age distribution of our sample that largely matched that of the general population panel
 all geographical regions of the country were sampled with a reasonably low variation in the proportions of population that were studied per province to have optimum sample coverage per province we included samples from an earlier study unpublished report for which detailed information about sex and age was not available for 26 of samples nevertheless samples from both subcohorts should be similar in age and sex composition because both were previously obtained according to calculations by the national census bureau to represent the composition of the saudi arabian population this similarity was lent support by the highly similar seroprevalence when we analysed both subcohorts separately even if we had only used data from the more thoroughly documented burden-of-disease study subcohort for which we had sex and age information for 97 of the samples the overall seroprevalence would have been maintained 015 in the overall sample vs 014 in the subcohortpanelresearch in context
systemic review
we searched pubmed with the terms human coronavirus emc or mers-cov and identified 463 english-language reports published before jan 20 2015 two previous studies14 15 reported an absence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov antibodies in a few cohorts of serum samples obtained in saudi arabia from 2010 to 2012 one study investigated 266 individuals from the eastern province14 this study included 158 serum samples taken from children admitted to hospital for infections of the lower respiratory tract from may 2010 to may 2011 and 110 plasma samples from male blood donors taken during december 2012 the other study15 assessed samples taken from 130 male blood donors from jeddah during 2012 and 226 slaughterhouse workers in jeddah and makkah in october 2012 no nationwide cross-sectional antibody surveys have been reported in any of the countries in the middle east known to be affected by mers-cov including saudi arabia jordan united arabic emirates oman qatar kuwait and yemen
interpretation
we did the first nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey for mers-cov antibodies in the population of saudi arabia to explore the putative presence of unrecorded mers-cov infections we noted that 015 of mainly male individuals in six of 13 had specific anti-mers-cov antibodies additionally we identified a seroprevalence of mers-cov that was 1523 times higher in camel-exposed individuals such as shepherds and slaughterhouse workers than in the general population none of the individuals who tested positive for mers-cov antibodies had severe illness before or at the time of sampling the mean age of all identified seroconverted individuals was significantly lower than that of patients with mers admitted to hospital in summary our data suggest that middle-aged men with regular camel contact could sporadically introduce mers-cov into the general population these subclinically infected individuals might represent the unknown source of infection for the many reported patients with mers with no anamnestic camel exposure to obtain an estimate of the total number of seropositive individuals in saudi arabia we did a straightforward extrapolation based on the proportion of stage-2-positive serum samples in both population subcohorts excluding shepherd and slaughterhouse worker samples extrapolation by simple multiplication suggests that 44 951 seropositive individuals 95 ci 26 97171 922 could exist in a total population of 29 994 300 our serological assays might have missed some infections because the high specificity of rifa and prnt could encompass a reduction in sensitivity of the overall serological algorithm however even a projection based on relisa results only would raise the estimated infection rate by about ten times which is several orders of magnitude lower than figures expected for a respiratory disease that continuously transmits between human beings in accordance with our previous study12 seropositivity with relisa was ten times higher than that with rifa12 this rise can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of relisa and by putative crossreactivity of low-affinity igg which is raised in individuals with recent infections from the common-cold coronavirus23
 despite low detection rates antibodies were identified widely across saudi arabia including in provinces where outbreaks in people have not been reported widespread acquisition of infections without subsequent causation of outbreaks corresponds to the concept of a predominantly zoonotic disease that does not readily spread between human beings the raised prevalence in rural regions and the significantly increased proportion of infection in groups that are occupationally exposed to camels emphasises the importance of zoonotic acquisitions by dromedary camels5 6 7 however even though the analysed shepherd samples were collected in six different regions during the first months of 2014 the sampling was not randomised and samples were not strictly taken at the same time as those from the general population similar limitations apply for the slaughterhouse worker samples direct comparison of seroprevalences between these groups and the general population cohort might thus be biased matched case-control studies could be used to substantiate the raised seroprevalence in exposed groups direct animal contact has been reported for only a few primary cases in saudi arabia and elsewhere the younger age of serologically confirmed patients in our study compared with people with laboratory confirmed infection underlines the possibility that mers-cov might cause unrecognised infections that cause no or mild symptoms in healthy younger aged 1544 years and socially active populations these subclinical infections could act as an unknown source for index patients who cannot recall contact with camels importantly the predominance of men even within serologically confirmed cases emphasises a potential association with animal exposure because typically more men than women in saudi arabia associate with camels during leisure activities cases of mers in younger people aged 45 years might seem mild or even subclinical similar to cases in our study of household contact clusters12 in which contacts were younger than index patients and mostly asymptomatic mers might constitute a zoonotic disease that causes enough short-transmission chains in the young male population of saudi arabia for which older and predisposed individuals constitute a sentinel population

hongying li emma mendelsohn chen zong wei zhang emily hagan ning wang shiyue li hong yan huimin huang guangjian zhu noam ross aleksei chmura philip terry mark fielder maureen miller zhengli shi peter daszak  human interaction with animals has been implicated as a primary risk factor for several high impact zoonoses including many bat-origin viral diseases however the animal-to-human spillover events that lead to emerging diseases are rarely observed or clinically examined and the link between specific interactions and spillover risk is poorly understood to investigate this phenomenon we conducted biological-behavioral surveillance among rural residents in yunnan guangxi and guangdong districts of southern china where we have identified a number of sars-related coronaviruses in bats serum samples were tested for four bat-borne coronaviruses using newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa survey data were used to characterize associations between human-animal contact and bat coronavirus spillover risk a total of 1596 residents were enrolled in the study from 2015 to 2017 nine participants 06 tested positive for bat coronaviruses 265 17 participants reported severe acute respiratory infections sari andor influenza-like illness ili symptoms in the past year which were associated with poultry carnivore rodentshrew or bat contact with variability by family income and district of residence this study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover in rural communities in southern china the low seroprevalence observed in this study suggests that bat coronavirus spillover is a rare event nonetheless this study highlights associations between human-animal interaction and zoonotic spillover risk these findings can be used to support targeted biological behavioral surveillance in high-risk geographic areas in order to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence  in the highly biodiverse southern region of china interactions among humans wildlife and livestock are likely to be common and are hypothesized to be a risk factor in the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases 1 2 3  human-animal interactions may pose a particular public health threat in rural communities where frequent contact with animals occurs and where disease prevention measures are likely less well-developed 4  although human-animal interactions are thought to be associated with zoo-notic disease emergence few studies have addressed the nature of specific interactions that occur between animals particularly wild animals and humans that lead to pathogen spillover bats order chiroptera are reservoirs of a large number of zoonotic viruses including coronaviruses covs that have caused disease outbreaks in human and livestock populations 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the causative agent of the sars outbreak affecting 32 countries in 2002-3 infecting 8096 people and causing 774 deaths 14  middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which has caused 823 deaths from 2374 human cases in 27 countries by the end of february 2019 and is thought to have originally spilled over from bats into camels in which is it now endemic 15 16 17 18  and severe acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov which emerged in the pig population of southern china and caused the deaths of more than 20000 piglets in 2017 and 2018 5  a large diversity of coronaviruses including sars-related coronaviruses sarsr-covs has been discovered in bats and phylogenetic and pathogenesis studies of these suggest a high capacity for transmission across species barriers 9 11 13 18 19 20 21 22  however few studies have analyzed bat-to-human spillover events in non-outbreak conditions likely due to the rarity of these events and difficulties in identifying at-risk populations or target geographies additionally the symptoms of novel bat coronavirus infection in the human population may not be clinically recognized at the time of emergence as a result of a lack of adequate surveillance or confusion with other diseases this represents a significant biosafety risk considering the large and increasing number of coronaviruses discovered in bats 23 24 and the wide distribution of bat populations in rural regions such as southern china 25  in this paper we report on a study designed to characterize the bat coronavirus spillover potential associated with presumed high-risk human behavior in rural communities of southern china 26  we collected data during a community serological and behavioral survey to understand the driving factors of bat coronavirus spillover providing evidence for developing community-based strategies in preventing zoonotic disease emergence we conducted a cross-sectional study in the districts of yunnan guangxi and guangdong china which are known for their high levels of wildlife biodiversity active wildlife trade activity and historic zoonotic disease emergence events 3 5 10 14 22 24 27  eight study sites were selected in areas where we have previously reported diverse coronaviruses in bat populations 24 roosting close within 5 km to human dwellings the study targeted human populations that are highly exposed to bats and other wildlife including people who visit or work around bat caves work in local live animal markets raise animals or are involved in wildlife trade eg wild animal harvest trade transportation and preparation as identified by previous exploratory ethnographic interviews prior to the recruitment and sampling project staff who received human subject research training visited each participating site to introduce the project to the local community assisted by officials from provincial and city-level centers for disease control and prevention to generate interest and develop recruitment strategies project staff held meetings with village committees to discuss topics relevant to their daily contact with animals and any health issues in the community that were particularly concerning for them with permissions from local authorities community leaders conducted house visits and broadcast announcements a week before data collection took place to inform community residents about the study and its recruitment plan all information was communicated in local dialects using easily understandable language to convey the study purpose eligibility and inclusion guidelines potential risks and benefits of participation and the time and locations at which the study would take place we aimed to obtain a minimum sample size of 400 participants from each of the three districts yunnan guangxi and guangdong for a total sample size of over 1200 participants a snowball sampling method was used because the population size at selected sites and the people who were highly exposed to wild animals were difficult to elucidate 28  during each house visit we requested information about potential eligible participants from the residents networks and we then followed their referrals to recruit from the community only one person per household was recruited to participate in this study and no participants were recruited from clinics or healthcare settings we made every effort to include participants across a range of demographic indices including gender age and socioeconomic status as well as to ensure that any contribution was voluntary and involved minimal risk to the participants following the completion of the informed consent process a standardized mandarin questionnaire was administered by study staff speaking in local dialects the interview was conducted in a private environment where confidentiality was maintained and interviewers and participants were paired by sex children aged 10 to 18 years were interviewed with the permission and in the presence of a parent or guardian the questionnaire included five sections consisting of demographics living circumstances and livelihood travel types of contact with animals and unusual illness symptoms in the past 12 months the survey assessed symptoms including fever with cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing severe acute respiratory infection sari symptoms and fever with muscle aches cough or sore throat influenza-like illness ili symptoms appendices sari and ili symptoms were included in the survey in anticipation of potentially low coronavirus sero-positivity rates these symptoms are commonly used as metrics in emerging infectious respiratory disease surveillance and are known to be associated with coronavirus infections eg mers-cov sars-cov 29  therefore sari and ili symptom histories can be analyzed in addition to serological testing to maximize our understanding of bat coronavirus spillover risk after the questionnaire interview participants were asked to provide a blood sample 25-5 ml stored in a serum-separating tube and an oropharyngeal swab stored in a cryotube with viral transport medium samples were collected by study staff from local clinics all samples were stored in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and transferred to an ultralow -80c freezer within 48 h what are the behavioral risks in human-animal interactions that could lead to the emergence of bat coronaviruses in human population evidence before this study bat borne coronaviruses have caused several emerging infectious disease outbreaks of global significance including sars novel sars-related coronaviruses have been discovered in bat populations in southern china some of which have the capacity to infect human cells human-animal interactions are thought to be critical for the emergence of bat coronaviruses however the specific interactions linked to animal-to-human spillover remain unknown this study found serological evidence for bat-borne coronavirus transmission to people direct contact with bats was not identified as a risk factor however self-reported severe acute respiratory infection sari andor influenza-like illness ili was linked to human interaction with other wildlife and livestock suggesting that there may be other zoonotic exposures leading to clinical illness in these populations significance of the study findings from this study suggested that an integrated biological and behavioral surveillance in healthy community settings can help identify potential zoonotic disease spillover events or target surveillance to at-risk populations this approach represents a potential early-warning system that could be used under nonoutbreak conditions to identify potential zoonotic emerging diseases prior to largescale outbreaks a unique alphanumeric identification code was assigned to each questionnaire and biological specimen collected from each participant no personal identifying information was collected only authorized study personnel who received human subject research training were allowed access to the questionnaire and biological data serum samples collected from study participants were analyzed using newly developed igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa based on selected nucleocapsid proteins np expressed and purified in e coli for four specific coronaviruses sarsr-cov dq071615 bat sars coronavirus rp3 np hku10-cov sample 3740 np hku9-cov mg762674 batcovhku9-2202 np and mers-cov jx869059 human betacoronavirus 2c emc2012 np micro-titer plates were coated with recombinant and purified np 100ngwell samples were tested at 120 dilution and an anti-human igg-hrp conjugated monoclonal antibody kyab biotech co ltd wuhan china was used as the secondary antibody with different dilution ratios for different coronaviruses 100 serum samples collected from healthy people in wuhan were tested using this elisa kit to set up the cutoff value and positive test results were determined by the cut-off value in each run for each of the four coronaviruses as the product of the mean of all serum samples optical density od values plus three standard deviations and confirmed by western blot test 30  questionnaire data were entered into an excel database with quality control for data cleaning and validation the glmnet package in r version 360 was used to fit a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression to characterize associations between animal contact and sari andor ili symptoms in the preceding 12 months 31 32  the bat coronavirus serology testing outcome was not analyzed in the lasso due to low rates of sero-positivity the lasso regression is an adaptation of the generalized linear model glm and was selected because it is effective at minimizing prediction error for datasets with many predictor variables the model identifies subsets of predictors that are associated with the outcome of interest by applying a shrinkage operation to regression coefficients and shrinking some coefficients to exactly 0 the lasso is often utilized for its variable selection capabilities for sparse datasets including surveys and questionnaires demographic variables age gender province and income were included in the model as independent and interaction terms in order to account for potential confounding because the lasso does not generate confidence intervals we repeated the model using bootstrapping instead to calculate bootstrap support ie the proportion of times a predictor variable is selected in the model 33 34 35 36  chi-square and fisher exact tests were also conducted to explore associations between potential risk factors in local demographics behaviors attitudes independent variables and bat cov serological evidence dependent variables with effect size examined however due to the low positivity rate 91497 the results were not robust and are not reported in this paper from october 2015 to july 2017 a total of 1596 residents from eight sites in yunnan n761 guangxi n412 and guangdong n423 provinces were enrolled in this study of these 1585 participants completed the questionnaires and 11 participants withdrew from the questionnaire interview due to scheduling reasons after the interviews 1497 participants provided biological samples for lab analysis more female 62 than male 38 community members participated in this study most participants were adults over 45 years old 69 and had been living in the community for more than 5 years 97 with their family members 95 a majority 86 relied on a comparatively low family annual per capita income less than 10000 rmb which is below the national mean for per capita disposable income of rural households from 2015 to 2017 11422 -13432 rmb 37  most participants 98 had not received a college education and were making a living in crop production 76 9 of participants frequently traveled outside the county as migrant laborers some participants were working in sectors where frequent human-animal contact occurs such as the animal production business 17 wild animal trade 05 slaughterhouses or abattoirs 05 protected nature reserve rangers 04 or in wildlife restaurants 03 it was common for participants to have multiple part-time jobs as income sources table 1  serological testing of serum samples from 1497 local residents revealed that 9 individuals 06 in four study sites were positive for bat coronaviruses indicating exposure at some point in their life to bat-borne sarsr-covs n7 yunnan hku10-cov n2 guangxi or other coronaviruses that are phylogenetically closely related to these all individuals who tested positive male6 female3 were over 45 years old and most n8 were making a living from crop production none of those participants reported any symptoms in the 12 months preceding the interview due to the low rate of sero-positivity we did not obtain robust results from the statistical comparisons of animal-contact behavior by coronavirus outcome figure 1 shows animal contact rates in the previous 12 months among the survey population n 1585 and among seropositive individuals n9 participants reported common contact with poultry and rodentsshrews and most animal contact occurred in domestic settings through animal raising or food preparation activities among the 1585 participants who responded 265 17 reported experiencing sari n  73 andor ili n  227 symptoms in the last year the lasso regression showed that eating raw or undercooked carnivores in the preceding 12 months was the most salient predictor of selfreported sari andor ili symptoms over the same time period odds ratio or  16 bootstrap support  067 additional salient predictors were slaughtering poultry as a resident of guangxi province or  14 support  068 having an income below 10000 rmb as a resident of guangxi province or  13 support  084 domestic contact with bats or  13 support  063 and domestic contact with rodents or shrews as a resident of guangdong province or  12 support  063 figure 2  some demographic variables were associated with self-reported sari andor ili symptoms as either independent or interactive terms for example respondents aged 41 to 60 and residents of yunnan province were less likely to report symptoms slaughtering poultry was positively associated with the outcome only in guangxi residents whereas the association was negative in guangdong residents family income also showed interactions with family income less than 10000 rmb being positively associated with the outcome in respondents who raised poultry but negatively associated in respondents who cooked or handled poultry gender was not found to be salient in either direction when asked about animals and disease transmission more than half of the study participants believed that animals could spread disease n871 56 and were worried about disease emergence from animals at wet markets n810 52 of those worried about disease emergence 46 n 370 purchased animals from wet markets in the past 12 months among all participants who purchased animals from wet markets in the past 12 months n502 32 some n194 39 took protection measures or strategies such as washing hands purchasing live animals less often n 153

06 are demonstrated here meaning they were identified as associated with the outcome for 60 or more of the bootstrap iterations odds ratios 1 orange are positively associated with the outcome and odds ratios 1 purple are negatively associated with the outcome we used a novel human surveillance approach to integrate serological and behavioral data to characterize associations between human-animal contact and zoonotic disease spillover risk in southern china this study provides the first serological evidence of bat-borne sarsr-covs and hku10-cov transmission to people and highlights potential spillover pathways through animal contact given the high diversity and recombination rate of bat coronaviruses and close relationship of sarsr-covs to sars-cov it is possible that exposure to these coronaviruses may lead to disease emergence in human populations continuous surveillance of both human and bat populations as well as further pathogenesis studies of these viruses are important to determine the extent of the disease risk contact with animals was prevalent among the survey population raising poultry and having rodentsshrews in the house were the most common types of contact correspondingly contact with poultry and rodents shrews as well as with carnivores was identified in the lasso regression as being associated with self-reported ili andor sari symptoms with results varying by income and province its important to note that the questionnaire used broad classification of the type of animals for these exposures due to the presumed variability in respondents capacity to identify species or genera of wildlife it is likely that the most significant exposure we identified to carnivores reflects animals as diverse as civets porcupines ferret badgers and taxas that respondents recognized as nonrodent and non-shrew this study also assessed health risks from human interaction activities for each study participant in the survey based on their travel history and the health history of people who they lived with the goal was to minimize the possibility that illness was caused by human-tohuman transmission of pathogens causing ili andor sari symptoms we did not find evidence supporting a direct relationship between bat contact and bat coronavirus sero-positivity in the human population however there is frequent contact with domestic animals in these communities and it is known that other bat-borne viruses have been transmitted to humans via livestock eg henipavirses and filoviruses 38 39 40 41  it is possible that these findings reflect other indirect exposures to bat covs and future surveillance may benefit from including a wide range of livestock and peridomestic animals in viral and serological studies to identify potential spillover pathways 42 43 44 45  while it is known that bias can occur in self-reported illness data this approach has been widely used in previous disease surveillance and risk factor studies 46 47 48 49  it is useful as an early warning system to assess broad categories of factors within high-risk communities in a nonoutbreak condition this is particularly important in rural regions where people have high levels of contact with domestic and wild animals but may not seek diagnosis or treatment in a timely fashion slowing early detection and response while the majority of survey respondents believed that animals could spread disease and were worried about disease emergence from animals at wet markets many did not take measures to protect themselves from exposure further work on what drives these local attitudes to risk may help in developing risk-mitigation behavior change programs a number of affordable and readily adaptable measures could be targeted to these at-risk populations including the use of gloves and masks while killing or butchering animals and handwashing the low levels of sero-positivity found in the study could reflect a number of factors 1 the rarity of spillover and bat-to-human transmission as has been reported for other virus-host systems 50 51 52 53 54  2 the use of a snowball technique for sample selection that could have biased the population sampled 3 the limited diversity of covs that this study tested for 4 the possibility that these infections cause high mortality rates and therefore the number of survivors and number of seropositive people is low although this seems unlikely because the mortality rate from sars was 10 during an outbreak that included hospital exposure and therefore likely high infectious doses 55 56  and 5 that antibodies to these viruses wane rapidly in humans the latter hypothesis is supported by findings that antibodies to sars decline rapidly 2-3 years after illness 57  expanding this approach to a larger population using a longitudinal repeated sampling approach and targeting people who are in the higher-risk categories identified here may provide a larger number of sero-positives and more critical information on the driving factors of viral spillover however despite the small sample sizes this study suggests that there are a substantial number of people in rural southern china who are exposed to bat-borne viruses and that exposure likely occurs through the daily or normal practices of rural communities rather than specific high-risk behaviours eg wild animal hunting considering the proven potential of some sarsr-covs currently circulating in bats in southern china to infect human cells cause clinical signs in humanized mouse models and lead to infections that cannot be treated with monoclonal therapies effective against sars-cov 58 59 60  this represents a clear and present danger to our biosafety and public health further studies to determine the relationship between sarsr-cov and hku10-cov exposure and illness in people may help elucidate this risk and provide critical mitigation strategies this study was approved by wuhan university school of health sciences medical ethics

mammals and birds in humans the virus causes respiratory tract infections which are mild but may be lethal in some cases coronaviruses are a group of an rnavirus and also known as a 2019-ncov virus coronaviruses are viruses in the subfamily orthocoronaviridae of family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and have a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry 8 31 the genomic size of coronavirus varies from 26 to 32 kilobase 7 coronaviruses are categorized into four genera ie alpha beta delta and gamma where alpha and beta are responsible for causing infection in humans 17 there are seven strains of human coronaviruses viz human coronavirus 229ehcov-229e human coronavirus oc43hcov-oc43 sars-cov human

an rrt-pcr assay for mers-cov the test is thru under the buff of an emergency use authorization but human error poor laboratory conditions and ignorance while testing the samples is such prevalent factors which could affect the capability and proficiency of rrt-pcr test for this rrt-pcr assay cdc recommended collecting multiple samples including lower and upper respiratory sample serum and stool specimen cdc considers a patient under examination to be negative for active mers-cov infection when one negative rrt-pcr test on the mentioned specimen cdc consider mers patient to be negative for active mers-cov infection followed by two successive negative rrt-pcr tests on all samples 1 the peoples who had infection to mers-cov serology test helps to identify antibody from them these types of antibody have the capability to attack attenuate kill the hosted virus within the immune system the presence of antibodies to mers-cov shows that a person had been formerly diseased with the virus and develops an immune response confirmation to date recommends there may be a wider range of mers disease than was initially thought for example a public health investigator has recognized individuals who are pcr-positive but have no mers symptoms we do not know if mers-cov can be spread by these people cdc has a two-phase methodology for serology testing using two screening tests and one confirmatory test to distinguish antibodies to mers-cov 6 the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa is a screening tests to detect the occurrence and concentration of specific antibodies that is bind to a viral protein cdc recommended elisa test for antibodies against two different mers-cov proteins viz nucleocapsid n and spike s to identify the neutralizing antibodies the microneutralization assay is a good confirmatory test which helps to measure specific antibodies in serum specimens however compared to elisa the microneutralization assay is a laboratory intensive and time-consuming method and requires at least 5 days before the result are available if a clinical sample is found to be positive either by elisa or microneutralization the specimen is determined to be confirmed positive 5 if a clinical sample is found to be positive by both elisas and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be intermediate if a clinical sample is found to be positive by only one elisa and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be negative 18 in the end a final determination of a confirmed positive serology the result needs to be a positive elisa test and confirmation by microneutralization assay mers-cov serology test is used for surveillance test not for diagnostic purpose-these are the tools which developed in response to the mers-cov outbreak in 1965 two scientists tyrell and bynoe studied the human coronavirus named b814 found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of a person with common cold the existence of an infectious agent was demonstrated by inoculating the medium form these cultures in human volunteers in this experiment colds were produced but the growth of agents does not occur at the same time other two scientists hamre and procknow got to succeed in growing virus with unusual properties in tissue culture from samples which were picked up from adults with colds hamre named this virus as 229e hamres virus 12 in the late 1960s tyrell with a group of scientists worked on human strains and other animal viruses which included infectious bronchitis virus mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine which were morphologically the same as seen through electron microscopy 12 this new category of viruses was called coronavirus and was accepted as new genus of viruses further research gives more information about the epidemiology of human respiratory coronaviruses like it was found that in temperate climates respiratory coronavirus infections occur more often in the winter and spring 29 after three decades of discovery human strains oc43 and 229e were studied like many other viruses the reinfection was common as the research continues to explore the pathogenicity and epidemiology of the human coronavirus the importance and number of animal coronaviruses were growing rapidly in 2003 the new virus sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was identified which first infected humans in southern china sars-cov killed 774 people and at least 8000 people were infected 23 sars infection affected 29 countries since 2004 there have not been any known cases in the world 16 the transmission of sars is primarily from person to person symptoms are like influenza-like and include fever malaise headache diarrhea and shivering the evolution of this virus demonstrated that this virus is not stable virus and can adapt to become more virulent even lethal to humans after that another outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 cause many deaths and later spread to other countries it was called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov as its origin was middle east the spread of infection occurred worldwide however most cases of deaths occurred in the middle east from2012 to 2018 the total number of cases reported was 2274 from 27 countries out of which 817 associated deaths were reported there are no further reports of cases of mers-covbut now in december 2019 there was an epidemic of new novel coronavirus in the city of wuhan china and was named as 2019-ncov 14 this infection is closely related to sars-cov and mers-cov 30 in december 2019 wmhc reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia most of the people who were infected had exposure to the huanan seafood market where poultry bats snakes and other wildlife animals were sold the cause of viral pneumonia was not sars mers influenza virus or adenovirus on january 10 reports came that the newly identified 2019-ncov has been isolated from patients with the help of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods on jan 2020 217 patients were infected with 2019-ncov out of which 9 patients died there are more than 20623 confirmed cases and at least 427 people have died as of 3 feb 2020 the virus has spread to at least to 20 countries including us australia thailand hong kong taiwan macau singapore japan south korea france malaysia canada germany nepal india and uae after close introspection from the chinses government it was tangible that the outbreak of covid-19 was ignited from fish and wild animal market of wuhan city china during november 2019 33 the virus has prominent intention to grown itself within the serum or raw blood within the mutilated bodies of animals birds and fishes after proper incubation within the animal blood the virus transmission occurs due to the human trespassing and mobilization as per who guideline to prevent an individual from contamination one can frequently wash hisher hand using sanitizer containing 70 ethanol 15 hydrogen peroxide 15 deionised water avoid unprotected animal contacts use of ffp1-3 mask as per whos most recent guideline march 31 2020 a patient with acute respiratory illness with certain symptoms of cough shortness of breath and a history of traveling in foreign territory is susceptible for community transmission of covid-19 disease heshe must be treated in quarantine at list for 14 days chloroquine has some devastative and quandary effects against any kind of rna virus ie hepatitis a and c rabies polio hiv influenza a and b influenza a h5n1 lassa zika hendra nipah and ebola virus 27 chloroquine has also some lethal effects against some dna virus as well such as hepatitis b virus and herpes simplex virus but unfortunately very few clinical researches have been carryforward to detect the antiviral activity of chloroquine as far as the corona virus pandemic is concerned benefits of chloroquine were remarkably reported for sars-cov-1 in in-vitro cell line studies it was confirmed that chloroquine has significant inhibitory effects on the replication of hcov- 229e in epithelial lung cell cultures the chloroquine has been most prominently active against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the chloroquine has significant impact on establishing endolysosomal pathway as sars-cov-1 virus try to vandalize this pathway hence chloroquine could be very effective against novel corona virus a recent paper stated that both chloroquine and antiviral remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 in vitro and proposed that these drugs to be assessed in human patients suffering from covid-19 as far as its mechanism of action is concern against novel corona virus it has multiple mechanisms in which in step-by-step it inhibits the pre entry of virus penetration within the cellular surface receptors the chloroquine was found to have inhibitory effects against enzyme called quinone reductase 2 a structural neighbor of udp- n -acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids the chloroquinoline interferes the biosynthesis of sialic acid by which human coronavirus hcov-o43 and the orthomyxoviruses cannot utilize sialic acid moieties as receptor due to which the virial glycosylation on virus cell surface receptor would stop due to alkylation of endosome chloroquine shows in-vitro anti-viral effect when added to vero cells prior to virus exposure the mechanism is likely to be rapid annulment of virus endosome fusion with fluctuation of endosomal ph through endocytosis based on the initial studies and positive outcomes of chloroquine indian council of medical research icmr on march 24 2020 suggested that those patients who are corona positive and the doctors and other healthcare professionals who are handling covid-19 patients are advised to take hydroxychloroquine a chloroquinoline derivative as a preventive drug as hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug has assumed prophylactic effects against covid-19 but as per forbes article by willam a haseltine march 25 2020 hydroxychloroquine has ineffective treatment of patients hospitalized with covid-19 the small controlled trails were conducted in shanghai public health clinical center china with 15 patients by giving 400 mg hydroxychloroquine dose for 7 days the results are not that much surprising when the treatment group was compared with the controlled group after ct scans it was observed that treatment group has less significance difference than the controlled group total 93 of patients in the control group tested negative for covid-19 after 7 days compare to 867 of patients in the hydroxychloroquine treated group the results were not that much favorable and statistically indistinguishable as per who on march 31 2020 no new country reported new cases on covid-19 for the last 24 h however the numbers of infected cases are alarming globally almost 75890 confirmed cases and 36405 deaths were reported till march 31 2020 as per who report more than 800000 surgical masks 873000 gloves 54000 n95 masks and 24000 face shields were exported in 75 countries along with covid-19 testing kits to 126 countries by operations support and logistics osl on 15 january 2020 the case of coronavirus 2019-ncov was reported by ministry of health labor and welfare japan mhlw from wuhan hubei province china 19 the patient was male age 3039 years living in japan the patient traveled to wuhan china in late december and had a fever on 3 january 2020 while staying in wuhan he did not visit the huanan seafood wholesale market or any other live animal markets in wuhan 13 he has indicated that he was in close contact with a person with pneumonia on 6 january he returned to japan and tested negative for influenza when he visited a local clinic on the same day 21 on 10 january 2020 due to his continued symptoms of cough sore throat and fever he visited a local hospital and was found to have abnormal chest x-ray with infiltrates 32 he was admitted to the hospital on the same day and had remained fevered 10 on 14 january his attending doctor notified the case to a local public health authority under the surveillance system for unidentified serious infectious illness samples were collected and sent to the national institute of infectious diseases niid and at niid polymerase chain reaction pcr testing and sequencing were performed twice which identified very small amount of 2019-ncov rna on 15 january 2020 13 on 20 january 2020 the first case of novel coronavirus was reported by national ihr focal point nfp for the republic of korea in the republic of korea the patient was a 35-year-old female chinese national residing in wuhan hubei province in china the case-patient had developed fever chill and muscle pain on 18 january while in wuhan she visited a local hospital in wuhan and was initially diagnosed with a cold on 19 january the case-patient was detected with fever 383 c upon arrival at the incheon international airport the case-patient was transferred to a nationally designated isolation hospital for testing and treatment the patient was tested positive was confirmed positive for novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 20 january by sequencing at the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc the patient had chills runny nose and muscle pain the case-patient did not report visiting any markets including huanan seafood wholesale market nor did she have known contact with confirmed 2019-ncov cases or wild animals in wuhan city the case-patient is currently under isolation receiving treatment and is in a stable condition 4 on 13 january 2020 the first imported case of coronavirus was reported by the ministry of public health mph thailand from wuhan hubei province chinathe patient was a 61-year-old chinese woman living in wuhan city hubei province china on 5 january 2020 she developed fever with chills sore throat and headache on 8 january 2020 she took a direct flight to thailand from wuhan city together with five family members in a tour group of 16 people the traveler with febrile illness was detected on the same day by thermal surveillance at suvarnabhumi airport bkk thailand and was hospitalized the same day 26 after the temperature check and initial assessment she was transferred to the hospital for further investigations and treatment 2 she reported a history of visiting a local fresh market in wuhan on regular basis however she did not report visiting the huanan south china seafood market from where most of the cases were detected 3 samples tested positive for coronaviruses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr on 12 january 2020 25 the genomic sequencing analysis performed by emerging infectious diseases health science center the thai red cross society eid-trc and the thai national institute of health thai nih department of medical sciences confirmed that the patient was infected with the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which was isolated in wuhan china for more information please see the disease outbreak news published on 12 january 2020 in india the patient was detected with novel coronavirus in keralas thrissur district and the patient kept in an isolation ward while the number of people under observation 28 the condition of the woman patient a medical student from wuhan university was stable 11 the woman now in an isolation ward at the general hospital in thrissur is likely to be shifted to the medical college hospital there soon health officials were awaiting a result of one more testgene sequencing only after which it can be stated that the patient was affected with the virus 24 three others who had returned from china are also in isolation wards in thrissur of the four students who returned from china one of them has tested positive of the total 1053 people under observation after traveling to china as many as 247 arrived in the state on thursday while 15 people including seven who got admitted on thursday are under observation in isolation wards at various hospitals across the state the remaining are under home quarantine so far a total of 24 samples have been sent to the national institute of virology in pune for testing and 15 of them turned out to be negative while that of the woman tested positive 20 after long hurdle and extensive research scientists have come to a conclusion that flavilavir an anti-viral drug has the potential to eradicate novel coronavirus this drug now subsequently promoted for marketing by national medical products administration since the outburst the flavilavir was developed by zhejiang hisun pharmaceutical company from the clinical research data it is postulated that flavilavir could play a game changer in the management of novel coronavirus in the above study of corona virus there are the various recent cases of corona virus affected patient human beings are addressed in the latest by 2020 so in the above article various causative agents and the mechanism of action of the corona virus are determined and studied the corona virus is of the various kinds and the most lethal corona virus is wuhan corona virus 2019 there are the two different diagnostic tests of the corona virus are discussed in the above study now days corona virus is spreading in the various regions of the world so maintain good hygienic conditions so that one should live a healthy life  journal pre-proof sars-cov-2 antibody testing -questions to be asked sars-cov-2 antibody testing -questions to be asked mustafa zrmez k andreas ambrosch oliver frey verena haselmann stefan holdenrieder michael kiehntopf michael neumaier michael walter folker wenzel roman wlfel harald renz   4710 words 48 patients and the assessment of immunity against the sars-cov-2 virus presents a 52 major cornerstone in handling the pandemic currently there is an increase in 53 demand of antibody testing and a large number of tests are already marketed or in 54 the late stage of development however the interpretation of test results depends on 55 many variables and factors including sensitivity specificity potential cross-reactivity 56 and cross-protectivity the diagnostic value of antibodies of different isotypes the use 57 of antibody testing in identification of acutely ill patients or in epidemiological settings 58 in this article the recently established covid-19 task force of the german society 59 for clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine dgkl addresses these issues 60 based on the currently available datasets in this rapidly moving field 61 antibody response covid-19 diagnostic pathway external quality assurance 63 immunity immunoassay neutralization assay respiratory infections serologic 64 analysis severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnostics were necessary and similar challenges existed with regard to the 85 evaluation of test results 1  a major difference to that time is the strong political and 86 economic pressure to insist on the most reliable high-throughput diagnostics there 87 is an urgent need for the development of appropriate laboratory tests to identify 88 infected patients follow the course of viral shedding and clearance and to assess 89 immunity against sars-cov-2 laboratory testing is built on two different pillars on 90 the one side the detection and measurement of viral rna and on the other side 91 measuring antibodies of various isotypes against sars-cov-2 components 92 reflecting the host immune response although antibodies are developing quite early 93 during the course of the disease the serological response is not suitable for early 94 detection of infected patients furthermore the clinical and immunological meaning 95 of these antibody responses is unclear since the many available tests do not 96 necessarily prove protective immunity against the sars-cov-2 virus furthermore it 97 can be questioned whether serological testing can be used as a surrogate marker 98 for viral encounter in this regard it remains unclear whether oligo-or 99 monosymptomatic cases -which are still the majority of all sars-cov-2 infected 100 patients -also develop this type of immune response in addition the longevity of the 101 persistence of these antibodies is still not clear there is increasing interest to use 102 antibody testing to assess the immune status of larger populations and also of the 103 risk population such as healthcare workers and others in order to help to draw conclusions from drastic measures such as economic and social lockdown social 105 distancing and other restrictive actions these key questions require immediate 106 attention in order to appreciate the strength and weakness of antibody testing 107 against sars-cov-2 this article summarizes the currently available knowledge and 108 literature in this extremely rapidly moving area 109 what are the approved indications to perform a covid-19 serology 111 in most patients antibodies against sars-cov-2 become detectable within the first 112 10 days after onset of symptoms of covid-19 also the kinetics of the class switch of 113 different isotypes of sars-cov-2 specific immunoglobulins is comparable to other 114 coronavirus infections 2-10  igm iga and igg antibodies were detectable in some 115 patients as early as day 1 after onset of symptoms the interquartile ranges of the 116 first antibody detection for igm and iga are between day 3 and 6 and for igg 117 between day 10 and 18 iga reached a plateau up to day 7 while igm and igg 118 continuously increased until day 14 and day 21 respectively 5  therefore serological 119 testing could be useful in several different aspects of covid-19 11  120 first and perhaps most important serological testing could supplement standard rt-121 pcr assays for diagnosis of covid-19 in symptomatic patients there is 122 accumulating evidence that viral shedding in the upper respiratory system profoundly 123 decreases 7-10 days after infection leading to negative swab results in at least 30-50 124 percent of covid-19 cases 612-14  measurement of sars-cov-2-specific antibodies 125 which begin to be detectable in a significant proportion of patients 5-7 days after 126 infection and later in almost all cases could help to detect cases with negative rt-since the immunological response triggered by an acute infection like covid-19 has 129 a certain latency 130 second serological testing is considered to be used to retrospectively determine 131 sars-cov-2 infections in people that previously have not tested positive by rt-pcr 132 for whatever reasons however the kinetics and the magnitude of the antibody 133 response seems to correlate with the clinical severity of the disease 45  preliminary 134 data suggest that an yet unknown number of asymptomatic infected and even 135 oligosymptomatic covid-19 patients do not develop seroconversion 16 17  136 there is a lack of validation data from ivd manufacturers who have systematically 137 examined asymptomatically infected patients therefore it is currently challenging to 138 establish cut-off values that are sensitive enough to determine the prevalence of 139 infection at the population level without running the risk of too high rates of false-140 positive results performance data about the roche antibody assay have been 141 currently released 18  the assay exhibited no cross-reactivity with 40 endemic hcov 142 convalescence sera ie it yieled a specificity of 100 95 confidence interval 143 912 to 100 more striking among 5272 pre-covid-19 sera collected from 144 routine labs n  3420 and blood donors n  1772 only 10 reactive sera were 145 identified ie a specificity of 9981 95 confidence interval 9965 to 9991 146 was achieved with increasing knowledge about sars-cov-2 the problem of 147 specificity could fade into the background in the future and the use of serology as an 148 epidemiological instrument become the next challenge 149 third and of utmost importance for the healthcare system and political decisions on 150 lock down measures is the ability of serological testing to establish indicators of 151 protection against re- infection with sars-cov-2 indeed sera from patients with plasma transfer from convalescent covid-19 patients demonstrate also in vivo 154 effects 419-21  however the efficacy of this therapy has not yet been confirmed in 155 sufficiently large controlled studies furthermore no direct conclusion can be drawn 156 about a reliable protective effect of the antibodies individually acquired during an 157 infection it is therefore conceivable that anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies can protect 158 against the virus however demonstrating a neutralizing activity of an antibody 159 against a virus requires assays using live or pseudotyped virus which cannot be 160 performed in a high-throughput fashion it is necessary to determine the targets of 161 protective antibodies in order to develop simple immunoassays that best reflect virus 162 neutralization this is especially important since certain target epitopes of antibodies 163 might also enhance virus entry 22  therefore total antibody measurements do not 164 necessarily reflect protection after infection nor do they indicate the efficacy of a 165 vaccination to ascertain immunity 166 in a cross-validation of 22 assays lateral flow tests and elisas to detect igm and 168 igg antibodies in covid-19 patients a significant number of positive results were 169 also found in historic sera from the pre-covid-19 era and from non-sars-cov-2 170 infections 2324 resulting in test specificities ranging from 84 to 100 for both 171 isotypes 95 confidence intervals 76 to 91 and 97 to 100 respectively the 172 reported specificity of 100 for both igg and igm was yielded by one of the lateral 173 flow assays however especially evident for igm sensitivity within the first 10 days 174 after patient reported symptom onset was lower as compared to the other assays 175 is the main determinant of the positive predictive value ppv the recently reported 177 prevalence of covid-19 in the population 2526 of 1  to 4  will result in a ppv 178 between 25 and 58 assuming a specificity of 97 and between 4 and 15 for 179 76 specificity respectively at an artificial sensitivity of 100 in all scenarios it is 180 therefore not possible to infer protection against sars-cov-2 from a positive result 181 of an immunoassay see figure 1  182 figure 2 shows an example of ppv  npv values y-axis as a function of prevalence 183 x-axis for theoretically assumed test sensitivities and specificities from 80 to 184 999 respectively and for two commercially available sars-cov-2 igg tests with 185 sensitivities of 8866 and 80 and specificities of 9063 and 985 respectively 186 applying these assay performance figures to testing strategies in the general 187 population predictive values of 22 to 79 ppv and 9997 to 9989 npv or 188 114 to 326 ppv and 9995 to 9982 npv can be calculated for a 189 prevalence of 024 regensburg bavaria germany or 09 26  respectively 190 clinical triage for covid-19 symptoms increases the pre-test probabilities towards 191 48 in hospitalized settings and will raise the ppv for the same tests to 8973 and 192 9801 while npv slightly decreases to 8965 and 8433 respectively protein as antigen 26-28 and is completed on day 14 in severe cases of ards 207 seroconversion seems to occur earlier 4  in mild or asymptomatic cases 208 seroconversion may even be absent 26  209 the detection of persistent infectivity cannot be conclusively verified by commercially 211 available rt-pcr because it is not possible to distinguish between replicable virus 212 components and inert genome fragments it is therefore assumed that rt-pcr 213 results lag behind the actual elimination of sars-cov-2 in infected individuals 214 the virological gold standard to prove infectivity is virus isolation in cell culture 13 iga within the first week of symptoms followed by igm and igg in the second week 231 as with sars and mers igm cannot be detected significantly earlier than igg 8  232 those antibodies which bind specifically to surface structures of sars-cov-2 like 233 the s protein prevent the virus from interacting with its target cell are called 234 neutralizing antibodies these antibodies play an important role in virus clearance as 235 they have the ability to block viral infection and are assumed to protect patients 236 serological tests for sars-cov-2 that are intended to confirm such neutralizing 237 antibodies must therefore be robust to the detection of other non-neutralizing 238 antibodies besides interfering factors that also occur in many other assays such as 239 heterophilic antibodies or human anti-animal antibodies immunogenic proteins of 240 closely related human coronaviruses can trigger cross-reactive antibodies in the host 241 this has been known for many decades and led to the earlier categorization of 242 corona viruses into serogroups 31  cross-reactivity with serum samples from hcov 243 patients has been shown for serological sars-cov-2 iga and igg antibody assays 4  244 therefore in order to make a valid serological diagnosis of sars-cov-2 neutralizing 245 antibodies it is essential to exclude cross-reactivity by a second confirmatory test 246 this is even more important when as in some commercial immunological test 247 systems the sars-cov-2 nuclear protein or parts thereof are used as an antigen not have a neutralizing effect on sars-cov-2 because the nuclear protein is located 250 inside the virus and is therefore not directly accessible 251 widely accepted confirmatory tests such as the virus neutralization test 252 recommended by the who during the sars outbreak 32  are labour intensive 253 resulting in slow sample throughput in diagnostic laboratories the establishment of 254 highly specific primary screening assays that avoid false positive results and thus the 255 need for further confirmation is therefore an important objective surrogate 256 neutralization assays using pseudotyped virus particles that bear the spike protein of 257 the sars-cov-2 virus do not require work inside high containment laboratories and 258 therefore might offer an alternative testing option in the near future 2033  259 another challenge for the serological detection of sars-cov-2 immunity is the 260 possibility of a low antibody response in mildly infected or even asymptomatic 261 covid-19 cases most severe sars-cov-2 infections lead to a robust immune 262 response 10  but on the other hand pcr-diagnosed mild or asymptomatic infections 263 can cause variable humoral immune responses that might not be detected by 264 serological tests 2034 or even fall below the detection limit in several patients within a 265 few weeks wlfel unpublished data  266 cross-reactivity and cross-protectivity may be two sides of the same coin in covid-267 19 too sars-cov-2 is closely related to hcov-oc43 another betacoronaviruses 268 the most prevalent seasonal coronavirus detected among patients under the age of 269 five 16  it has been hypothesized before that such a pre-existing cross-immunity may 270 confer protection andor attenuate the severity of covid-19 35  pre-existing cross-271 protective immunity in individuals previously exposed to antigenically related 272 pathogens have already been demonstrated for pandemic influenza a h1n1 in 273 entry of sars-cov-2 into the cell in mice 37  suggesting the possibility of an 275 mechanism analogous to influenza finally it should be mentioned that relatively 276 nonspecific antibodies such as might be produced by certain vaccination strategies 277 are suspected of being able to enhance a pathological immune response 2238  278 however first studies on vaccine antigens based on the rbd subunit of the s protein 279 did not show any evidence of such an antibody dependent enhancement 39  280 a growing number of in vitro diagnostic companies are developing sars-cov-2-282 specific antibody tests see httpswwwfinddxorgcovid-19pipeline in addition to 283 the differences and problems with test performance described above the different 284 assay techniques also differ in the conclusions that can be drawn from the results 285 table 1 gives an overview of assay techniques used in covid-19 serology different 286 antigens rbd n s1 have already been evaluated in various proprietary and 287 commercial elisa methods 4  antigen selection is one of the crucial aspects of assay 288 development that determines specificity availability and scalability for mass 289 production recombinant proteins are produced either by prokaryotic or eukaryotic 290 expression systems 40  prokaryotic systems achieve higher production rates but the 291 spectrum of suitable antigens is limited due to the lack of posttranslational 292 modification and may also influence their diagnostic performance 41  antigen 293 extraction from complete virus lysate is technically less complex but requires the 294 availability of ultracentrifugation and a bsl3 containment raw lysates are of 295 particular interest in the early stages of outbreaks when purified proteins are not yet 296 available after separation of the protein fractions virus lysates for western blotting 297 are used as a viable option for the validation of immunoassays and are also suitable 298 as confirmatory tests due to the high safety requirements these approaches for laboratories 42  301 the general issue of low ppv demands either robust sensitivities above 9999 or a 302 2-tier diagnostic process ie positive screening tests have to be confirmed eg by 303 western blot which is a serological standard for many decades 304 neutralization assays are the virological reference method for confirmation of 305 neutralizing antibodies plaque reduction neutralization tests and also more rapid 306 microneutralization tests have been described for sars-cov-2 antibody testing 1442 307 as all those techniques rely on usage of whole-virus preparations they are limited to 308 ideally standardization of cut-offs is one of the essential quality criteria that will affect 343 the intended use of covid-19 serology this is emphasized by who 344 recommending as of 24 th april 2020 scientific report to restrict the use of sars-345 cov-2 antibody testing to research settings until its diagnostic reliability is proven by with regard to the quality assurance of sars-cov-2 antibody tests there is an 370 urgent need for suitable reference material for large-scale validation studies 371 involving various available test systems and for international proficiency testing 372 initiatives there are different definitions of baseline samples and baseline studies a blood 376 draw to obtain a baseline serum sample is recommended for contacts of infected 377 persons as early as possible within the incubation period of contact 5960  for patients 378 paired samples are necessary for confirmation with the initial baseline sample 379 collected in the first week of illness and the second ideally collected 2-4 weeks later 380 the optimal timing for convalescent sample needs to be established 59  381 in a representative baseline study a demographically representative cohort is 382 repeatedly tested to determine the rate of spread of the virus this can be done by 383 serological analysis on blood donors by studies in particularly affected places 384 hotspots or nationwide in a carefully controlled population-representative study development study participants are urgent to collect blood from study participants 397 awaiting such tests in the near future these tests could become crucial to obtain fully interpretable and unbiased results from these studies for example it has 399 recently been proposed to collect samples and data in advance to test the hypothesis 400 that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering 401 chronic inflammation inflammaging and cellular senescence 61  402 while this procedure is straightforward within studies some countries may need 403 special regulations for implementation in the field of health care at present it is 404 conceivable that biobanks are established with noble intentions but may then be 405 opened for purposes for which prior consent of the patient would have been required 406 similarly this problem could also affect stored sera from employees at this point the 407 officials should verify the legitimacy of a proactive blood collection 408 following the introduction of pcr methods it soon became apparent that the 411 demand for test kits far exceeded their availability a major difference between 412 molecular and serological diagnostics is that the latter can be performed in almost all 413 diagnostic laboratories usually equipment is readily available personal 414 communication with the ivd industry currently estimates a demand only for a single 415 country like germany between 2000000 and 5000000 tests per month the 416 needed capacities may double as it can be assumed that most of the tested persons 417 have to be re-tested within one month the assumed increase is also triggered by the 418 examination of contacts of persons tested positive in a low prevalence setting 419 production capacities of high double-digit millions per month have already been 420 announced by one manufacturer it therefore remains to be seen whether the 421 forecasts for both demand and availability will be met to   comparison of four new commercial serologic assays for determination of sars-cov-2 igg alexander krttgen christian cornelissen g michael dreher mathias hornef matthias imhl michael kleines   in december 2019 the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in china leading to an ongoing pandemic 12 reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr of respiratory specimens represents the gold standard for identifying patients with acute sars-cov-2 infection as well as asymptomatic carriers its timely development allowed containment of the pandemic in many countries successful future management of the diseases spread will require the serological detection of past infection to determine immunity 3 especially in healthcare workers this is of outmost importance to identify immune personnel that will treat vulnerable patient groups and for the planning and management of infection preventive measures it also allows the identification of plasma donors for therapeutic interventions lately several commercial assays for the determination of sars-cov-2 igg became available in this study we compared four assays in respect to their sensitivity and specificity 75 sera of 56 patients hospitalized in the university hospital rwth aachen germany were included into this study 25 sera were collected from 25 patients with a negative sars-cov-2 pcr result in respiratory specimens 50 sera were collected from 31 patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr result in respiratory specimens sample and data acquisition were approved by the medical ethics committee of the university hospital rwth aachen ek 09320 three semiquantitative elisas the anti-sars-cov-2 elisa igg euroimmun germany the edi new coronavirus covid-19 igg elisa epitope diagnostics edi usa and the recomwell sars-cov-2 igg elisa mikrogen germany as well as one qualitative immunoblot based on a set of immunoassays in a microarray format the sars-cov-2 virachip igg immunoblot viramed germany were compared in this study for the detection of sars-cov-2-specific igg antibody titers in analogy to a previous study 4 the sars-cov-2 igg status of the sera was defined as follows a serum was regarded as sars-cov-2 igg negative if at least three of the four assays compared here had a negative test result applying the manufacturers interpretation criteria on the other hand a serum was regarded as sars-cov-2 igg positive if at least two of the four assays had a positive test result comparison of the kinetic of the sars-cov-2 igg titer was done using the three semiquantitative elisas and sera of 2 covid-19 patients of whom several consecutive sera were available to allow comparison of the semiquantitative values between assays the values were divided by the assay-specific cut off value for normalization normalized values of   1 represented a positive test result 75 sera were included in this study 25 of which were collected from patients with a negative sars-cov-2 pcr result and 50 from patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr result in respiratory specimens the sera of patients with negative sars-cov-2 pcr result were drawn on the day of pcr examination the sera of the 31 patients with positive sars-cov-2 pcr were collected 119 days  50 days post onset of symptoms each serum was tested in parallel with four assays for the presence of sars-cov-2 igg antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers three elisas from euroimmun epitope diagostics edi and mikrogen as well as one immunoblot from viramed the sars-cov-2 igg status of a serum was determined as described in study design using the euroimmun assay 21 sera were classified as sars-cov-2 igg positive 54 were classified as igg negative with the edi assay 25 sera had a positive result three an intermediate result and 47 a negative result the mikrogen assay and the viramed assay revealed 19 and 17 positive test results as well as 56 and 54 negative results respectively applying the criteria described in study design 22 sera were considered sars-cov-2 igg positive and 53 sera were regarded as igg negative all sera collected from patients with a negative sars-cov-2 pcr were sars-cov-2 igg negative 28 out of 50 patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr exhibited a negative antibody test the rate of correct positive and the rate of correct negative test results of the four assays is displayed in table 1
 they result in a sensitivity of 864 100 864 and 773 for the euroimmun assay the edi assay the mikrogen assay and the viramed assay respectively the corresponding results for the specificity are 962 887 100 and 100 the kinetics of the sars-cov-2 igg antibody titers could only be compared for the elisa assays resulting in semiquantitative values for comparison the semiquantitative test results were normalized as described in the study design section values of 1 and above represent positive test results we found that the kinetics of the sars-cov-2 igg antibody titers differed for each assay moreover the time point of seroconversion of each assays differed for both patients in one patient the edi assay was the first to give a positive test 8 days after onset of symptoms followed by the assays of euroimmun 9 days and mikrogen 10 days whereas in the second patient the mikrogen assay was the first to give a positive test result 8 days after onset of symptoms followed by the assays of edi 9 days and euroimmun 11 days thus it took at least 10 days after onset of symptoms to obtain positive test results in all three assays we also noticed that the edi assay has a smaller range of linearity compared to both of the other tests preventing the proportional detection of a further increase of antibody titers with time sars-cov-2 specific antibodies are usually only detected more than one week after onset of symptoms 5 limiting the role of serology for identification of acute infection however serologic assays are urgently needed to supplement the diagnostic repertoire in identifying patients with past sars-cov-2 infection this is important for i the prognosis of the further course of the pandemic ii the identification of presumably immune health care workers who can work with vulnerable groups of patients and iii the identification of potential plasma donors for therapeutic transfusion furthermore serologic assays might allow for the detection of patients presenting during a later stage of the disease when viral clearance may precede the disappearance of symptoms as today the elisa of euroimmun is the only validated commercial elisa available in germany according to a recent publication 3 this commercial igg specific elisa exhibited lower specificity and sensitivity compared to in house assays recently additional antibody test assays became commercially available the aim of this study was to compare four commercially available serological assays for sars-cov-2 igg the euroimmun assay and 3 new igg assays the strength of the edi assay is its high sensitivity however we found a comparatively low specificity and narrow linear range on the other hand the viramed assay is highly specific but showed the lowest sensitivity both the euroimmun assay and the mikrogen assay had a medium sensitivity regarding specificity the mikrogen assay reached a higher level than the euroimmun assay in our test setting in respect to the identification of sars-cov-2 igg positive health care workers and plasma donors with high levels of sars-cov-2 igg specific antibodies specificity and linear range are the most important aspects of the assays thus the euroimmun assay and the mikrogen assay appear to be most suited to fulfill both requirements with a somewhat better performance of the mikrogen assay in our experimental setting in conclusion the four tested sars-cov-2 igg assays showed sufficient specificity and sensitivity for identifying individuals with past sars-cov-2 infection moreover combination of two different assays may further increase sensitivity and specificity especially at early time points after onset of symptoms 10 days however more studies are necessary to fully assess the performance of these assays this

of serological colorimetric and clia tools remain to be ascertained  as of 25 aprile 2020 there are 3073603 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 positive cases 211768 deaths 1937184 active cases with 1880893 in mild conditions and 56291 in serious or critical conditions 1  this pandemic storm has forced each of us into a life-threatening situation with health systems even in the most advanced countries in crisis 2  in this scenario since the first cases have been reported in china we have learned that this infection can present with very heterogeneous clinical pictures in terms of clinical severity from completely asymptomatic to serious and potentially fatal forms 3  while the latter represent an often dramatic challenge requiring in some cases hospitalization in intensive care units on the other hand asymptomatic forms represent one of the determining factors for the spread of the infection 4 this event assumes particular relevance for some categories of workers in particular health care workers hcws considering their contacts with subjects who are frequently frail due to the pathologies from which they are affected and for which they turn to them in particular cancer patients represent a risk category with significant management challenges associated to both the risk of contagion and the possible major complications related to the infection 5 6  the incidence of contracting covid-19 infection has been 16 for hws who carried out their activity in departments dedicated to covid-19 patients 7  this percentage decreased to 41 for hcws who worked in wards with patients with respiratory symptoms without laboratory evidence of positivity for the virus 8  to date there are no published data indicating the incidence of asymptomatic positive covid-19 hcws working at a center dedicated exclusively to the treatment of cancer patients rt-pcr on naso-pharyngeal swabs is the standard test although it presents sensitivity problems and is not easily applicable to the general population serological tests rapid and easy to handle permit to study immunoglobulin expression of a virus contact in particular it is of particular interest the analysis of igm and igg which express recent or late contact with the virus 9  nevertheless this data acquired during previous coronavirus epidemic diseases is still to be defined for covid-19 10  for these reasons we planned to screen a cohort of hws at istituto tumori giovanni paolo ii of bari national cancer research center to verify the following issues 1 the applicability of a rapid serological test to an asymptomatic hcw population 2 the prevalence of sars-cov2 immunoreaction 3 the kinetics if igmigg in hcws at 2 weeks interval 4 the comparison of rapid serological test results with respect to

protect patients from a possible cross-infection hcw-mediated based on these considerations we verified the possibility to screen asymptomatic health-care workers with a serological test analyzing igmigg for sars-cov2 the study was designed to monitor the kinetics of immunoglobulins response to eventual sars-cov2 contact and to confirm performance of our colorimetric serological test with respect to standard rt-pcr on swab and clia-serologic test the first comment concerns the prevalence of serological test-positivity among our asymptomatic hcws sars-cov2 status of hcws in covid19

test as expected this prevalence value is significantly lower than that reported in symptomatic hcws from wisconsin 7 and in operating in covid19 structures experience 12  as far as we know this is the only study considering asymptomatic hcws from a non-covid19 cancer institute in which however a recent activated screening program for all hospitalized patients reported 1 of patients positive for sars-cov2 promptly transferred to specific covid19 hospitals the prevalence of ig positive subjects increases to 18 in the second round of serological tests after 14 days but interestingly one of them

variability of ig kinetics in sars-cov2 patients showing that igg specific can be found since early beginning of symptoms and conversely that igm can persist at high level even up to 25 days after symptoms appearance our study based on the utilization of a colorimetric qualitative serological test has not been designed to acquire quantitative information on ig kinetics but it has demonstrated that this assay can be of help in individualization of asymptomatic subjects with supposed occurred contact with sars-cov virus the last point is referred to comparison of viva-diag tm with results of molecular rt-pcr assay and clia serological test noteworthy viva-diag was able to find an asymptomatic hcws who successively resulted positive at molecular study this result is important but we have to comment that we screened about a thousand of hcws first and second round to find the positive one and even more interesting that the endpoint of serological tests is not to find the sars-cov2 positive subjetcs but rather to select those with supposed immunization due to previous contact with the virus 15  for what concerns the comparison of viva-diag with respect to

fifty-eight percent of patients with drvi had underlying chronic lung disease drvi was associated with upper respiratory tract illness lower respiratory tract illness including pneumonia systemic influenza-like illnesses and exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all of the common acute respiratory viruses were identified picornaviruses and influenzavirus a were the most common the rate of drvi 116 was highest in the epidemiological studies in which cell culture serology and polymerase chain reaction were used together patients with drvi were hospitalized

been reported in both inpatients and outpatients srvi one patient had one drvi and three srvis and was not hospitalized with any of these infections no patient with with diagnoses of upper respiratory tract illness lower respiratory tract illness systemic or flu-like illness and exacerbation both drvi and srvi was hospitalized with srvi and not drvi of asthma our review also found drvi to be associated with these various clinical presentations however no predilection for drvi in a specific clinical syndrome was apparent all of the usual respiratory viruses have been reported in cases of drvi in addition many studies include hsv 3 5 over the past 45 years more than 430 cases of drvi in immunocompetent hosts have been reported  24  reovirus 24  and mumps virus of drvi in these reports varies widely many published studies of acute respiratory illness report no cases of drvi 43 -53 28 have also been reported in drvi many of the studies in the literature do not specify which of the identified respiratory in the published studies in which drvis have been reported the rate of drvi ranged from 133 to 100 in a single case viruses were specifically involved in drvi in the studies that do specify the viruses involved in drvi rsv is generally the report in our study the overall rate of drvi was 5 but the rate of drvi in the individual epidemiological studies that we most common one and influenzaviruses a b and c parainfluenzaviruses adenoviruses and rhinoviruses also are fre-reviewed ranged from 18 to 158 the wide range of drvi rates in our studies and in the literature is due to multiple factors quently involved in our patients with drvi picornaviruses and influenzavirus a were the most common viruses followed including differences in patient populations eg differences in age and comorbid conditions time of study eg winter vs by coronavirus oc43 most of the published reports did not attempt to identify summer or during epidemics of respiratory virus infections and diagnostic methods employed both the literature and our coronavirus as an etiologic agent but lina et al 42 reported that 15 of 16 cases of drvi in their study included a coronavi-analysis show that the number of drvis identified increases with the number of viral diagnostic methods used rus coronavirus was detected in 328 of our patients with drvi while this virus was detected in only 23 of the patients most reports of drvi have involved children but there have been reports of drvi in immunocompetent adults as well our with srvi the increased frequency of coronavirus in cases of drvi may be an artifact of our viral detection methods study shows that a greater percentage of patients with drvi than those with srvi are 1 year old 25 vs 15 it is rather than a true difference our detection methods included pcr for coronavirus and 40 of our coronavirus infections unclear from the literature and our study why younger patients are more often dually infected with respiratory viruses the were detected by pcr alone in most of the published studies of drvi more than one immature immune system of infants and lack of previous exposure to respiratory viruses could increase susceptibility

in addition a small number of srvis were detected in asymptomatic patients but all or more respiratory viruses causes more-severe clinical illness than infection with a single respiratory virus tristram et al drvis were associated with illness whether drvis are associated with increased morbidity can only be determined by a 4 reported an increased incidence of respiratory failure among patients dually infected with rsv and adenovirus suggesting prospective clinical study in which patients with drvi srvi and respiratory illnesses without a known etiology are followed that drvi may be

parker s s cross and w p row croscopic studies revealed a morphology similar to other members of the coronavirus group which include mhv ibv and viruses isolated from the upper respiratory tract of humans 4 9 11  the virus termed rat coronavirus rcv was serologicmly distinct by the iap test from other viruses found to occur as indigenous virus infections in rodents rats mice and hamsters the agents associated with enzootic bronchiectasis 12 and endemic pneumonia 8 of rats were not available for comparison to icv however the identity of these agents as viruses is not convincing and it has been suggested that they are in fact mycoplasma 5  the virus isolated from the submaxillary glands of rats by aslt et al 2 is distinguishable from rcv on the basis of different physical properties icv is serologically related to mhv a similarity which initiated the present study and led to the isolation of rcv however although mhv and rcv are serologically and morphologically related they are clearly two separate and distinguishable viruses mhv and rcv produce similar cpe but each in a different cell line which is not reciprocally infected by the other virus the two viruses differ markedly in their pathogenicity the mhv complex produces encephalitis and hepatitis in mice and is normally an enteric infection 15  while rcv produces peumonitis in rats and is almost certainly spread by the respiratory route while mhv and icv are related viruses as shown by cf and neutralization tests mcitos et al 11 showed in an analogous manner that mhv and some of the ibv-like coronaviruses isolated from human respiratory tracts are also relate a number of technical problems have made it difficult to obtain information on tcv the widespread prevalence of rcv in rat colonies together with other frequently occurring respiratory viruses of rats such as sendai virus and pvm virus 14  have made it difficult to obtain suitable animals needed to carry out routine laboratory procedures infectivity titrations production of lung grown virus uncontaminated with other agents and preparation of monotypie antisera inadvertent eontamination of rat kidney tissue culture with kilham rat virus and it-1 virus occurred when rats from a colony harboring these indigenous infections were used for tissue culture the use of germfrce rats circumvented many of these problems however even with the use of germfree rats many lots of primary rat kidney tissue culture were observed to undergo a spontaneous cpe which was distinct from that produced by icv lecently a virus-like agent has been isolated from one of these degenerating cultures and presently is being studied this agent is cyclic or seasonal and during periods of high prevalence tissue culture studies with rcv were not possible in spite of these difficulties it has been possible to work with rcv but only as the result of routine and extensive monitoring for indigenous virus infections of rat colonies and of tissue cultures for viral contamination the narrow tissue culture range also presents great difficulties of the many tissue culture systems tested only the rat kidney cell culture system was sensitive and even this was not sensitive unless the cultures contained a large number of epithelial type cells chronic respiratory disease and rat pneumonia are the most serious diseases affecting aged rats and effectively block attempts by researchers to carry out long term holding experiments using aged rats a number of agents which have been incriminated in rat pneumonia might also play a role in the chronic respiratory disease syndrome these include pneumonia virus of mice pvm sendai virus enzootie bronchiectasis virus mycoplasmapulmonis and several bacterial species the most important being pasteurella pneumotropica 5  in addition to these agents it will be important in future investigations to study the potential role of rcv in the syndrome of chronic respiratory disease recent studies by kapikian et al 9 suggests that the ibv-like coronavirus isolated from the upper respiratory tract of man may be the etiologic agents of a portion of human respiratory illnesses which occur during the winter because of the apparent similarity in organ specificity of the human-ibv viruses and icv it would appear the rcv may be valuable as a laboratory model system  coronaviruses richard kaslow a lawrence stanberry r james le duc w arnold monto s benjamin cowling j j peiris s   coronaviruses of humans have been classified as a subfamily of the coronaviridae family the viruses are roughly spherical enveloped particles 120160 nm in diameter their name derives from the characteristic crown-like projections on their surface approximately 20 nm long they are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses are sensitive to heat and lipid solvents and have a distinct replication strategy common to other viruses in the order nidovirales 13 coronaviruses have in the past been divided into three groups in part because of increasing work on coronavirus discovery in the wake of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 a number of new coronaviruses of humans hcovs have been identified this has resulted in the three groups being reclassified as genera of the coronavirinae subfamily before the sars outbreak while it was recognized that the coronavirus infected many different species particularly domestic and laboratory animals their extreme diversity in nature was not fully appreciated although severe diseases of differing characteristics were known to occur in animals in humans the viruses were thought to cause only acute respiratory infection which were generally mild all this changed with the recognition that sars was caused by a coronavirus sars-cov this signaled that coronaviruses could produce lethal disease and encouraged more broadly based research on the agent and its prevention and control in the process two new respiratory or endemic coronaviruses have been identified as causing human infections which appear to resemble in epidemiologic characteristics those previously known very recently mers middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus a novel human betacoronavirus lineage c virus has been discovered zoonotically infecting humans in middle eastern countries in light of the differences between the endemic respiratory and the sars coronaviruses in terms of epidemiology and clinical expression they will be covered separately in much of this chapter coronaviruses were first identified from domestic and laboratory animals before they were identified in humans infectious bronchitis virus of chickens was actually isolated in embryonated eggs in the 1940s the late recognition of these viruses was in large part because of difficulty in recovering the human viruses using standard cell culture techniques 4 the first human coronaviruses were identified by different techniques in the united kingdom and the united states at approximately the same time the british medical research councils common cold research unit had been studying fluids collected from persons with natural respiratory infections by standard cell culture isolation methods and by inoculating them into human volunteers rhinoviruses or other cytopathogenic agents could be recovered from a portion of the fluids 5 there was an additional substantial portion from which no agents could be isolated but that could still cause colds in the volunteers organ cultures of human embryonic trachea or nasal epithelium were then used in an effort to detect the recalcitrant viruses present a specimen b814 that had been collected in 1960 from a boy with a common cold had not yielded a virus on inoculation into cell culture after the specimen had been passaged serially three times in human tracheal organ culture it could still cause colds on inoculation into volunteers which indicated that replication had taken place 6 in chicago during the winter of 1962 five agents were isolated in primary human kidney cell cultures from specimens collected from medical students with common colds the viruses were ultimately adapted to wi-38 cultures and exhibited a type of cytopathic effect cpe not previously seen a prototype strain 229e was selected for characterization and was found to be rna containing ether labile and 89 nm in diameter but distinct serologically from any known ortho- or paramyxoviruses sera collected from the five medical students all exhibited a fourfold rise in neutralization antibody titer against 229e 7 it became clear that these novel viruses were of more than passing significance when organ culture methods were added to standard cell culture techniques in a study of acute respiratory infections of adults conducted at the national institutes of health nih six viruses were found that grew in organ but not cell culture and were ether labile on electron microscopy the agents were shown to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv in structure and these represented a distinct family of viruses 8 the b814 and 229e strains were soon also demonstrated to have a similar structure on electron microscopy and to develop in infected cells by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles 9 10 as a result of the similarity of the human agents to ibv and also to mouse hepatitis virus mhv they were collectively considered to represent a group of vertebrate viruses distinct from the myxoviruses antigenically and structurally 11 the name coronavirus was eventually adopted for the group to describe the fringe of projections seen around them on electron microscopy 1 except for 229e none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture mcintosh et al reported successful adaptation of two of the nih isolates oc organ culture 38 and oc43 to the brains of suckling mice 12 these strains were shown to be essentially identical antigenically but quite distinct from mhv only oc38 and oc43 could be so adapted the other four oc strains resisted such attempts the ibv was known to exhibit hemagglutination under certain conditions but no such phenomenon had been demonstrated for the human strains until oc38 and oc43 were adapted to mice kaye and dowdle found that the infected brain preparations would directly and specifically agglutinate red cells obtained from chickens rats and mice 13 this technique greatly expanded the ability to do seroepidemiologic studies since it was simple and reproducible subsequent developments included adaption of oc38 and oc43 to growth in cell monolayers either mouse brain or organ culture material could be used as sources of virus 9 not only was cpe available for reading of neutralization tests but also the oc38 and oc43 viruses were found to hemadsorb red cells of rats and mice making available a more precise means of evaluating endpoints in tests involving these organ culture-derived strains 14 the other oc strains and b814 that could not be adapted to mouse brain resisted adaptation to cell culture as well these distinct viruses have since been lost and may actually have been rediscovered recently work on the coronaviruses of humans proceeded slowly with debate about how frequently the viruses caused lower rather than upper respiratory disease the methodological problems of working with them were a major impediment as was their apparent involvement only in a relatively mild disease all this changed when in 2002 sars appeared first in china and then in other countries of the world the near panic resulted because of its transmission characteristics case fatality and the fact that the agent was initially unknown that last aspect was solved quickly with the identification of the causative agent as a new coronavirus the knowledge that the virus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir spurred investigation of its possible source small mammals civet cats in live game-animal markets in guangdong were identified carrying closely related viruses this led to the identification of these animals as amplifier hosts and to the game-animal wet markets as an interface where zoonotic infection of humans was being initiated 15 the natural reservoir was later identified to be chinese horseshoe bats 16 17 the sars epidemic ended following the use of various population control measures and unexpectedly has not recurred however increased attention to the coronaviruses continued globally new coronaviruses were identified in various animal hosts and two additional coronaviruses were identified in humans the first since 229e and oc43 nl63 was identified in amsterdam in 2004 from a 7-month-old child with febrile bronchiolitis 18 the same virus was also isolated at almost the same time by the group in rotterdam from an 8-month-old child with pneumonia 19 the second virus hku1 was detected in a specimen collected from a 71-year-old man from china with pneumonia and then from another adult with the same diagnosis 20 with the development of real-time pcr techniques for all four human respiratory coronaviruses it has now become possible to identify them in many situations such identification is now typically done not only for these viruses but also for a variety of other respiratory agents this has meant that coronaviruses are now detected as much in clinical settings as in epidemiologic studies until the occurrence of sars coronaviruses of humans were not thought to cause death except possibly in those with underlying conditions this was in contrast to the situation in animals where infections were sometimes fatal depending on the particular virus since the sars episode the major change which has affected data on the respiratory coronaviruses has been more ready detection using the polymerase chain reaction pcr technique so that infections are now recognized in those who might previously have not been studied this has especially been the case in hospitalized individuals particularly those who will likely experience severe outcomes such as the immunocompromised it is also known from earlier studies that coronavirus frequently infects small children and reinfects adults including persons with chronic respiratory disease 21 it would be logical to assume that deaths could occur in these most susceptible segments of the population but they are probably not very frequent a problem during sars was in defining the specificity of infection whether inapparent mild or fatal this was related to the lack of a readily available diagnostic test in many areas where outbreaks occurred to a large extent cases were classified using a clinical case definition in some cases that survived there was an attempt at serological confirmation since the coronaviruses of humans other than the sars virus usually produce illnesses indistinguishable from those caused by other respiratory viruses it is not possible to define morbidity in the absence of laboratory identification before pcr became available it was difficult directly to identify the infecting virus thus besides anecdotal reports most of the epidemiologic studies were based on identifying rises in antibody titer in contrast since development of the pcr technique direct identification has become relatively simple however this seeming advance has often been accompanied by the use of the method to determine the incidence of infection in population groups and to define characteristics of associated disease or even seasonality the major problem is the short duration of many of the available studies and the concentration on hospitalized individuals as a result while it is possible to say these viruses can sometimes cause hospitalization and to infer the particular clinical diagnoses they produce it is difficult to estimate what proportion of overall illnesses are severe a small number of studies have been population based and have produced the only data available for determining the overall impact of illness 2224 while the older population-based studies were limited to 229e oc43 or both they are useful since there are few recent investigations that give the same information they were conducted in different settings but in some cases contemporaneously which allows direct comparison in fact almost no studies include all four recognized coronaviruses and cover more than a single year this makes it difficult to discuss year-to-year variation in frequency of activity as well as seasonality as was possible with the older data such studies are therefore of continuing interest at least as background in determining the long-term occurrence of the viruses these original investigations were typically broadly based with coronavirus infection forming part of overall evaluations of the role of viruses in general in respiratory illnesses as indicated in the selected listing in table 101 a variety of different open and closed populations were used for these studies the 229e strain was originally isolated from medical students in chicago as part of a long-term study of respiratory illnesses in young adults 7 25 employee groups were the source of specimens in the nih 26 27 and in the studies at charlottesville virginia 30 infection was also evaluated in childrens homes 28 and boarding schools 5 among military recruits 34 and among children hospitalized for severe respiratory illnesses in various parts of the world 26 serological methods were used to detect occurrence in persons with acute exacerbations of asthma 33 or chronic obstructive respiratory disease 21 patterns of coronavirus infection were identified among the general population residing in the tecumseh michigan community as part of a longitudinal study of respiratory illness 31 32 also included in table 101 are more recent studies using pcr to identify infection the previous studies based on serology often did not characterize infections identified clinically in fact challenge studies of volunteers were employed early to determine characteristics of illnesses because of problems associated with direct isolation 35 36 the more recent studies were able to characterize the illnesses clinically but have other limitations as indicated above
 relatively simple serological technique was available for the first two coronaviruses identified 229e and oc43 and surveys of antibody prevalence were carried out in various parts of the world many surveys formed a part of studies directed mainly toward determination of incidence of infection information on the prevalence of antibody was available for populations in the united states 27 30 31 the united kingdom 36 brazil 37 and other parts of the world a special situation was determining the meaning of the presence in man of antibody against coronaviruses of animals the finding of mouse hepatitis antibodies in military recruits and in children and adults from the general population was surprising when first described in 1964 38 it is now recognized that this did not indicate past experience with mhv but rather with human coronavirus strains known to cross-react with it similarly antibodies in human sera against the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine and the coronavirus of calf diarrhea also appear to represent cross-reactions with oc43 or related strains 29 39 in contrast in a survey of antibodies to avian ibv none could be found in a military population low-level antibodies were detected only in a portion of subjects who had close contact with poultry 40 the virus is not known to cross-react with the human strains more recently following a gap in active work on the epidemiology of coronaviruses elisa methods have been developed for at least some of the viruses 41 42 these have not been as much used as the older techniques given the availability of pcr and may not be as specific to the particular strain laboratory diagnosis can be achieved by identification of the virus in clinical specimens using virus isolation or antigen or molecular detection techniques identification of infection can also be accomplished by detecting a host antibody response relevant specimens for virus detection are typically respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal aspirates washes or swabs nose or throat swabs and when available endotracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavages in the case of sars in which disseminated infection may occur viral rna could also readily be detected in the feces and in the serum or plasma although pcr-based methods are becoming the gold standard in diagnosis virus isolation is indispensable for characterizing virus studying pathogenesis determining susceptibility to antivirals and developing novel antivirals and vaccines the human coronavirus 229e was originally isolated in cell culture and later adapted to roller culture monolayers of human embryonic lung fibroblast cells such as wi-38 and mrc-5 a cytopathic effect of small granular round cells appears at the periphery of the cell monolayer 7 although these cells can be used for the cell-adapted prototype 229e virus strain primary isolation of new 229e-like agents remains difficult the human embryonic intestine ma177 semicontinuous cell line has been used for the primary isolation of other 229e-like viruses 26 human coronaviruses oc38 and oc43 not related to 229e were originally isolated in organ cultures of human trachea or lung 6 8 43 44 these two strains are similar and have been further adapted to replicate in suckling mouse brain and to primary monkey kidney and bs-c-1 cell cultures 9 12 14 another cell system li32 a heteroploid human lung line has been reported to be suitable for primary isolation of 229e a related virus lp and the b814 the first-described organ culture agent 45 46 this last finding has not been confirmed by other workers 9 similarly mrc-c cells have been used for 229e-like viruses and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells for propagating 229e and oc43 47 48 human coronavirus nl63 was initially isolated in african green monkey kidney cells llc-mk2 18 human colon carcinoma cells caco-2 have recently been shown to be more susceptible to nl63 infection and show more prominent cytopathic effect 49 hku1 was initially discovered in 2005 by broad-range primers designed to detect all known coronaviruses rather than being specific for known coronavirus types reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr 20 and new isolates remain difficult to grow reproducibly in the laboratory however it has been successfully cultured in human ciliated airway epithelial cells hae 50 sars-cov was initially isolated in 2003 on african green monkey kidney epithelial cells veroe6 and in fetal rhesus kidney cells 51 52 during the sars epidemic in 2003 veroe6 cells which are deficient in interferon induction continue to be the cells of choice for culturing sars-cov at present following isolation of this novel agent electron microscopy and molecular methods random primer pcr and virus detection arrays followed by partial genetic sequencing led to its identification as novel coronavirus recently mers a novel human coronavirus of the betacoronavirus lineage c has been detected in patients from middle eastern countries with severe pneumonia and renal dysfunction vero and veroe6 cells are suitable for primary isolation of this virus from clinical specimens 53 continuous transformed cell lines do not mimic the physiological state of cells in tissues in vivo and this may be the reason why many coronaviruses are difficult to culture in vitro the use of primary cells from the relevant species cells differentiated in vitro in airliquid interface cultures and ex vivo organ cultures as was used in the early days of virology may be needed for the isolation of more fastidious viruses since some animal viruses are more readily isolated in culture although they are species-specific in their in vitro growth characteristics especially on primary isolation 5457 embryonated egg culture has been used as a host system for avian coronaviruses 58 however none of the plethora of bat coronaviruses detected by rt-pcr have been readily cultured in vitro to date even in primary bat epithelial cell lines 59 immunofluorescence tests on cells from the respiratory tract eg nasopharyngeal aspirates or swab using commercially available reagents 60 or polyclonal 61 or monoclonal antibodies to 229e and hku1 62 63 have been reported but these are not widely used such antigen detection tests can also be used for the diagnosis of sars-cov infection 62 several elisa systems have been developed to detect coronaviruses including coronavirus 229e 64 and the nucleocapsid n or spike s proteins of sars-cov in respiratory samples 65 66 since the majority of human coronaviruses cannot be readily cultured in vitro reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr and real-time quantitative rt-pcr have become the methods of choice for detecting and quantifying coronaviruses in clinical samples and for discovering novel viruses rt-pcr methods were used for the detection of 229e and oc43 viruses in clinical specimens 67 there are now a number of commercial assays that detect a range of respiratory pathogens including coronaviruses by the use of a combination of pcr amplification together with nucleic acid hybridization in luminex bead assay formats these methods provide the opportunity for the rapid detection of a panel of over 15 respiratory viruses including a number of coronaviruses in a clinical specimen however the sensitivity is generally less than that provided by individual rt-pcr methods 68 69 apart from detection of known coronaviruses rt-pcr is useful in virus discovery and further characterization this includes a wide range of coronaviruses in bats detected solely by such broad-range rt-pcr methods because these viruses cannot at present be cultured 70 for example the first identification of hku-1 as a cause of human disease was initially based on detection of viral rna in clinical specimens by broad-range rt-pcr with primers designed to detect all viruses within the coronavirus family 20 nl63 was discovered using the vidisca virus-discovery-cdna-amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism method 18 amplified sequences from rt-pcr permit viral genome sequence analysis which sheds light on virus structure characteristics biological properties phylogeny host and tissue tropism epidemiology cross-species transmission and drug design 53 7175 the demonstration of rising antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera to a specific viral antigen provides evidence of recent infection while the detection of antibody in seroepidemiologic surveys provides evidence of past infection methods that can be used for serodiagnosis have included the complement fixation test neutralization test indirect immunofluorescent if assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa hemagglutination-inhibition hi and gel-diffusion tests are less frequently used nowadays neutralization test can also be used on coronaviruses that only grow in organ cultures 8 neutralizing antibodies could be detected as early as 510 days after symptom onset during sars infection 76 the seroprevalence for sars-cov in asymptomatic children and adults living in high- and low-risk regions in hong kong in 2003 showed that subclinical infection was rare 77 78 pseudotyped virus expressing the sars spike protein can also be used for detecting neutralizing antibody to sars-cov without the need for handling the live sars-cov which has to be carried out in bsl-3 containment 79 indirect immunofluorescence tests use virus-infected cells fixed to inactivate virus infectivity as the solid-phase antigen to bind antibody in serum specimens anti-sars-cov antibodies present in the serum would bind to the viral antigens expressed on the infected veroe6 cells these primary antibodies could then be detected by adding secondary antihuman antibodies labeled with fitc 80 igm subclass antibodies to sars-cov though declining in titer can be detectable for more than 6 months after onset of disease there is less of a decline in titers of igg antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to the virus such assays can also be adapted to detect low- and high-avidity igg antibodies both for discriminating early from late antibody responses and for distinguishing anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses from primary specific responses this may be useful in some clinical situations 81 elisa assays have been also developed for detecting antibodies to coronaviruses 82 83 and have been used to investigate the epidemiology of coronavirus infections 84 the elicited antibodies detected by elisa predominantly react with the viral surface proteins rather than the ribonucleoprotein 85 and infections of 229e- and oc43-like viruses can be distinguished in elisa assays 86 elisa has been used to study the seroprevalence of hku1 showing an increase from 0  in age 10 years old to a plateau of 216  in the age group of 3140 years old 87 recombinant protein-based elisa assays for detecting antibody to sars-cov have been developed 88 89 the duration of antibodies by elisa to the sars-cov spike protein was long-lived and paralleled neutralizing antibody responses while those to the nucleoprotein was less long-lived 90 a protein-based line immunoassay which individually detects antibody to hcov 229e nl63 oc43 hku-1 and sars-cov nucleocapsid protein has been evaluated 91 paired sera from confirmed oc43 or 229e infections and 49 convalescent sera from sars patients showed that there was considerable cross-reactivity between the two betacoronaviruses oc43 and hku1 and between the two alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 however 229e- or oc43-infected patients did not develop cross-reactive antibody to sars-cov it is important to keep in mind such cross-reactions when evaluating the results of serological assays it is also relevant that immunofluorescent assays appear to manifest the greatest cross-reactivity neutralization tests are likely to be the most specific although this has not been systematically studied with the recently discovered coronaviruses historically cf or hi tests were used in epidemiologic studies of coronaviruses 7 by this method the cf test detected antibody in low titer and for only a short time after infection however if the antigen was highly concentrated antibody could be detected at a higher titer and this antibody persisted in the population so that the cf method could be employed in surveys of prevalence 92 an indirect hi test for 229e virus using tanned sheep erythrocytes has been described which appears to be highly sensitive with no cross-reactions with oc43 virus 93 cf tests can be satisfactorily performed with oc43 virus using infected suckling mouse brain as antigen 27 the same mouse brain material can also be used in the hi test for oc43 antibody in this test the hemagglutination titer has been higher for rat than for chicken erythrocytes but sufficient with the chicken cells so that hi testing could generally be employed this is of particular importance in view of the wider availability of chicken erythrocytes and the spontaneous agglutination that often complicates working with rat erythrocytes serum to be tested did not require treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme but rather standard heat inactivation at 56 c the agglutination took place equally at various temperatures including room temperature 94 it has also been possible to demonstrate precipitin lines on gel-diffusion tests with coronavirus antigens concentrated 10- to 50-fold two or three precipitin lines were observed by bradburne 92 in tests with hyperimmune animal or human serum but others have identified only one such line 94 the neutralization cf hi gel-diffusion and immunofluorescent techniques have been used in the antigenic analyses of the older strains of 229e and oc43 36 95 cross-reactive antibody responses among hcovs have been reported when sera from individuals experimentally infected with 229e- and oc43-like coronaviruses including organ culture viruses were tested they are found to cross-react within each group but not across groups thus it is possible that the elisa test with 229e and oc43 antigens may be able to detect infection with most if not all human 229e and oc43 coronaviruses 86 however persons with antibody to 229e and oc43 most of the adult population did not have cross-reacting antibody to sars-cov even in immunofluorescent tests allowing these serological tests to be reliably used for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of sars patients who had oc43 infections without prior exposure to sars-cov had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting oc43 virus but not to sars-cov however antibody responses to sars-cov antibody were sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting igg antibody titers for human coronaviruses oc43 229e and nl63 by immunofluorescent assays this probably reflects anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses to coronaviruses to which the patient has had prior exposure ie similar to the concept of original antigenic sin 96 97 the cross-reactivity is less when purifying nucleocapsid proteins are used in elisa or western blot assays all human coronaviruses hcovs are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses and belong to the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae order nidovirales the subfamily coronavirinae is further divided into three genera alpha- beta- and gammacoronaviruses corresponding to the previous informal classification groups i ii and iii respectively there is also a recently recognized deltacoronavirus genus 98 99 fig 101 the genus betacoronavirus consists of four separate lineages designated from a to d which correspond to the former subgroup 2a to d as viruses sharing more than 90  amino acid aa sequence identity in the conserved replicase pp1ab domain are treated as the same species oc43 and human enteric coronavirus hecv are thus now regarded as one species betacoronavirus 1

 at present only members of alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans they differ from each other in nsp1 protein which is distinct in size and sequence gammacoronaviruses have no nsp1 in addition alphacoronaviruses commonly share an accessory gene designated as orf3 the type species for alpha- and betacoronaviruses are alphacoronavirus 1 equivalent to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev in older literature and murine coronavirus equivalent to mouse hepatitis virus mhv respectively the viruses that are human pathogens are the alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 the betacoronavirus lineage a viruses betacoronavirus 1 which comprises oc43 and human enteric coronavirus which are now regarded as variants of the same species and hku1 and the betacoronavirus lineage b virus sars-related coronavirus 98 recently mers middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus a novel human coronavirus in lineage c has been isolated phylogenetically it is closely related to bat viruses previously detected in china and in europe 53 the name coronavirus comes from its appearance under the electron microscope with large 20 nm petal-shaped surface projections spikes on a 120160 nm spherical or pleomorphic body resembling a solar corona 100 fig 102 lineage a betacoronaviruses display an additional surface projection the 57 nm homodimeric hemagglutinin-esterase he glycoprotein the interior ribonucleoprotein looks like either a long strand with 12 nm diameter or a helix condensed into coiled structures with 1020 nm diameter the virions are sensitive to heat lipid solvents nonionic detergents formaldehyde oxidizing agents and uv irradiation 98

 the genome of coronaviruses consists of a linear positive single-stranded rna between 26 and 32 kilobases and is the largest rna virus genome to cause infection in humans 101 the infectious genome has multiple open reading frames orfs six of which are conserved across the subfamily and are arranged in 53order as orf1a and 1b which encode for two huge polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and the orfs for structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n the two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from orf1ab are autoproteolytically cleaved into about 16 nonstructural proteins nsp which subsequently form into the replicase between the structural proteins s m e and n lies the orfs coding for the accessory proteins whose function is not essential for virus replication in vitro and the functions of many of them in vivo are still unknown as a positive-sense rna genome genome of coronaviruses serves as template for both replication and viral protein synthesis following entry into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and uncoating of the virus genome orf1ab of the genome is first translated to generate replicase proteins these replicases use the positive viral genome as the template to generate full-length negative-sense rnas which in turn serve as templates for generating additional full-length genomes ie replication in viral protein synthesis the 3 proximal genes of the viral genome are first transcribed to segmented subgenomic negative-sense rnas by discontinuous minus-strand rna synthesis the process is initiated at the 3 end of the genome and proceeds until they encounter one of the transcriptional regulatory sequences trs that reside upstream 5 of most orfs through base-pairing interactions the nascent transcript is transferred to the complementary leader trs and transcription continues through the 5 end of the genome therefore all mrnas of a coronavirus characteristically contain a common 5 leader sequence fused to a downstream gene sequence these subgenomic rnas then serve as templates for positive-sense mrna production and subsequent translation into viral proteins 101 three structural proteins s e and m are found on the viral lipid-membrane envelope these are acquired as the virus buds into the endoplasmic reticulum intermediate compartment andor golgi complex of the host cell 98 the spike protein s is a large homotrimeric type i membrane glycoprotein 11281472 aa the s protein carries the receptor binding domain and is a class i fusion protein that triggers fusion between viral and host cell membranes within the endocytic vesicle thereby releasing the genome into the cytoplasm the envelope protein e is a pentameric integral membrane protein 74109 aa that acts as ion channel for preferential transport of different ions into the virion although present in low copy number in a virion e is significantly involved in virus budding morphogenesis and intracellular trafficking 102 the membrane protein m is an integral type iii triple-spanning membrane protein 218263 aa being the most abundant protein in the viral envelope it is essential in virus assembly within the infected cell it could also interfere with host immune responses by inhibiting type i interferon production 103 104 the nucleocapsid protein n is a phosphoprotein that encapsidates the rna viral genome to form ribonucleoprotein complex and regulates viral replication and translation 349470 aa it has rna chaperone activity and also functions as an interferon antagonist 105 in addition to these the group a betacoronaviruses includes oc43hecv and hku1 express an extra accessory homodimeric type i envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin esterase he on its surface it is related to subunit 1 of the influenza c virus hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein hef and mediates reversible virion attachment to o-acetylated sialic acids 106 the frequency of 229e illness and infection was determined in several long-term investigations the activity of 229e was found to be high in three out of 6 years of a study among chicago medical students the mean annual incidence of infection during the total period was 15  where the criterion for identification was a reproducible twofold seroconversion determined by cf there was marked year-to-year variation in infection frequency ranging from a high of 35  of those tested in 19661967 to a low of 1  in 19641965 however nearly 97  of the infections occurred during the months from january to may often at a time when isolation of rhinoviruses was at a low and seroconversions for 229e were only rarely accompanied by a rise in titer against another respiratory agent 25 the serological study of 229e activity in the community of tecumseh michigan initially covered 2 years which included one period of high prevalence as with the study in chicago routine blood specimens were collected so that infection rates could be determined however the study group was composed of individuals of all ages living in their homes over the 2 years infections were detected in 77  of individuals tested by cf as shown in the curve in fig 103 however this appeared to be an underestimate of the actual activity of the virus serum specimens had been collected on a regular basis 6 months apart rises in titer by cf occurred most frequently in those pairs in which the second specimen was collected in april 1967 clearly indicating the peak period of viral dissemination both cf and the more sensitive n test results were combined to give an overall infection rate for the population studied this rate 34  was remarkably similar to the 35  observed in chicago at the same time because of the limited period of viral activity it was possible to compare illness rates of those infected with persons not infected matched by age and sex it was estimated that 45  of the infections had produced clinical disease thus the rate of 229e-associated illnesses during the outbreak was 15 per 100 persons studied activity in all age groups was apparent including those under 25 years of age 31

 in other investigations of 229e activity attention has been directed mainly toward study of associated illnesses in such studies sera have been collected before and after the illness rather than continually on a routine basis as done to determine infection rates employees at state farm insurance company in charlottesville virginia were studied during an 8-year period for rises in titer for both 229e and oc43 by cf 229e infection could be related to 3  of the colds that occurred in the winterspring and to 04  of colds that occurred in the summerfall there was some year-to-year variation in activity but differences in the number of specimens tested from various years did not permit complete identification of cyclical patterns 30 employees of the nih with respiratory illness were studied by both isolation and serology for 229e infection over a 6-year period again attention was specifically directed toward certain segments of the 6 years and no specimens were tested during other segments of particular interest once more is the segment from december 1966 to april 1967 isolation of rhinoviruses and myxoviruses was uncommon at this time but respiratory illness continued to occur during this period 24  of those persons with colds studied had rises in titer for 229e as part of the same investigation paired blood specimens collected from infants and children admitted to the hospital with acute lower respiratory disease during the 1967 period of 229e activity were tested for rise in antibody against the virus but none was found 26 27 healthy children institutionalized in atlanta georgia were studied from 1960 to 1968 antibody response to 229e was determined by the indirect hemagglutination test the investigation involved collection of serum specimens related to illness and also routine collection of sera from some non-ill individuals frequency of infection showed marked variation from year to year overall 4  of colds could be associated with 229e infection with greatest association in autumn winter and spring 28 a more recent study took advantage of specimens sent from medical facilities in edinburgh scotland for laboratory identification of infection to study the incidence of a number of respiratory viruses identified by pcr overall 229e was found in only 03  of those sampled lowest of any of the four coronaviruses studied this may reflect that the source of the specimens was from illnesses seen in hospitals and primary care facilities and coronaviruses are mainly involved in milder illnesses 22 surveys of prevalence of 229e antibody have been carried out to document past history of infection often as parts of longitudinal studies a general finding is that antibody is present in a significant portion of adults who despite possessing this antibody can subsequently experience reinfection and illness reports of antibody prevalence in adults in the united states have varied from 19 to 41  depending on the type of test used to determine antibody and the time of collection of serum 27 30 110 children under 10 years of age exhibited lower mean antibody titers than older children or adults 27 31 individual sera from normal healthy adults collected serially in britain from 1965 to 1970 were tested by bradburne and somerset it is of interest that the proportion of sera positive by cf increased from approximately 17  in specimens collected in octoberdecember 1966 to 62  in those collected in julyseptember 1967 this suggests that the spring 1967 outbreak that occurred in several parts of the united states may have taken place in britain as well populations employed to study infection and illness caused by oc43 virus were generally been the same ones employed to study the occurrence of 229e virus kaye et al 107 used the group of institutionalized children in atlanta georgia to identify infection by means of their hi test infections with the agent were detected in all years of the study but with definite cyclical variation seasons most involved were the winter and spring overall 3  of the illnesses recorded in the 7-year period could be associated with oc43 infection with a high of 7  in 19601961 interestingly testing of the sera collected routinely from non-ill individuals indicated that an additional equal number of oc43 infections were occurring without the production of symptoms 107 the charlottesville study of adult employees was of both oc43 and 229e infections here too the emphasis was on illness and in all years studied oc43 was associated with 5  of colds in the winterspring and with no illnesses in the summerfall again there was cyclical variation from year to year in the number of rises in titer detected 30 the original isolations of oc38 and oc43 were made in december and january 19651966 as part of the study carried out among nih employees with colds testing of sera collected from these employees indicated that during this period up to 29  of the colds studied were accompanied by rise in titer for oc43 in the children hospitalized with lower respiratory disease up to 10  of illnesses during this period were associated with such a titer rise however it was impossible to show that the relationship to disease was truly etiologic this finding was in contrast to that seen with 229e in which no rises in titer were detected in such cases 27 111 in the tecumseh study occurrence of oc43 infection was determined in the community population over a 4-year period cf and hi tests were used on all specimens and n tests were used as an aid in evaluating these results in selected specimens during the total period oc43-related infection was detected in 171  of the 910 persons studied for 1 year most of the infections took place in the winterspring months of 19651966 19671968 and 19681969 the only winterspring period without such activity was in 19661967 when the 229e outbreak had taken place the 19681969 outbreak of oc43 infection was nearly as widespread as the prior 229e outbreak with 256  of the population studied showing evidence of infection of special note was the fact that children under 5 years of age had the highest infection rates 32 112 more recently in the edinburgh study involving medical care oc43 was the most commonly identified coronavirus but only was identified by pcr in 085  of specimens this again may be a reflection of the source of the specimens surveys of antibody prevalence have been conducted in several settings using oc43 antigens mcintosh et al 27 found that children began to acquire antibody to this virus in the first year of life by the third year of life more than 50  had antibody present among adults 69  could be demonstrated to have antibody this indicates in view of the high incidence of infection with the agents in all age groups the frequency with which such infections must represent reinfection the high prevalence of antibody has been confirmed in other studies 28 30 112 in britain bradburne and somerset followed prevalence of antibody for oc43 over time as they also had done with 229e 36 each year the greatest prevalence of antibody was found in the winterspring period the single highest point in antibody prevalence was in januarymarch 1969 at the same time the oc43 outbreak was occurring in some parts of the united states 30 38 occurrence of coronavirus infection has now been documented by isolation pcr or serology throughout the world in earlier studies in the united states in addition to the studies listed in the first part of table 101 a 229e-like virus was isolated in california and oc43 and 229e have been demonstrated to be present in many regions of the country 21 113 extensive studies have been carried out by the common cold research unit which have demonstrated the presence of the agents in britain the activity of 229e virus has been documented in brazil in an early study of children and adults with and without respiratory illness significant rises in antibody titer accompanied respiratory infection in the nonhospitalized children prevalence of antibody was determined by cf and like the situation in some studies in the north temperate zone children had little antibody whereas 26  of adults were antibody positive 37 later investigations have confirmed the worldwide distribution of these agents 112 114 in particular the widespread use of pcr has now allowed easy documentation of the activity of all the coronaviruses in fact one of the four viruses now recognized hku1 was first identified in the subtropical city of hong kong 20 these findings suggest that coronaviruses are worldwide in distribution and cause similar types of illness in different localities 115 as has been noted with many other respiratory viruses 116 117 the newly recognized human mers coronavirus infections have only occurred in middle eastern countries jordan qatar saudi arabia the united arab emirates with limited secondary transmission being reported in france italy tunisia and the united kingdom the infection is probably of zoonotic origin although other scenarios cannot be completely excluded at present persons with immunosuppressive conditions and other underlying diseases appear to be particularly susceptible to infection while there have been significant clusters of infection in some health-care facilities mers coronavirus appears to have limited capacity for human-to-human spread at present 118120 because most illnesses caused by coronaviruses are similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses it is impossible to identify epidemic behavior of the viruses clinically in early epidemiologic studies there was however evidence of variation in the frequency of infection on both a seasonal and a cyclical basis in these investigations isolation and rises in antibody titer for all types of coronaviruses were rare events outside the period from december through may this is the portion of the year in which isolation rates for rhinoviruses often reach their lowest level an exception to this rule was a study in which frequent rises in titer were detected by elisa in summer as well 84 more recent studies identifying the viruses by pcr have largely confirmed the winter seasonality of the viruses in the north temperate zone one study observed that the timing of coronavirus identifications was similar to that of influenza in winterearly spring 22 as expected the seasonality appears to differ in places like hong kong based on accumulating data 121 in the earlier multiyear population-based studies a cyclical pattern could also be seen in the occurrence of individual virus types in fig 104 data are summarized from five longitudinal studies of coronavirus activity carried out in different parts of the united states in all studies some sporadic activity did occur in nearly all years studied but rises in antibody titers were concentrated in certain years in which they far exceeded the means for the entire studies those periods are indicated as solid black boxes in the figure the times during which specimens were collected in each investigation are indicated in the figure by the white boxes activity of 229e was detected in all four studies at the same time even though two were in the midwest and two in the eastern united states it seems possible on the basis of these data to postulate a 2- to 3-year cycle for this agent the greatest number of infections in chicago was seen in 1967 after the absence of the agent for 3 years that pattern suggests a role of herd immunity in determining the time of reappearance of the agent

 with oc43 the situation is quite different as with 229e in no investigation did 2 years with high rates of infection or illness follow one another a possible exception was in the tecumseh study however the agent that caused the rises in titer in 19671968 did not appear as closely related serologically to oc43 as the agent involved in the other two outbreaks this observation indicates a problem in identifying cycling of oc43 using the serological test employed more recent studies using pcr have mainly not been population based or have focused on a limited number of the four known respiratory coronaviruses so that comparable observations across all of the viruses are not possible however it is possible to conclude that in any winter season all four viruses may be identified in a single geographic area 122 123 there are likely to be increases of one or more in specific years but it is unlikely that any coronavirus disappears completely this is somewhat similar to our growing realization with better surveillance of the long-term occurrence of influenza types and subtypes 22 there is little available evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses behave differently than other respiratory viruses infections are most common in children and decrease with increasing age however it is unclear whether the drop-off is modest or more extreme as is the case with respiratory syncytial virus 124 in the tecumseh study a total population group was followed during the 19681969 oc43 outbreak infection rates were relatively uniform for all age groups varying from a high of 292 per 100 person-years in the 04 age group to 222 in those over 40 years of age 32 the reversal of the pattern of age-specific infection rates customarily associated with the respiratory viruses becomes complete with 229e infection with this virus has been more difficult to demonstrate in small children than in adults in tecumseh during the 19661967 outbreak highest age-specific infection rates by cf were found among those 1529 years of age following a steady increase in infection frequency from the 0- to 4-year-olds however when neutralization tests were used to detect infection the 15- to 19-year-olds still had high infection rates but the serial increase to that point among younger age groups was much less steep 31 this suggests that the apparent sparing of small children with 229e may be an artifact resulting from the relative insensitivity of the young to the serological procedures commonly employed it would be surprising if two different coronavirus serotypes behaved so differently 125 there is little evidence for or against a sex differential in infections with the coronaviruses in tecumseh adult females experienced higher infection rates with oc43 than adult males which is in conformity with the usual patterns of all respiratory illnesses 126 similarly female volunteers appeared to be more susceptible to infection with 229e-like strains than males in artificial challenge studies 127 in the study by candeias et al of antibody prevalence the results were examined by sex but no significant differences could be observed 43 there are no data available on occupational or racial susceptibility to infection or on the role of socioeconomic status in influencing rates occurrence of infection in closed or special populations such as military recruits or residents of childrens institutions has been reported 5 26 34 the role of the school-age child in dissemination of coronavirus has not yet been clearly defined but it would be surprising if these infections differed in their transmission pattern so markedly from that documented with the other agents because of the high frequency of infection in older children and adults other sites of dissemination may also be of significance it has been possible to show that the family unit is of importance in transmission since clustering of 229e and oc43 infections in families was observed in the tecumseh and seattle studies 31 128 although nutritional and genetic factors have not been associated with susceptibility to coronavirus infections there are clear indications that the viruses are associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive respiratory disease such a finding is hardly surprising in view of the high infection rates that have been observed in unselected older adults 129 it has not yet been demonstrated whether this represents true increased susceptibility to infection or simply a more severe form of expression of the infection when it occurs in an already compromised host in addition to the situation in older individuals there is evidence that both oc43 and 229e may trigger acute attacks of wheezing in young asthmatics in fact in one study coronaviruses were the most common agent involved in episodes of wheezy bronchitis 21 33 117 130 recent studies using the pcr technique also associate the viruses with illnesses including pneumonia in immunocompromised patients 63 115 131 one study identified all the viruses over the course of a year but the newer viruses nl63 and hku1 most commonly again this may be a reflection of these viruses being most common at that point in time it should be noted that shortly after the first identification of nl63 in one city in the netherlands it was again identified in another which may indicate increased circulation at the time 18 132 in total 8096 probable sars cases were reported to the world health organization by august 2003 138 the most affected areas were hong kong with 1755 probable cases among a population of 68 million and mainland china with 5327 probable cases among a population of 13 billion taiwan canada and singapore also experienced notable epidemics with 346 251 and 238 probable cases respectively while altogether cases were reported in more than 25 different countries and administrative regions reported cases of sars globally and in hong kong by time of symptom onset are shown in fig 105

 a common feature of sars outbreaks in different regions was the central role of hospitals and transmission among patients and health-care workers 139143 a peak in infectiousness was thought to occur around 10 days after illness onset 144 by which time cases would have been hospitalized and certain medical procedures were particularly prone to generating transmission 145 hospital transmission played a prominent role in the initial epidemic in hong kong with more than 250 cases attributed to an outbreak at the prince of wales hospital in early march 2003 146 147 the canadian outbreak began when a case returning from hong kong was admitted to hospital and 72  of cases were subsequently attributed to nosocomial transmission 143 148 old age and the presence of comorbidities including diabetes mellitus hypertension coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased the risk of death or adverse outcomes such as admission to an icu requiring mechanical ventilation and development of ards 149 150 sex male high lactate dehydrogenase concentration at presentation and higher sars-cov viral load have been found contributing to higher case fatality rate as well 151 genetic factors may contribute to host susceptibility to sars infection 78 152 153 to date there have been no studies on the relationship of race socioeconomic status occupation or nutrition to susceptibility to sars infection concerted efforts were made during the sars epidemic to determine the transmission dynamics and thereby support control 154 155 contact tracing exercises provided information to estimate the incubation period at around 5 days with around 95  of infections leading to illness onset within 1014 days 156158 early in the epidemic delays between illness onset and admission to hospital were typically 57 days and a measure of the success of public health control measures was the reduction in onset-admission intervals to just 12 days by the end of the epidemic 150 157 on average patients remained in hospital for around 34 weeks 157 the basic reproductive number r0 an estimate of the average number of secondary cases resulting from one infected case in a completely susceptible population was estimated to be in the range 23 154 155 159 the average time between successive cases was around 84 days 155 due to these features taken together in the early stages of outbreaks the number of cases approximately doubled every week one issue of early controversy was the case fatality risk early in the epidemic technical errors led to underestimation 160 for example on march 25 the world health organization reported the case fatality risk to be around 4  based on 49 deaths among more than 1000 cases at that time 161 this estimate was erroneously low because cases had not yet recovered and some cases would subsequently succumb to the disease 160 after the epidemic the case fatality risk was estimated to be 96  with 744 deaths among the 8096 probable cases 135 however this masks substantial variability between affected regions from around 7  in beijing to around 17  in hong kong 150 reasons for variation remain unclear but could partly be attributed to case definitions partly to case mix including age and underlying heath conditions 150 and partly to case management 162 few cases are thought to have been asymptomatic or subclinical serological studies were conducted in various groups including health-care workers close contacts of cases other patients and the general community in affected regions and a review of these studies found that the average seropositivity rate was just 01  among more than 20000 individuals 163 despite a basic reproductive number in the range 23 higher than influenza the global epidemic of sars was effectively controlled by appropriate nosocomial infection control measures a range of interventions contributed to containment 164 including the use of engineering controls such as negative-pressure isolation rooms 143 improved adherence to the use of personal protective equipment such as gowns gloves and masks 165 as well as administrative measures including patient triaging and isolation visitor restrictions and establishment of dedicated sars teams of staff 166 the importance of strict infection control was illustrated particularly well by the experiences in taiwan and toronto where control of the initial outbreaks was followed by complacency and subsequent second waves 167 168 despite the importance of infection control strategies there are also examples of individuals with sars who were hospitalized where infection control practices were lax and yet their infection did not result in outbreaks 169 patient factors may also have had a role in the risk of transmission 170 the four endemic respiratory coronaviruses are presumably transmitted by the respiratory route it has been possible to induce infection experimentally in volunteers by inoculating virus into the nose 35 44 the virus is most stable at ph 60 and low temperature appears to protect it against varied relative humidity 171 172 no other route of transmission for coronaviruses seems involved in man although animal coronaviruses are infectious by the fecaloral route 57 there is currently no direct evidence to aid in identifying the main mechanisms of transmission however it is possible to compare the epidemiologic behavior of the coronaviruses with that of other respiratory agents the transmission mechanisms of which have been more directly studied large-scale outbreaks of coronavirus infections have taken place as in tecumseh in 1967 31 this is much more analogous to the situation seen with influenza than to that with the rhinoviruses 173 rhinoviruses are thought to be transmitted by large droplet and may at times spread via fomites 174 unlike the situation with the sars coronaviruses there is no evidence that any animal reservoir or vector is involved in the maintenance of infection or transmission of the other respiratory human coronaviruses there has been a report of antibody to avian ibv in the sera of poultry workers but not of controls but no evidence of any further transmission 40 the sars coronavirus was thought to spread through a number of different modes most commonly via direct close contact health-care workers involved in direct patient care duties often had the highest attack rates 175 176 while contact precautions were effective in preventing transmission 165 sars coronavirus was capable of surviving on dried inert surfaces and was found on some hospital surfaces 177 and indirect contact was implied in the infections of some nonmedical staff 178 although there is substantial evidence to support the role of transmission through droplet and direct contact and some evidence to support transmission by indirect contact there is relatively little evidence for airborne transmission 179 in one large community outbreak in hong kong a computational fluid dynamics model was used to demonstrate that airborne transmission was consistent with the observed pattern of infections 180 although this hypothesis was not formally compared with other possible explanations however lacking other evidence of airborne transmission despite unprotected extended exposures in health-care settings 169 181 182 the world health organization classified sars as a disease with opportunistic airborne transmission to indicate that the disease naturally spreads by non-airborne routes but under special environmental conditions may spread by the airborne route 183 184 diseases that are spread by opportunistic airborne transmission do not require special airborne infection isolation measures for example negative-pressure isolation rooms but special precautions are recommended for high-risk procedures data that demonstrate the etiologic role of coronaviruses in respiratory infections are derived from laboratory and field studies coronaviruses interfere with the action of cilia in tracheal organ culture which suggests that they could have the same effect in vivo epidemiologic studies also have demonstrated association of 229e infection with disease during the 1967 outbreak of 229e infection in tecumseh michigan illness was significantly more common among those with infection than among matched subjects without infection 31 similarly 229e infection among chicago medical students was statistically associated with illness when those with rises in titer were used as their own controls 25 furthermore experimental inoculation of volunteers with strains of 229e and oc43 isolated in the laboratory has resulted in clinical illness fulfilling kochs postulates modified by rivers 185 for attributing an etiologic role to a microbe as a cause of disease 35 36 47 sars-cov has also fulfilled the kochrivers postulates for association with the disease of sars the virus was detected in patients with sars but not in those without disease and the virus was detected at the site of the pathology that is lung 51 the virus was isolated in pure culture from the lung biopsy of a patient with sars and experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with this virus produced a comparable disease a specific immune response to the virus was demonstrated and the virus was successfully re-isolated from the site of pathology in the infected animal 186 fulfilling kochrivers postulates for more recently discovered human coronaviruses has been more challenging because of the lack of suitable animal models that recapitulate the disease in humans 187 and their etiologic association with disease lies largely on epidemiologic grounds an important characteristic of the respiratory coronaviruses is their apparent high rate of reinfection which in volunteers has now been documented to be possible within a year of prior infection 188 in the tecumseh study 815  of those infected with oc43 actually possessed prior n antibody 189 possession of circulating oc43 hi antibody among the atlanta children did not appear to play a role in modifying severity of a subsequent illness 28 with 229e virus hamre and beem 25 demonstrated that the frequency of rise in titer detected by n was inversely proportional to preinfection levels of n antibody which would indicate that this antibody exerted some protective effect however the importance of this n antibody could not be confirmed when infection was detected by cf thus circulating n antibody as measured at present may bear a relationship to modification of infection but this association is not a very strong one since coronavirus infections involve mainly the surface of the respiratory tract it is likely that secretory iga antibody plays a more direct role in protection this had in fact been demonstrated with a swine coronavirus 190 and subsequently with 229e in humans experimentally infected 191 interaction between coronavirus spike proteins and host cell receptors determines specifically the host range tissue tropism and pathogenesis 192 coronaviruses have a wide spectrum of susceptible host cell range determined by the expression of the relevant receptors table 103 related coronaviruses may use the same or similar receptors for entry and major receptors for hcovs include aminopeptidase apn and ace2 most alphacoronaviruses bind to apn with the exception of nl63 and sars-cov which binds to ace2 some of the betacoronaviruses including oc43 attach to 4- or 9-o-acetylated sialic acids via the virus s and he proteins the he protein also has enzymatic activity to cleave sialic acid linkages and thus serves to release virus from infected cells after replication is completed some human coronaviruses have other binding receptors that allow virus attachment to host cells but these are not sufficient as functional receptors to mediate viral entry by themselves these include calcium-dependent c-type lectins such as l-sign liverlymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin which may serve as a receptor for 229e and sars 202 203 recognition of a receptor from the same family in another host species is possible and may allow cross-species transmission for example 229e can use either human or feline apn but not porcine apn 201 and human and palm civet ace2 serve as receptors for epidemic strains of sars-cov but mouse and rat ace2 do not 204 205
 the receptor for mers coronavirus has been identified to be dpp4 also known as cd26 a protein that is widely conserved across mammalian species and found on the surface of several cell types including the human upper airways as with apn and ace2 dpp4 is an ectopeptidase that cleaves amino acids from biologically active peptides 200 the human coronavirus oc43 and bovine coronaviruses share close genetic similarity suggesting that they arose from a common ancestor less than 150 years ago 206 coronaviruses can undergo dramatic changes in tissue tropism and virulence within the same host for example porcine enteric transmissible gastroenteritis virus caused a severe enteric disease in pigs a spontaneously occurring genetic mutation deletion occurring in the spike gene led to a change in virulence and was associated with a switch of virus tropism from the gastrointestinal tract to the respiratory tract 207 there is limited data on the pathology of coronaviruses other than sars-cov because these infections are generally mild electron micrographic changes from the nasal mucosa of a child with a coronavirus infection showed minimal pathological changes 208 although the clinically major pathology of sars was that seen in the respiratory tract sars-cov caused a disseminated infection with virus being found in the feces urine and plasma or serum 209 early disease was associated with desquamation of the alveolar epithelium and disseminated alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation in the alveolar spaces viral antigen was demonstrated in alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages 210 in intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with sars virus infection of intestinal epithelium was demonstrated by electron microscopy with minimal cytopathic effect which is consistent with the watery diarrhea seen in these patients 211 high serum levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines cxcl10 il-8 and cytokines il-1 and il-6 suggested a role for immunopathology although it is uncertain whether these inflammatory responses are causally relevant or an epiphenomenon in the pathogenesis 212 the incubation period of coronavirus colds is relatively short in studies involving volunteers the mean period from inoculation of virus to development of symptoms was from 32 to 35 days depending on the strain range 24 days 35 44 following exposure the virus apparently multiplies superficially in the respiratory tract in a manner similar to that in which multiplication occurs in vitro nasal airway resistance and temperature of the nasal mucosa increase 213 virus excretion usually reaches a detectable level at the time symptoms begin and lasts for 14 days the duration of the illness is from 6 to 7 days on the average but with some lasting up to 18 days serological response either to induced or to naturally acquired infection has been quite variable depending on the infecting strain and the serological test employed for example among those experimentally infected with oc38 or oc43 virus who had a cold produced only 46  had rises in titer by hi and 23  by cf fewer than half of those infected with 229e showed a cf rise it is not clear how the existence of titer or preinfection antibody affects the magnitude of the response detected by these tests rises in n antibody titer are easier to detect and have been found with sensitive techniques in all volunteers experimentally infected 36 92 the use of the elisa test has given added sensitivity in antibody detection it is not as yet clear if decreased specificity should be a concern the respiratory coronaviruses cause cold-like illness that on an individual basis is difficult to distinguish from illness caused by other respiratory viruses they have also been reported to cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory infections such as croup and bronchiolitis 115 123 214 most of the evidence of their involvement in severe disease comes from reports from hospitals of the identification of the viruses by pcr it is thus impossible to say what proportion of infections which appear to be common that result in hospitalization are in fact caused by these viruses another problem recently encountered is the frequent identification by pcr of other viruses in those in whom a coronavirus is found 22 this complicates determining the primary etiology in induced infections in volunteers the most prominent findings have been coryza and nasal discharge with the discharge being more profuse than that customarily seen with rhinovirus colds 35 sore throat has been somewhat less common and in children has been associated with pharyngeal injection 215 experimental colds caused by b814 virus were about as severe as those caused by 229e however natural oc43 infections caused illnesses with considerably more cough and sore throat than did 229e infections 216 the mean duration of coronavirus colds at 65 days was shorter than that seen in rhinovirus colds at 95 days 35 clinical disease occurred in no more than 45  of those infected with 229e in tecumseh during the 1967 outbreak 31 in atlanta children oc43 virus produced illness in about 50  of those infected 28 it is likely that with increase in age and concomitant experience with these agents the ratio of clinically apparent to inapparent infection will decrease as with other respiratory agents a continuum of severity of symptoms exists among those in whom infection results in disease and this may also be related to past experience with the viruses the mechanisms that lead to recovery from coronavirus infections have not been well defined in volunteer studies in persons infected with 229e-like strains it is clear that symptomatic reinfection can occur after a period of about 1 year it is not clear whether this is due to waning immunity or antigenic drift immunocompromised patients shed virus for a prolonged period and may sometimes be associated with a fatal outcome the novel mers coronavirus initially presents with fever and myalgia sometimes with gastrointestinal symptoms rapidly progressing to severe viral pneumonia leading to respiratory failure with renal dysfunction observed in some patients virus was detectable in the respiratory tract as well as the stool 119 virus-neutralizing antibodies are those that react with the virus s and where present he protein although some antibodies against the virus m protein can also neutralize the virus in the presence of complement virus-neutralizing antibodies mainly bind to the n-terminal s1 part of the protein which is also the part of the protein that manifests the greatest amino acid sequence variation the removal of glycans from the s protein greatly reduces the binding of neutralizing antibodies antibodies to the s protein have also been associated with enhanced pathogenesis in feline infectious peritonitis virus but such immunopathology has not so far been convincingly demonstrated with human coronaviruses the nucleocapsid protein contributes to cell-mediated immune protection 209 neutralizing antibody responses to sars-cov appear in the second week of illness and peak at around 30 days of illness and antibodies remain detectable for many years the major neutralizing epitope is in the region of the s protein amino acid residues 441700 98 99 209 it is premature at present to think in terms of control of respiratory coronavirus infection by vaccination thus preparation of vaccines using conventional types is impossible the frequency of reinfection observed is so high that control by vaccination may not be practical but it is possible that future studies may allow further characterization of truly protective antibodies work on vaccines for the animal viruses is in progress and these studies may help in understanding issues of protection chemoprophylaxis and related measures may be a more practical approach it has been shown that recombinant -interferon can prevent infections artificially produced in volunteers 217 and other approaches have been under investigation 25 217219 there remains environmental control of infection such efforts have rarely been useful for other respiratory agents but they may be more efficacious if a practical barrier to transmission can be devised 220 the situation is quite different in terms of the sars-cov because of the severity of the disease produced here the work on vaccines moved forward in the years immediately after 2003 some of this activity of specific vaccine development continues but at a slower pace even when human cases were occurring it was unclear how such a vaccine if available should be used given the distribution of infection and occurrence of clinical disease with disappearance of human cases it has become even more difficult to decide on the appropriate vaccine target populations except for those who might be exposed in a laboratory setting during the sars episode as no virus-specific antiviral agent was available a variety of treatments were used including the broad-acting antiviral agents ribavirin and interferon as well as corticosteroids because of the severity of the disease many were used in combination and it was difficult to say retrospectively whether any individually or in combination had a positive effect 162 corticosteroid therapy was associated with both short-term secondary infections increased viral load and long-term osteoporosis avascular necrosis adverse effects 221 the major problem in working with the respiratory coronaviruses has been solved with the development of rt-pcr previously because of the difficulty in growing them in cell culture epidemiologic and clinical studies had to rely on serology while less limiting in epidemiologic studies where regular blood collections can be scheduled it sharply constrained the ability to identify the role of hcovs in causing severe respiratory infections now we recognize the existence of four different coronaviruses and there may be more that have not yet been identified paradoxically the situation has now been reversed there are many reports on the involvement of these agents in hospitalized cases but epidemiologic studies involving all four hcovs in different populations over time have been relatively scarce it was previously thought that the viruses cycle in their appearance over a period of years but recent evidence is lacking especially pertaining to the newly identified viruses nl63 and hku1 however there are still data suggesting that in the temperate zones the viruses are most active in late winterspring ironically with the pcr technique it has become common to identify more than one virus from the same individual this is not limited to the coronaviruses but includes many other respiratory viruses as well there is a need to determine whether these are true coinfections or whether there may be asymptomatic or prolonged carriage involved if they are real coinfections there may be consequences of having more than one agent present during an illness the sars-cov emerged from a zoonotic reservoir and spread worldwide in a short period of time we still do not know how and why this happened and therefore we must be concerned that such an event could occur again we do not have either vaccines or antivirals for the sars-cov the need is probably greater for antivirals given the severity of the illness and the question of how a vaccine would be used in the current situation the recent identification of a novel coronavirus gives increased urgency to this need it is likely that an anticoronavirus drug would be of use whatever the particular type involved overall the epidemiologic lesson to be learned from sars is the need for good surveillance at the animalhuman interface the virus was probably transmitting locally from human to human for months before it escaped to the rest of the world if this had been recognized there could have been earlier efforts to contain spread which was effectively accomplished later but only after much damage had been done the emergence of a novel mers coronavirus with potential to cause severe human disease though so far originating in the middle east and manifesting limited human-to-human transmission including transmission within health-care facilities is reminiscent of the emergence of sars and is a concern for global public health 120 the numbers of laboratory-confirmed patients with mers continues to increase with 837 laboratory confirmed cases and 291 deaths being reported to who as of 23 july 2014 the median age of all cases is 52 years but primary human cases those who have no exposure to other confirmed cases are older median age 58 years compared to secondary cases median age 45 years the majority of confirmed cases have underlying health conditions all cases so far have a link to the middle east with primary human infections reported from jordan kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates cases reported from outside the middle east have either a history of travel to the middle east or exposure to a patient who acquired infection from that region clusters of human cases and evidence of limited human-to-human transmission have been reported to date more than half of the secondary cases have been associated with health care settings including health care workers health care workers appear to have less severe disease in general although deaths have occasionally been reported 222 mers coronavirus mers-cov has been detected in nasal swabs of apparently healthy dromedary camels and adult animals from the middle east and africa have high rates of sero-positivity 223 224 in some cases infection of dromedary camel herds has preceded disease in humans in close contact with such animals 225 however in a large number of human cases there appears to be no record of a history of contact with camels the dromedary mers-cov virus appears genetically identical to those infecting humans but abattoir workers with repeated exposure to potentially infected animals have little serological evidence of infection 223 the geographic distribution of mers-cov infection in camels including north east africa is wider than that reported in primary human cases reported so far it remains to be seen whether this represents under-recognition of human cases in a wider geographic area mers-cov antibodies have been detected in archived dromedary sera collected over two decades ago 226 and this may indicate that mers is a recently recognised rather than a newly emerging disease however the possibility of a recent virus mutation that increased the risk of transmission to humans cannot be ruled out no specific validated therapeutic options or vaccines are available so far  evaluating covid-19 screening strategies based on serological tests michela baccini alessandra mattei emilia rocco giulia vannucci fabrizia mealli  facing the sars-cov-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects although rt-pcr is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies we analyze the performance of a screening strategy proposed in tuscany italy which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection and then rt-pcr tests on the positive subjects methods we simulate the number of rt-pcr tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500000 subjects under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 050 to 080 specificity098 a compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening under different values of the infection reproduction number results assuming a sensitivity equal to 080 and a prevalence of 03 the screening procedure would require on average 111676 rt-pcr tests and would produce 300 false negatives responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1132 under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 05 to 1 costs and false negatives increase with the prevalence conclusions the analyzed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low the cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic accounting for the fact that it may change over time  the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 epidemic has rapidly spread around the world most european countries have implemented progressive measures of physical distancing in italy from march 9 th  citizens were prohibited from leaving home except in cases of proven need or urgency since may 4 th  the restrictions has been progressively lifted on during this post lockdown period scientists have advocated the need of implementing 3t-strategies ie tracing testing treatment in order to minimize the chance of a new spread of the disease and intercept as many infected individuals as possible 1  the who has stressed that more intensive testing of suspected cases are required to identify and early quarantined infected people 2  knowledge of diagnostic tests for sars-cov-2 is still evolving and a clear understanding of the nature of the tests and interpretation of their findings is not yet there the most reliable diagnostic test for sars-cov-2 is the infections-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test although evidence arose that its accuracy could be not maximum 3 4 5 6  a wide range of serology immunoassays ias have been developed as well 7 8  these include automated chemiluminescent ia clia manual elisa and rapid lateral flow ia lfia which detect the immunoglobulin m igm and immunoglobulin g igg produced in persons in response to sars-cov-2 infection due to the limited availability of reagents for rt-pcr tests and the relative low cost of the serological test different countries and regions have proposed the use of ias in combination with rt-pcr in heterogeneous screening strategies to detect subjects with ongoing infection despite serological tests are not appropriate to reveal the presence of viral material during the infection in fact while they are useful to investigate the extent of the contagion in the community by detecting individuals who have developed antibodies ias may lead to high false negative and false positive rates if used with the intent of identifying subjects with ongoing infection for reasons related to the sars-cov-2 antibody dynamics 6 7 9 10  in this paper we analyze one such screening strategy that has been proposed by the governor of tuscany italy with decree n54 of may 6 th 2020 11  this strategy similar to others implemented elsewhere uses first qualitative serological rapid tests and then rt-pcr tests in case of positive immune response the strategy is going to be applied to a large portion of the regional population half a million people approximately 18 of the whole population under different scenarios of prevalence of infection we assess the performance of this screening strategy in terms of expected number of rt-pcr tests to be used on infected and uninfected subjects as well as in terms of number of infected individuals that the procedure will not be able to detect in order to contextualize the danger derived from the infected subjects left undetected we quantify the potential contagion deriving from these false negatives under different hypotheses on the infection reproduction number r0 that is the average number of contagions deriving from one infected individual 12 13  rapid point-of-care tests for detection of antibodies have been widely developed and marketed and are of variable quality these tests are purely qualitative in nature and indicate the presence or absence of sars-cov-2 antibodies a positive result may arise in case of 1 previous infection high igg titer 2 infection in action presence of both igm and igg 3 none of the first two false detection of antibodies a negative test may arise in case of 1 early stage of an infection 2 no previous infection 3 false detection of absence of antibodies 7 14  serological tests generally have a relatively high sensitivity as tests for detecting the presence of antibodies igg and igm 8  however due to reasons related to antibodies kinetics infected individuals need some time to develop antibodies and thus serological tests wrongly report a negative result on infected individuals who have not developed antibodies yet 6  therefore serological tests are powerful diagnosis tools for asymptomatic patients or patients with mild to moderate illness who undergo the test after two weeks from the illness onset but may perform poorly if used as screening tests for detecting ongoing infections 8  the sensitivity of the serological test when used to detect ongoing infections can be decomposed in the following way      2   2      2    2    where   the serological test is positive o  the subject has ongoing infection 2w  the test is performed during the first two weeks from infection onset let us assume that the probability that the serological test is positive in subjects that develop antibodies is at its maximum   2    1 and that the time from infection onset to recovery is estimated as 4-6 weeks so that 2   lies between 05 and 033 15  under this assumptions if the probability of a positive serological test during the first two weeks of infection is equal to zero   2   0 then   ranges from 05 to 067 if more optimistically   2  is greater than zero let say 030 then   ranges from 065 to 077 it should be noticed that assuming   2    1 we get an optimistic range for the sensitivity   regarding specificity first note that each subject in the population belongs to one of the following disjoint groups o  subjects who have ongoing infection   subjects who have never been infected and   subjects who have been infected in the past but do not have an ongoing infection therefore the event   indicating that the subject does not have an ongoing infection is equal to     and the event  indicating that the subject has been infected is equal to    let -denote the event that the serological test is negative then we can write the specificity of the serological test when used to detect ongoing infections as follows under the assumption that the serological test is perfectly able to detect antibodies unless it is performed within the 2 weeks window after the contagion ie           0 the previous equation becomes where    is the specificity of the serological test if used to detect antibodies considering that    is very high -approximately 1 for some serological tests 8 16 17 -and that in the actual epidemic scenario being is expected to be not lower than 098 12  in our analysis we set    to 098 we evaluate the performance of the screening strategy in a monte carlo simulation study on pseudo-populations of 500000 subjects characterized by different percentage of individuals with ongoing infection we consider the following prevalence values 0003 0005 0010 0015 002 the first three scenarios are in accordance with studies reporting proportions of infected peoples around 03 and never greater than 1 over the last four months of the coronavirus pandemic 12 18  the last two correspond to scenarios where the level of contagion is worse than the one expected in the general population according to the results obtained in the previous section we first focus on an optimistic scenario where sensitivity 080 and specificity098 then taking 080 as an upper bound of the sensitivity level we also perform simulations with sensitivity equal to 05 06 and 07 for sake of simplicity we assume that the rt-pcr test has specificity and sensitivity equal to 1 even if a certain percentage of false negatives is expected from this procedure as well 4 5  under this assumption the sensitivity and specificity of the serological test can be interpreted as relative to the rt-pcr test for each simulation setting we run 500 monte carlo mc iterations and in each iteration we calculate various performance measures of the strategy total number of rt-pcr tests number of rt-pcr tests respectively performed on infected and uninfected individuals number of false negatives and negative predictive value it is worth noting that due to the fact that false and true positives from the serological test undergo a rt-pcr test the screening protocol does not produce false positives the specificity of the strategy is 1 by design thus the positive predictive value is 1 starting from the estimated numbers of false negatives arising from the monte carlo simulations we use a susceptible-infected-recovered sir compartmental model to predict the number of infected originated by those that the screening left undetected assuming a time from infection to exit death or recovery equal to three weeks 15 19  we calculate both the number of circulating subjects with ongoing infection assuming that all subjects in the population are screened at the same time and the cumulative number of new infections two months after the screening derived from the undetected infected subjects calculations are done under the different prevalence scenarios used in the mc simulations and different hypothetical values of the infection reproduction number r0 05 1 15 2 in relative terms the strategy appears to perform well the negative predictive values are very high with a mc mean always close to 1 and a very low variability as described by the 5 and 95 mc percentiles see figure 4  however the actual impact can be better understood by looking at the absolute values the total number of rt-pcr tests performed at the second step of the screening procedure and the number of false negatives figure 1 shows the mc average number of rt-pcr tests total number of rt-pcr tests on infected and uninfected individuals and the average number of false negatives in addition to the mc mean table 1 shows the mc 5 th and 95 th percentile of these quantities for instance consider a population where the prevalence is 03 and the specificity and sensitivity of the serological test are respectively 098 and 080 first bar in figure 1 and first row in table 1  two important findings are noted first a large number of rt-pcr tests is performed on uninfected individuals the screening strategy requires that in addition to the 500000 serological tests about 11168 rt-pcr tests are administered 9968 of which undergone on uninfected people that is on false positive people to the serological test only the remaining 1200 tests reveals the presence of the infection second the screening strategy leads to 300 false negatives ie the serological test is not able to detect the presence of antibodies in 300 infected individuals possibly because done within two weeks from the onset of the infection no test will be performed on these infected individuals who therefore will not be kept in quarantine  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

medrxiv preprint as the prevalence increases  figure 1 and table 1  the number of false negatives increases too on the other hand the number of rt-pcr tests performed on the false positives slightly decreases leaving the specificity of the serological test unchanged figure 2 reports the expected number of false negatives as the sensitivity varies for different values of prevalence the results of the sird model are reported in table 2 and figure 3  for this analysis we assume a sensitivity of the test equal to 080 and a specificity equal to 098 in figure 3 we report the daily number of infected derived from the false negatives who is expected to be present in the region during the first month after the screening the number of infected subjects decreases over time if the reproduction number r0 is lower than 1 is stable if r0 is exactly 1 and increases if r0 is higher than 1 the induced epidemic strongly depends on the initial number of false negatives and thus on the prevalence of infection at the time of the screening the total number of new infections attributable to the false negatives after two months from the screening is reported in table 2  if r0 is lower than 05 and the prevalence is lower than 1 the new infected attributable to the original false negatives are less than 1800 but a values of r0 equal to 1 is sufficient to double the burden of infection originated from the undetected infected individuals if the reproduction number is equal to 2 the new infections are expected to be more than 8000 even for very low values of the initial prevalence our results provide important insights on the cost-effectiveness of the analyzed strategy first of all in a time of scarce availability of reagents for rt-pcr analysis it should be carefully evaluated whether it is feasible to perform such a large number of rt-pcr tests on subjects resulted positive to the rapid serological test by also considering that most of these positives are false positives the fact that as described in the decree 11 serological tests will be carried out on a voluntary basis further undermines the performance of the strategy alternative less laborious and less costly screening procedures and strategies that improve the accuracy of the serological tests should be evaluated for instance in order to increase the positive predictive value of the serological test a questionnaire collecting information on sars-cov-2 symptoms could be firstly administered and individuals with sars-cov-2 symptoms encouraged to undergo the test additionally with the aim to reduce the costs related to the rt-pcr tests performed at the second step of the screening procedure individuals with a positive serological result might be preventively quarantined and undergone a second serological test after a pre-fixed time period defined on the basis of sars-cov-2 antibodies kinetics in this case social and economic costs deriving from the preventive quarantine should be quantified as well from an efficacy perspective our results show that the main pitfall of the strategy is the number of undetected infected people which increases as the prevalence of subjects with ongoing infection in the population increases false negatives could cause false reassurance behavioral changes and disease spread it is also important that the number of false negatives is evaluated in the context of the epidemic in fact each undetected case can generate other infected individuals and the transmission can happen with different strength depending on many factors mainly related to the implementation of measures of physical distancing and plans aimed to early detect and isolate new cases in our simplified sir model 13  we change r0 to define different scenarios of transmission showing that the same number of initial undetected infected individuals can be responsible of very different numbers of new infected individuals after two months from the screening in particular strategies like the one analyzed in this paper might be particularly ineffectiveness in the long-run when with the progressive time from the lockdown an increase of r0 is expected or when applied to sub-populations where the number of potential at risk contacts is higher than among the general  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

be also considered that the relative gain of applying this two-step screening procedure in respect to testing all subjects through individual rt-pcr tests decreases with the prevalence and that as the prevalence increases the number of false negatives increases as well thus this kind of procedure should absolutely be avoided unless the prevalence is very low in the context of the sars-cov-2 pandemic evaluation procedures such as that one used in this paper should be routinely performed before any implementation of new screening strategies on the general population or on specific subpopulations particularly in the presence of resources constraints unlike in the case of non-communicable diseases the danger deriving from cases that are not detected by the screening should be contextualized accounting for the strength of the epidemic spread which depends not only on the social distancing measures adopted to slow the contagion but also on the measures undertaken for early detection and isolation of the subjects with ongoing infection thus ultimately on the effectiveness of the screening strategies themselves  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

clinical characteristics running head molecular and serological assays for sars-cov-2 jiping shi dongsheng han runling zhang jinming li rui zhang  the ongoing outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has posed a challenge for worldwide public health a reliable laboratory assay is essential both to confirm suspected patients and to exclude patients infected with other respiratory viruses thereby facilitating the control of global outbreak scenarios in this review we focus on the genomic transmission and clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for sars-cov-2 we also explore the quality assurance measures for these assays summary sars-cov-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects including the design of primers the selection of specimens and testing strategies at different disease stages appropriate quality assurance measures for molecular and serological assays are needed to maintain testing proficiency because serological assays have the potential to identify later stages of the infection and to confirm highly suspected cases with negative molecular assay results a combination of these two assays is needed to achieve a reliable capacity to detect sars-cov-2  the emergence of pathogenic coronaviruses has been a global public health challenge in recent years on january 7 2020 the china centers for disease control and prevention cdc officially announced the outbreak of a novel pneumonia caused by a pathogenic coronavirus in wuhan china subsequently this novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and its associated clinical syndrome was named corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 1 sars-cov-2 is wreaking havoc in 215 countries yielding a total of more than 4000000 confirmed cases and 250000 deaths throughout the world 2  and has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who 3 4  the ability to reliably diagnose sars-cov-2 would facilitate the identification of infected patients and the therapy of covid-19 5  so development of a reliable assay has been one of the foremost matters for public health and clinical interventions nucleic acid assays by reverse transcription real-time pcr rt-pcr are the main approach to diagnose infections and repeated serological antibody testing over time represents another valuable approach for molecular and serological assays the design of reagents selection of specimens and detection strategies in different stages are determined by the characteristics of sars-cov-2 therefore elucidating the unique regions in the genome as well as the specific transmission and clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 is key to detection negative assay results with some current molecular assays seen in clinical cases highly suspected of covid-19 have lessened the clinical acceptance of these assays in favor of radiologic assays in some cases 6  the reasons for negative results in such cases may involve low viral loads in specimens and unverified reagents and inadequate testing operations so the quality assurance of reagents and testing is indispensable consequently a thorough examination of the characteristics of the virus recent assays and related quality assurance measures is needed and should help facilitate the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 in this review we first focus on the current knowledge regarding the genomic transmission and clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 and summarize insights gained from these characteristics for the development of molecular and serological assays as some testing reagents have been approved for immediate use without substantial clinical validation we also analyzed quality assurance measures needed for these assays to assure the accuracy of results we believe that a comprehensive summary of the assays and quality assurance systems is important for virus detection thereby facilitating better control of the epidemic sars-cov-2 is a linear single-stranded positive-sense rna virus and the whole viral genome is approximately 29903 nt genbank mn9089473 in length 7 8  the fig 1a  the orf regions which account for approximately 23 of the genome 6 encode nonstructural proteins 10  these nonstructural proteins can be cleaved by viral 3c-like protease and papain-like protease to form viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase hel which guide viral genome replication transcription and translation 11  the 3-end of the genome encodes four structural proteins including spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins as well as accessory proteins 12 fig 1b  notably as a positive-stranded rna virus sars-cov-2 has a high mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading activity of polymerases 13  the homology and differences in genome between sars-cov-2 and other batrelated viruses are pivotal for laboratory assays sequencing of the genomes of these viruses has revealed that sars-cov-2 is closely related to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 with a similarity of 88 14  table 1 14 15  compared with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 the e gene is the most conserved region in sars-cov-2 with a similarity 93 followed by the m and n gene regions the sequence identity of orf1a approximately 90 is greater than that of orf1b approximately 86 notably the s gene exhibits the lowest similarity at approximately 75 table 1  14  phylogenetic analysis indicates that sars-cov-2 clusters with members of the sarbecovirus subtype of betacoronaviruses and the 7 relationships between these pathogenic viruses have been revealed previously 8 14  fig 1c  in summary these sequence similarity studies revealed the genetic differences of sars-cov-2 from other bat-related viruses and can be used to suggest the targeted genes that should be chosen for molecular assays sars-cov-2 likely originated from the chinese horseshoe bat 14  and the initial patients were infected mainly by wild animals 14  while the subsequent cases were infected by these patients 16  sustained human-to-human transmission brought about a global pandemic as is typical of respiratory viruses the main spread routes of sars-cov-2 include intimate contact and respiratory droplets 17  moreover sars-cov-2 has been detected in feces and urine 18 19  indicating the risk of fecal-oral transmission and aerosol or contact propagation caused by excreta pollution 20  the virus is rampant not only in the respiratory system but also in other organs which can be explained by the distribution of virus affinity receptors the interaction of the receptor-binding domain rbd with receptors of host cells involves the s1 and s2 subunits-mediated receptor binding and membrane fusion respectively 21  sars-cov-2 has been proven to enter and infect the host cells as mediated by binding to ace2 receptors  fig 2a 22  ace2 receptors are abundantly expressed in the respiratory system however they are more highly expressed in the lower respiratory tract than in the upper respiratory tract with the expression being the highest in alveolar epithelial cells 23  in addition ace2 receptors are also highly present in the epithelial 8 cells of the oral mucosa tongue small intestine heart and kidney  fig 2b 23 24  therefore sars-cov-2 infects the respiratory system initially and virus replication in alveoli causes alveolar vascular rupture as the disease progresses then the virus may spread throughout the body through blood infecting other organs expressing ace2 receptors 25  after infection of sars-cov-2 the general incubation period is 1 to 14 days usually 3-7 days 26  the main clinical symptoms of infected patients involve fever cough expectoration headache myalgia or fatigue dyspnea diarrhea nausea and vomiting 27  gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in 10 of cases a higher proportion than found in other coronaviruses 28  however some infected patients do not present with typical symptoms and thus represent asymptomatic infections 29  for laboratory testing the viral loads in different stages populations and organs are discrepant in most patients the average days from onset to the early progressive and recovery stages are 4 range 2 -6 12 range 7 -19  and 20 range 10 -33 days respectively 30  the virus rapidly replicates in the first few days 31 reaching a peak approximately 10 4 -10 7 copiesml in the early or progressive stages and then declines with the viral load mostly lower than 10 4 copiesml in the recovery stage fig 3  32 33 34  the total viral shedding time is approximately 20 days 34  therefore the viral load in the early and progressive stages is significantly higher than that in the recovery stage 30  of different populations examined the viral load in elderly patients was reported to be the highest 35  viral rna has been detected most frequently from 9 nasopharyngeal swabs oropharyngeal swabs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf saliva anal swabs and serum specimens 31 36  generally the viral load was 6-fold higher in respiratory tract specimens approximately 43310 4 rna copiesml including nasopharyngeal aspiratesswabs throat swabs saliva and sputum than in non-respiratory specimens approximately 70610 3 rna copiesml including plasma urine and fecesrectal swabs 37  for different specimens from the respiratory tract the viral load detected in sputum was higher than that detected in the nose and throat 30 34  in one study the viral load in sputum was reported to be 75210 5 copiesml approximately 10-fold higher than that of the pharyngeal swab which was 79910 4 copiesml while the load in a nasal swab was 16910 5 copiesml 32  several results of virus detection by rt-pcr were found to be unconvincing in clinical use for instance a child was found to be virus positive based on stool specimens for at least 9 days but the respiratory tract specimens were still negative according to rt-pcr 38  additionally some clinically highly suspected patients had negative results for the virus in oral swabs 39  hence one single nucleic acid test of a single sample may miss an infected patient the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection in clinical laboratories worldwide mainly depends on the detection of the viral nucleic acids by rt-pcr 40  for rt-pcr assays what specific genes are selected as the target region is crucial the e gene of sars-cov-2 has been shown to be highly similar to that of other coronaviruses a fact that 10 can serve as the first-line screening tool 41  in addition sars-cov-2 has low homology with other bat-related viruses in the orf1b involving rdrp n and s genes 10 41 42  which are relatively specific genes worth targeting in clinical rt-pcr protocols single-target and multi-target assays are commonly employed the former refers to the use of one set of primers and related probes to target a single gene region of virus in the rt-pcr system whereas the latter uses multiple sets of primers and their related probes such as reagents targeting the orf1ab and n genes in china and those that target the n gene in thailand 43  since sars-cov-2 is a single-stranded rna that is prone to mutation increasing the number of specific targets in the rt-pcr system will increase the testing sensitivity however if the primers are not specifically designed multiple targets in the pcr system could interfere with each other reducing the amplification efficiency and clinical sensitivity 44  in summary selecting an appropriate number of targets for rt-pcr protocols depends on the detection purpose the specific primer sequence and the results of performance verification currently many rt-pcr protocols for sars-cov-2 have been approved by the us food and drug administration fda emergency use authorizations eua or national medical products administration nmpa or were listed on the who website  table 2  for instance in the rt-pcr protocol for sars-cov-2 developed in germany primers targeting the e gene can screen all bat-related coronaviruses and primers for the rdrp and n genes were specifically used to confirm the presence of sars-cov-2 45  furthermore performance verification results revealed that the assay based on rdrp gene had a higher analytical sensitivity than those based on n and 11 e genes 41  in the united states the cdc has published their rt-pcr protocols for sars-cov-2 which are based on three primers n1 n2 and n3 for the n gene 43 46  moreover the high-throughput cobas 6800 assay by roche diagnostics targets the orf1a and e genes and is capable of offering fast and reliable results the specific primers for orf1a confirm sars-cov-2 infection and primers for the conserved e genes are used for all sarbecovirus detection 47 48  in china reagents mainly target the orf1ab and n genes according to the china cdc 49  although protocols based on different primers have been developed and approved quickly the lack of a thorough performance validation of and comparison between these protocols is considered a key gap recently a study compared two protocols developed by germany and cdc respectively 45 46  the results revealed that the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the n1 rdrp modified by the study and e assays were higher than those of the other assays 50  in summary the characteristics of the sars-cov-2 genome can guide the design of targeted gene regions and performance verification for molecular assays first diagnosis of the infection mainly depends on positive viral nucleic acid test results and not on clinical symptoms 51 asymptomatic infections that yield positive viral nucleic acid results may be potential sources of infection 29 52  second the selection of specimens for molecular assays is crucial viral loads of respiratory tract specimens are highest in balf followed by the sputum nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs when situation permits sample selection should be prioritized in the same order 12 to prevent misdiagnosis caused by insufficient viral load  fig 2c 53 54  recent studies have confirmed the validity of this selection priority the positive detection rate of nasopharyngeal swabs in 14 of 18 patients was higher than that of oropharyngeal swabs and the pcr ct values of the former were also lower 34  nasal and pharyngeal swab samples exhibited a lower positive rate compared with balf and sputum samples 55  in addition a recent study evaluated the positive detection rate of 1070 different specimens collected from 205 infected patients and the results revealed that the positive rate of balf was highest 1415 93 followed by sputum 75104 72 nasal swabs 58 63 throat swabs 1263932 stool 4453 29 blood 33071 and urine 072 0 53  therefore if multiple sampling methods can be adopted for patients specimens with high positive rates such as balf or sputum should be selected preferentially third a negative result from an oral-nasopharyngeal swab is not sufficient for a hospital discharge 56  in clinical application collecting balf requires complicated procedures and is not suitable for all patients and many patients have nonproductive cough so the feasibility of sputum sampling is low therefore nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs serve as the main sample types for clinical testing however these samples may yield negative results on molecular assays due to low viral loads leading to misdiagnosis even if results from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab are negative the virus may harbor in the gut or the recovered patient may still be a virus carrier 57  consequently negative testing results should be combined with the lack of clinical symptoms to properly guide discharge and a certain period of observation is 13 essential fourth sampling of different sites in suspected persons or repeatedly sampling at different infected stages may prevent false negative results from insufficient viral loads for instance virus positivity in stool specimens but negativity in respiratory tract specimens can suggest an infection 38  some patients with positive chest ct findings showed negative molecular results from mouth swabs and after repeated testing from mouth swabs they were all finally confirmed to have infections 39  in the diagnosis of suspected cases by rt-pcr several undesirable conditions may occur 1 false positive a specimen that does not contain sars-cov-2 tests positive for the virus 2 false negative a specimen containing a sufficient quantity of sars-cov-2 tests negative for the virus or 3 a specimen not containing sufficient sars-cov-2 tests negative for the virus a result that may not be consistent with highly suspected results from radiography for instance in the diagnosis of a group of suspected patients the positive rates from the rt-pcr of throat swabs and chest ct imaging were different approximately 59 6011014 and 88 8881014 respectively 6  although the ct test can yield some false positives a large number of highly suspected cases as determined by ct cannot be confirmed by rt-pcr and may lead to diagnostic confusion with possible serious outcomes in summary these three discrepant scenarios can mislead diagnosis and clinical management quality assurance would help improve the accuracy and reliability of sars-cov-2 molecular assays especially in the face of this highly contagious virus hence robust quality assurance 14 should be implemented in each clinical laboratory false positive results are mainly caused by cross-contamination between specimens or residual contamination from a prior laboratory amplification and the cross-reaction of other viruses due to nonspecific primers solutions include keeping the clinical laboratory environment clean and standardizing the procedures of specimen transportation and detection to prevent contamination 43  several negative quality control materials qcms should be randomly placed among clinical samples daily for analysis a method that can be effective in identifying systemic problems that lead to false positive results fig 2c 58  finally using primers that target the unique genomic regions of sars-cov-2 can specifically detect the virus and reduce crossreactivities false negative results are mainly due to unreliable detection reagents and nonstandard testing operations some assays target two or more regions of the viral genome for detection however the sensitivity of reagents in different regions may be different or competition may occur between these different targets 44  which results in false negatives since rna viruses have strong genetic variability 13  mismatches between primers and target sequences caused by mutations can lead to poor detection performance and false negatives 59  inactivation before testing should also be considered and common approaches include thermal and chemical inactivation high temperature can denature viral structural proteins to reduce their invasiveness however 15 studies found that approximately half of the weakly positive samples 715 467 were rt-pcr negative after thermal inactivation of sars-cov-2 at 56 for 45 min in at least one parallel testing 61  the reason might be that released rna from lysed viruses is degraded due to the breakage of chemical bonds caused by high temperature 60 61  and the degrees of degradation increased with temperature elevation 60  in conclusion rapid optimization of testing kit quality and standard operating procedures are top priorities for solving the issue of false negatives 65  first robust 16 performance verification of assays is required second choosing guanidine hydrochloride buffer instead of thermal inactivation if inactivation is required will exhibit a smaller impact on rt-pcr results 49 62  additionally it is desirable that laboratorians standardize the procedure of nucleic acid extraction and testing to avoid false negatives 46  third positive quality control materials such as synthetic sars-cov-2 rna or stocks from positive specimens should be used in the detection of clinical specimens fig 2c  and laboratories should participate in external quality assessment to improve testing proficiency 58  finally rt-pcr and serological assays can be combined in the progressive and recovery stages to reduce false negatives in sars-cov-2 infection rbd s and n proteins serve as the main antigens to stimulate the immune response of the body producing iga igm and igg antibodies the titer of secretory iga indicates mucosal immune responses against sars-cov-2 igm indicates the acute infectious stage while igg represents middle and later stages of infection or previous infection the temporal dynamics of antibodies against sars-cov-2 presented in different studies may be slightly discrepant and iga has been reported less often in this regard than igm and igg in one study iga and igm were both detectable at the 5 th day median while igg appeared on the 14 th day median 66  in another study the median seroconversion times for igm and igg were reported to be day 12 and day 14 67 fig 3  respectively subsequently the antibody levels increased rapidly the iga level was reported to not increase after day 21 the igm level did not increase significantly after about day 15 and was present from day 10 to day 30 and the igg level reached a plateau by day 21 where it persisted 66  in view of these time courses the serological analysis of igm and igg has the potential to determine the infection stages and assess disease epidemiology currently some antibody test kits have been applied in research or approved for clinical applications involving mainly applications for igm and igg  table 3  49  the detection targets include one or several specific antibodies or total antibodies 49 67  the antigens also vary in reagents including rbd s1 s and n proteins 66 68  and synthetic or other amino acid-like antigens have also been used 69  in clinical practice the specificity of antibody assays based on the rbd antigen can reach 90 in the detection based on s antigens the s1 antigen has a specificity of 100 for coronaviruses other than sars-cov and is more specific than the s antigen because the latter has cross-reactivity with mers-cov 71  this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the s2 subunit is more conserved than the s1 subunit in addition to sars-cov cross-reactivity with mers-cov was also found in assays based on the n protein 66 71  therefore rbd and s1 are more specific antigens for antibody assays than the s and n antigens some synthetic or other similar antigens were reported to exhibit a better performance and cannot be compared easily because of the difference in synthetic sequences 69 71  antibodies represent host humoral responses against sars-cov-2 indicating the status of infection therefore serological antibody assays can be used in the diagnosis of suspected cases either in combination with molecular testing or for additional testing in suspected cases with negative nucleic acid results fig 2 67  moreover the levels of igg and igm against the s and n proteins of sars-cov-2 were found to be correlated with virus neutralization titer 35  and a higher titer of antibody was independently associated with a worse clinical classification 67  these data suggest the potential value of antibody titers for evaluating the prognosis and recovery of patients since antibody titer in most patients increases 10 days after symptom onset  fig 3  sampling during the progressive and recovery periods is more effective fig   3  49  in summary serological antibody testing enables analysis of the dynamics of infections with sars-cov-2 more importantly it has lower operational requirements and can reduce the risk of medical staff exposure due to respiratory sampling despite the advantages of serological assays the testing performance of antibody assays should also be considered in an analysis of 397 and 128 blood samples from sars-cov-2 infected and uninfected individuals igmigg assays had a sensitivity and specificity of 8866 and 9063 respectively 68  therefore some situations that lead to false positives and false negatives still require attention cross-reactivity with other subtypes of coronaviruses may be a threat antibody assays are susceptible to the influence of endogenous interferents including rheumatoid factors heterophilic antibodies and complements 72 73  as well as exogenous factors such as specimen hemolysis yielding false positive results 74  enhancing the specificity of the antigen peptide of the reagents to reduce the cross-reactivity with other viruses and diluting the 19 specimens and changing the enzyme-labeled antibodies can reduce the incidence of false positives in addition a combination of antibody assays clinical symptoms and molecular results should be used for diagnosis to minimize false positives false negative results also require attention there are specific testing windows for serological antibody detection iga and igm usually last a short time and igg may be produced in the later period so sampling at unsuitable stages may lead to false negatives 68  differences in individual immune response and antibody production also may lead to false negative results therefore at least two serology results at different time points combined with negative rt-pcr result are helpful to rule out false negatives fig 2c  testing strategy is also important the combined igm-igg test was reported to have better practicality and sensitivity than tests for only igm or igg 68  in addition some laboratories will inactivate samples before nucleic acid testing but it is controversial whether to inactivate samples before antibody testing 64 the instructions of igmigg detection kits magnetic particle luminescence bioscience indicate that serum specimens should be thermally inactivated at 56  for 45  5 min some kits colloidal gold linzon and colloidal gold shanghai superchip indicate that the inactivation of the samples at 56 for 30 min has no significant effect on the results however another two detection kits for igg colloidal gold wondfo and igm colloidal gold hecin specify not to use samples with thermal inactivation other instructions of antibody detection kits approved by the nmpa or available in the world do not include any inactivation information in theory thermal inactivation may affect antibody testing as the antibodies are proteins but the impact may be specific to the kits and their testing 20 principle additional research on the effect of inactivation on antibody testing should be conducted in the future the sars-cov-2 epidemic is spreading worldwide accurate diagnostic assays can offer a robust way for the timely identification of infected individuals which is key to preventing retransmission of sars-cov-2 rt-pcr is widely employed in the molecular diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection in laboratories and dynamic serological antibody assays are supplementary methods both methods should be designed according to the characteristics of sars-cov-2 gene regions including orf1ab n and s genes are commonly targeted regions for rt-pcr 43  and rbd s1 s and n proteins or synthetic antigens can be used to detect antibodies in serological assays balf typically has the highest viral load followed by sputum nasal swabs and pharyngeal swabs suggesting the ideal priority order for selecting specimens 53  viral nucleic acid and antibody concentrations fluctuate in different infection stages suggesting infection status may be determined using a combination of molecular and serological assays 67  in the incubation period and early infection stage respiratory tract specimens should be used for molecular detection in progressive stages both the molecular and serological assays are useful for diagnosis in the recovery stage serology assays can be used to determine infection and recovery fig 3  for rt-pcr results inconsistent with clinical picture sampling in different organs or repeatedly sampling at different stages may prevent negative results due to insufficient viral loads notably quality assurance of assays is essential for the reliable detection of sars- 21 cov-2 and each laboratory should conduct quality assurance measures to improve testing proficiency 58  full understanding of the genomic characteristics transmission and clinical features of sars-cov-2 will lead to better molecular and serological assays and provide clinical testing personnel information to improve the accuracy of sars-cov-2 testing  a orf open reading frame rdrp rna-dependent rna polymerase   the role of laboratory diagnostics in emerging viral infections the example of the middle east respiratory syndrome epidemic jasper chan f w   siddharth sridhar cyril yip c y susanna lau k p patrick woo c y  rapidly emerging infectious disease outbreaks place a great strain on laboratories to develop and implement sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for patient management and infection control in a timely manner furthermore laboratories also play a role in real-time zoonotic environmental and epidemiological investigations to identify the ultimate source of the epidemic facilitating measures to eventually control the outbreak each assay modality has unique pros and cons therefore incorporation of a battery of tests using traditional culture-based molecular and serological diagnostics into diagnostic algorithms is often required as such laboratories face challenges in assay development test evaluation and subsequent quality assurance in this review we describe the different testing modalities available for the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome mers epidemic including cell culture nucleic acid amplification antigen detection and antibody detection assays applications of such tests in both acute clinical and epidemiological investigation settings are highlighted using the mers epidemic as an example we illustrate the various challenges faced by laboratories in test development and implementation in the setting of a rapidly emerging infectious disease future directions in the diagnosis of mers and other emerging infectious disease investigations are also highlighted  the ongoing threat of emerging viral infections to global pub-lic health is well evidenced by the recent epidemics caused by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov avian influenza a viruses ebola virus and zika virus to et al  2014 chan et al 2015b chan et al  2015c  prompt and accurate diagnosis is the first step in the successful control of any of these epidemics and is particularly important for emerging viral infections because they may spread rapidly and may be associated with severe complications sridhar et al 2015  definitive diagnosis of these emerging viral infections usually requires laboratory confirmation because their clinical features and epidemiological risk factors may be similar to those of other related infections the characteristics of an ideal laboratory assay for diagnosing these infections include high sensitivity high specificity short turn-around time low cost low expertise and facility requirement suitability for use in different specimen types availability for pointof-care testing poct and capability to quantify viral load unfortunately despite the recent advances in the field no single laboratory diagnostic test has all of these characteristics it is therefore important to understand the clinical applications of the various types of laboratory diagnostic assays and their roles in the control of emerging viral epidemics in this review we use the mers epidemic as an example to illustrate the advantages disadvantages practical uses and impact on epidemic control of the major types of laboratory diagnostic assays available for emerging viral infections middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a novel lineage c betacoronavirus first isolated from a saudi arabian man with severe acute community-acquired pneumonia and acute kidney injury in 2012 zaki et al 2012  as of 5 december 2016 1864 cases of human mers cases including 659 fatalities have been reported by the world health organization httpwhointemergenciesmers-cov en the epidemic has continued to expand since 2012 with most human cases of mers being reported in the middle east as a result of animal-to-human transmissions from infected animal reservoirs dromedary camels and possibly bats in the region and person-to-person transmissions in healthcare-associated outbreaks reusken et al 2013a haagmans et al 2014 wang et al 2014 chan et al 2015b  moreover sporadic cases and clusters of human mers infection have also occurred in other areas with imported cases of mers such as the republic of korea  the clinical presentation of mers may range from asymptomatic infection detected during contact tracing in outbreak investigations to rapidly fatal disease chan et al 2015b  the disease is especially severe in elderly men with co-morbidities assiri et al 2013a  severe mers is characterized by rapidly progressive acute pneumonia with fever and respiratory failure not responsive to broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment and may be associated with extrapulmonary manifestations including acute kidney injury hepatic dysfunction gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures chan et al 2012 chan et al  2013c zaki et al 2012 assiri et al 2013a arabi et al 2015  a number of repurposed drugs antiviral peptides and monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated anti-mers-cov activity in vitro andor in animal models but none of them have been proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials yet chan et al 2013b chan et al  2015d gao et al 2013 lu et al 2014a jiang et al 2014 tang et al 2014 ying et al 2014  various vaccines have been developed and some are undergoing clinical trials andor testing in camels uyeki et al 2016  like all other infectious diseases appropriate specimen collection is the most important step in the laboratory diagnosis of mers and requires knowledge of viral kinetics in various specimen types with relation to time since symptom onset like sars-cov mers-cov viral loads in respiratory specimens peak in the second week after symptom onset oh et al 2016  therefore a patient testing negative for mers soon after symptom onset should undergo repeated testing if epidemiological history is suggestive of mers lower respiratory tract specimens including tracheal aspirates bronchoalveolar lavage fluid well collected sputum specimens contain the highest viral rna loads and should be collected whenever possible corman et al 2016 oh et al 2016  however invasive procedures to obtain lower respiratory specimens may not always be feasible especially in patients with mild illness upper respiratory tract specimens nasopharyngeal swabs oropharyngeal swabs andor nasopharyngeal aspirates should be taken for such cases with pooling of swabs in a single container to maximize rna load as viral loads in the upper respiratory tract are consistently lower than in the lower respiratory tract memish et al 2014b corman et al 2016  risk assessment regarding requisite transmission-based precautions patient placement and personal protective equipment during specimen collection should be conducted due to the possibility of aerosol generation specimens should be sent to the laboratory in viral transport medium containing a balanced salt solution bovine serum albumin ph buffer phenol red and antimicrobials as soon as possible if specimen processing is likely to be delayed storage in an ultra-low freezer -80c is recommended extrapulmonary specimens that have been reported to contain detectable mers-cov rna include blood stool and urine drosten et al 2013 poissy et al 2014 corman et al 2016  these specimens may provide further opportunities for mers diagnosis when lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable however viral loads in these specimen types are generally lower than in the lower respiratory tract although there are reported exceptions abroug et al 2014  detection of mers-cov in stool specimens may have infection control implications while detection of mers-cov rna in whole blood or serum in particular may be a prognostic marker of poor outcome guery et al 2013 kim et al 2016c  for serology testing acute and convalescent serum specimens should ideally be collected 14 to 21 days apart to enable documentation of seroconversion or 4-fold rise in neu-tralizing antibody titer when no serum specimen from the acute phase is available a convalescent phase serum specimen may also be used to establish retrospective diagnosis with a panel of antibody tests see serology section below the choice of investigation will depend on the specimen type timing post-symptom onset and local test availability the advantages and shortcomings of different tests are detailed below and summarized in table 1  isolation of infectious mers-cov in cell culture inoculated with the patients bodily fluids andor tissues establishes the diagnosis of mers zaki et al 2012  although the routine use of viral culture for diagnosing mers in standard clinical microbiology laboratories is limited by the methods relatively slower turn-around time than molecular diagnostics and requirement of a biosafety level 3 facility this time-tested diagnostic tool has played important roles in the discovery and studies on the pathogenesis and antivirals of mers-cov unlike the other human-pathogenic covs which are notoriously difficult to culture in cell lines mers-cov replicates rapidly with induction of prominent cytopathic effects in a broad range of cell lines muller et al 2012 chan et al 2013a  mers-cov produces focal cytopathic effects with rounded refractile cells in susceptible cell lines within 5 days after inoculation during primary isolation chan et al 2013a  the spread of these changes throughout the cell monolayers leads to rounding and detachment of cells within 1 to 2 days syncytium formation caused by fusion activity of the mers-cov spike s protein may be seen in calu-3 caco-2 huh-7 and llc-mk2 cell lines zaki et al 2012 chan et al 2013a de wilde et al 2013  these rapid and prominent cytopathic effects allowed zaki and colleagues to successfully isolate the first mers-cov strain from cell lines which were commonly used in clinical virology laboratories vero and llc-mk2 shortly after inoculation of the index patients sputum sample into these cell lines zaki et al 2012  a recent comparison between vero and caco-2 cell lines for the isolation of mers-cov showed that the isolation rate of mers-cov was significantly higher in caco-2 than in vero cells 455 vs 191 p  0013 muth et al 2015  the isolation rate of mers-cov in cell culture was higher in respiratory samples with higher viral rna loads 667 vs 59 in samples with 10 7 copiesml and 10 7 copiesml respectively lower respiratory tract samples 00 in nasopharyngeal aspirate 333 in sputa and 486 in endotracheal aspirates and samples which were collected earlier after diagnosis 586 vs 222 in samples collected within and after 5 days of diagnosis respectively these factors should be considered in laboratories which are attempting to isolate mers-cov from clinical specimens the broad tissue tropism of mers-cov in cell lines of different human organ tissue origins corroborated with the protean clinical manifestations of mers in human the high viral load of mers-cov in human lung kidney colonic and hepatic cell lines correlate with the predominantly lower respiratory tract involvement and extrapulmonary manifestations of acute kidney injury diarrhea and hepatic dysfunction respectively chan et al 2015b  most of these in vitro observations were subsequently validated in ex vivo organ tissue culture andor animal models chan et al 2013f zhou et al 2014 chu et al 2016 yeung et al 2016  the replication of mers-cov in monocytes dendritic cells and t lymphocytes with aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokineschemokines and activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways partly explained the pathogenesis of virus dissemination cytokinechemokine storm and lymphopenia in severe mers lau et al 2013a chu et al 2014 chu et al  2016 zhou et al 2014 zhou et al  2015 scheuplein et al 2015  tynell et al 2016  moreover mers-cov could be isolated from numerous non-human cell lines including those of nonhuman primate camel and bat origins muller et al 2012 chan et al 2013a eckerle et al 2014  in contrast cell lines of mouse and rat origins were not susceptible chan et al 2013a  these in vitro biological characteristics of mers-cov provided insights on the possible clinical manifestations animal reservoirs and animal species which were susceptible to mers-cov infection for animal model development at an early stage of the epidemic de wit et al 2013a munster et al 2013 coleman et al 2014 falzarano et al 2014 yao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 agrawal et al 2015 chan et al 2015d haagmans et al 2015  viral culture of mers-cov also facilitated the identification and evaluation of anti-mers-cov drugs screening of potential candidate anti-mers-cov agents in chemical libraries consisting of a large number of clinically approved drugs and validation of their in vitro anti-mers-cov activity in cytopathic effect inhibition viral load reduction and plaque reduction assays using cell culture systems successfully identified repurposed drugs such as type i interferons and lopinavir-ritonavir for further testing in animal models chan et al 2013b dyall et al 2014 de wilde et al 2014  similarly the anti-mers-cov effects of newly designed antiviral peptides and monoclonal antibodies were also validated in cell culture gao et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 lu et al 2014a tang et al 2014 ying et al 2014  the availability of viral culture for mers-cov in reference research laboratories is crucial for further deepening our understanding on and finding countermeasures for mers given the limitations of viral culture more rapid and readily available laboratory assays were required for diagnosing mers specific primers and a standardized laboratory protocol were quickly developed after the successful isolation of the first mers-cov strain and sequencing of its complete genome early in the epidemic in september 2012 palm et al 2012  the positive sense single-stranded rna genome of mers-cov has a size of approximately 30 kb and is arranged in the order of 5-replicase open reading frame orf 1abstructural proteins s-envelope e-membrane m-nucleocapsid n-polya-3 woo et al 2012 chan et al 2013d lau et al 2013b  a number of monoplex reverse transcrip-tion-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays using primers that target conserved gene regions of the mers-cov genome were developed and evaluated for screening andor confirmatory tests these gene targets include the leader sequence at the 5untranslated region and orf1a orf1b rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp orf4a upe upstream of envelope e gene m and n gene regions corman et al 2012a corman et al  2012b lu et al 2014b chan et al 2015a douglas et al 2015  the most commonly adopted diagnostic protocol utilizes the upe assay as a screening test followed by either the orf1a or orf1b assays for confirmation in general these assays were highly sensitive and specific with their technical limits of detection ranging from 16 to 2630 rna copiesreaction chan et al 2015b kim et al 2016b  the limits of detection appear to be the lowest in the assays targeting the abundantly expressed leader sequence at the 5-untranslated region and the n gene although clinical comparison among the various assays have not been reported most of these assays were evaluated using clinical specimens including respiratory nasopharyngeal aspirate sputum endotracheal aspirate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid andor nose and mouth exudates andor extrapulmonary specimens serum urine andor stool a number of regional and international external quality assessments showed that the majority 80 of participating laboratories were capable of detecting mers-cov rna by rt-pcr assays with high accuracy but false-negative results might occur in a minority of samples with low viral loads pas et al 2015 seong et al 2016 zhang et al 2016  recent advances in molecular diagnostics for mers include the development of commercial monoplex and multiplex rt-pcr kits and other novel non-pcr-based diagnostics most of the commercial assays utilize primers that target the upe andor orf1a gene regions kim et al 2016b httpwwwfast-trackdiagnostics comproductsftd-mers-cov httpengbioneercomdiagnostichumanmdxkitsaccupower-mers-cov-multiplexoverviewaspx httpseegenecomneoenproductsrespiratoryanyplexmerscovphp internal controls of these assays include primers against human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene which is a housekeeping gene found in clinical specimens spiked rna tobacco mosaic virus dna or phocine herpesvirus dna spiked in the pcr mixtures analytical and clinical evaluation of these assays showed that they generally had high sensitivity and specificity but false-negative or invalid results may occur in specimens containing high levels of pcr inhibitors such as sputum specimens kim et al 2016b  sputum homogenization prior to nucleic acid extraction with proteinase k and dnase treatment may be more effective than either phosphate-buffered saline treatment or n-acetyl-l-cysteine and sodium citrate treatment for improving the sensitivity of these assays  the performance of multiplex assays may be improved by the use of self-avoiding molecular recognition system-artificially expanded genetic information systems samrs-aegis primers to reduce non-specific reactions generated among the multiple primers in the same assay glushakova et al 2015 yaren et al 2016  the main advantage of these commercial diagnostic kits is their ease for use in laboratories without technical expertise for designing and performing in-house-developed rt-pcr assays the major disadvantage is their relatively high costs which may limit their use in resource-limited regions other non-pcr-based assays for mers include reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp and reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification rt-rpa abd el wahed et al 2013 shirato et al 2014 bhadra et al 2015  these isothermal assays generally have short incubation times and are highly sensitive and specific they are simple to perform and do not require thermocyclers and are therefore especially suitable for poct in resource-limited areas where the expertise and equipment for rt-pcr are not readily available in addition to establishing diagnosis nucleic acid amplification tests have been applied to fulfill a number of other important purposes in the mers epidemic firstly it was used to investigate the animal reservoir of mers-cov and established the link between dromedary camels and human cases of mers haagmans et al 2014 lau et al 2016  the higher rate of detection of mers-cov rna in the nasal andor rectal swabs of juvenile camels than in those of adult camels further helped to identify juvenile camels as an important source of camel-to-human transmission of mers alagaili et al 2014 wernery et al 2015  secondly rt-pcr is commonly employed in contact tracing during healthcare-associated outbreaks of mers assiri et al 2013b memish et al 2013 drosten et al 2014 oboho et al 2015  during these outbreak investigations it was recognized that asymptomatic infection might occur in young and previously healthy persons and that they might serve as the source of further person-to-person transmission of mers memish et al  2014a omrani et al 2013  thirdly serial testing of different clinical samples of mers patients by rt-pcr identified the shedding patterns of the virus in respiratory and non-respiratory samples notably viral rna was detected in 146 of stool and 24 of urine samples suggesting that these clinical samples may also be important in the spread of mers fourthly viral rna load was found to be a predictive factor for severe disease high mers-cov load in lower respiratory tract specimens was predictive of progression to pneumonia blood mers-cov rna positivity at initial diagnosis was associated with worse clinical outcome in terms of a higher rate of requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as well as death p005 fifthly rt-pcr was commonly employed in in vitro and in vivo antiviral and vaccine evaluation studies zumla et al 2016  finally rt-pcr and sequencing were important for surveying molecular epidemiological changes that may be associated with virus adaption for efficient person-toperson transmission molecular diagnostic assays have excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of mers-cov infection however these assays require dedicated facilities expensive equipment and highly trained personnel which places a great strain on laboratory infrastructure in endemic areas of mers therefore there has been considerable interest in developing mers-cov antigen detection assays which are better than pcr diagnosis in terms of convenience specific monoclonal antibodies targeting mers-cov proteins are used to demonstrate evidence of mers-cov in infected tissues de wit et al 2013b  such antibodies have also been used to detect the mers-cov n protein in respiratory specimens as this antigen is abundantly expressed during the acute phase of illness four assays for detection of the mers-cov n protein have been described to date song et al 2015 yamaoka et al 2016  the peptides used to immunize mice for raising monoclonal antibodies were either in the form of recombinant protein synthetically produced by cloning the corresponding dna fragment into e coli and subsequently purifying the protein or prepared using a wheat germ extract-based cell free expression system researchers either used a single long peptide or a pool of smaller synthetic peptides spanning the length of the mers-cov n protein song et al 2015 yamaoka et al 2016  monoclonal antibodies that produced favorable signal-tonoise ratios in a recombinant mers-cov n protein immunoassay were selected for incorporation into either an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa yamaoka et al 2016 or a poct format chen et al 2016  the analytical sensitivity of antigen detection assays was measured using lower limit-of-detection lod experiments we have previously described an elisa assay that had an lod of 10 tcid5001 ml using simulated npa specimens seeded with serially diluted mers-cov cultures  a lateral flow immunoassay lfia also described by us had an lod of at least 10 37 tcid50ml mers-cov  an immunochromatographic test ict developed by song et al had a lod of 15 ngml recombinant mers-cov n protein while the elisa assay developed by yamaoka et al could detect 0625 ngml of n protein yamaoka et al 2016  due to careful selection of monoclonal antibodies the published assays were quite specific for mers-cov and did not cross-react with other animal or human coronaviruses the main advantage of antigen detection assays is their ease of use and rapid results especially when adapted to a poct format pocts can be performed entirely within a biosafety cabinet have built-in quality control and require minimal training of laboratory personnel they offer a rapid and specific rule-in option for clinicians while pending pcr tests which may require send out to reference laboratories and long turnaround times in regions where laboratory infrastructure is not well developed however there are several obstacles to the application of antigen detection for the diagnosis of mers in humans firstly such assays have not been validated in clinical specimens from suspected mers cases in endemic areas there is no head-to-head comparison with pcr which is the most commonly employed platinum standard diagnostic method in mers patients from experience with other respiratory viruses the sensitivity is expected to be lower than pcr tests which may provide false reassurance and lapses in infection control if false negative results are interpreted without a confirmatory pcr assay chan et al 2002  furthermore antigen detection pocts and elisas designed to date have only been evaluated using nasopharyngeal specimens it is unknown whether such assays can be used on lower respiratory tract specimens which are often observed to contain higher viral loads than npa drosten et al 2013 guery et al 2013 and would theoretically be even more suitable for antigen detection assays lastly antigen detection assays do not feature in who or cdc algorithms for the diagnosis of mers limiting interest in developing commercial kits up to this stage httpwwwcdcgovcoronavirusmerslablab-testinghtml httpappswhointirisbitstream10665176982 1whomerslab151engpdf antigen detection assays may have a potential role in the epidemiological surveillance of camels the ict developed by song et al was validated using camel nasal swabs demonstrating a high sensitivity 939 and specificity 996 compared to upe and orf1a real time rt-pcr  our lfia also showed a moderately high sensitivity of 81 with excellent specificity compared to real time rt-pcr on dromedary camel respiratory specimens  these studies indicate that such assays can be used for conveniently detecting infected camels in rural endemic areas data regarding the kinetics of the antibody response in mers patients is steadily accumulating there appears to be considerable person-to-person variation in the robustness and timing of the antibody response but as with other viral infections an initial igm response is followed by rising igg titers which is usually detectable 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset drosten et al 2013 chan et al 2015b park et al 2015b  longitudinal serology of one mers-infected patient in china showed that anti-s elisa antibodies rose before anti-n antibodies wang et al 2016a  the differential kinetics of anti-n and anti-s antibodies in the setting of mers serodiagnosis requires further study antibodies remain detectable long after clearance of infection neutralizing antibodies were persistently detectable in 86 of patients up to 34 months after the jordanian mers outbreak of 2012 payne et al 2016  a wide variety of serological assays have been described for the detection of mers-cov-specific antibodies with variations in assay format the antigen used and the antibody subtype detected mers specific igm detection does not feature in diagnostic algorithms promulgated by the who or us cdc httpwwwcdcgovcoronavirusmerslablab-testinghtml httpappswhointirisbitstream10665176982 1whomerslab151engpdf although igm titers theoretically rise before igg experience with sera from sars and mers patients suggests that the time lag between the two may be too short to be of much clinical value woo et al 2004 meyer et al 2014a wang et al 2016b  furthermore igm assays are potentially prone to non-specific positivity and cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses requiring te- dious specimen preparation and quality control buchholz et al 2013  the additional value of testing mers-cov igm in patients presenting with acute illness requires further elucidation in view of these factors most of the serological assays described for mers diagnosis either aim to detect total immunoglobulin or igg a major variable in serological assays for mers-cov is the source of the antigen for reference or research laboratories with bsl-3 and cell culture facilities mers-cov-infected cells are the most convenient source of antigen the cell lysate may be spotted on glass slides microtiter plates or western blot strips for downstream serological assays although convenient such assays require a reliable means of inactivating live virus within the culture extracts furthermore such assays have also been shown to cross react with other coronaviruses as infected cells express a wide range of viral antigens some of which are likely to be conserved across different coronavirus subgroups and even genera aburizaiza et al 2014  for sars it has been shown that western blotting with whole virus lysates may enable us to differentiate genuine seropatterns from false-positives however this is a tedious procedure requiring technical expertise and well characterized control sera  in view of these shortcomings recombinant antigens have been used for elisa immunofluorescence ifa western blot protein microarray and even pseudoparticle neutralization assays corman et al 2012b perera et al 2013 reu-sken et al 2013b chan et al 2015b park et al 2015a wang et al 2016b  using recombinant antigens has two major advantages firstly biosafety during assay production is not a major concern and secondly this method enables the selection of immunogenic and mers-cov-specific antigens for maximizing assay specificity and sensitivity both viral n and s proteins are abundantly expressed immunogenic antigens stimulating antibody production meyer et al 2014a  in sars patients there is evidence that anti-n antibodies rise before anti-s antibodies woo et al 2005  however convalescent sera tend to react against both antigens with moderate to high sensitivity the difference between the two antigens lies in their specificity although the n protein is easier to clone and purify being smaller with fewer glycosylation sites it is more conserved within coronavirus subgroups compared to the s protein which is the major target for neutralizing antibodies meyer et al 2014a  therefore recombinant mers-cov n protein-based serological assays are expected to have higher rates of cross reactivity compared to anti-s detection assays indeed n epitope cross reactivity may even extend across coronavirus genera a sars-cov n protein-based elisa showed a propensity to produce false positive results when tested against convalescent sera from patients recovering from hcov-229e and even hcov-oc43 infections woo et al 2005  however there is evidence to suggest that even sections of the s2 subunit of the s protein can induce cross-reactive antibodies against different beta-coronaviruses chan et al 2013e  further studies are required to elucidate optimally specific recombinant antigens for mers serological tests many of the classical serological assay formats have been applied to mers with modifications in the interest of assay specificity and biosafety the principles advantages and disadvantages of each assay type are summarized in table 2  commercial igg elisa assays are now available and provide a fast and sensitive screening tool positive results by elisa require confirmation by a more specific assay -either ifa or gold-standard neutralization assays detailed evaluations for many of the published assays have not been possible because of a lack of well-characterized control sera while the specificity of most assays can be assessed using sera of patients in non-endemic regions diagnostic sensitivity and comparison-of-methods data are still difficult to come by in a recent study park et al compared the plaque reduction neutralization test prnt microneutralization and pseudoparticle neutralization tests using sera of 17 patients from the south korean mers outbreak park et al 2015a  they found that the different neutralization test formats had excellent correlation with each other when testing convalescent clinical specimens in the first ten days after symptom onset anti-mers antibodies are usually undetectable irrespective of assay format park et al 2015a park et al  2015b  therefore serology testing is not useful in acute mers although the who includes seroconversion confirmed by neutralization in paired sera taken at least 14 days apart as one of the diagnostic criteria for a confirmed case httpappswhointirisbitstream10665176982 1whomerslab151engpdf the role of mers serology therefore is threefold firstly to provisionally diagnose mild or asymptomatic mers cases who present late with only convalescent sera available secondly for serosurveillance of at-risk individuals either as part of an outbreak investigation or in abattoirs where exposure to zoonotic sources may have occurred muller et al 2015 kim et al 2016a  thirdly for seroepidemiological studies of zoonotic sources to identify affected camel herds indeed demonstration of mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in camel sera is one of the lines of evidence for zoonotic transmission of mers from camels to humans meyer et al 2014b  in view of the deficiencies of serological assays outlined in table 2  most authorities recommend using at least two different assays for specific serodiagnosis of mers the who recommends using either an elisa-or ifa-based screening assay followed by confirmatory testing of positive sera using a specific neutralization assay httpappswhointirisbitstream106651769821whomerslab151engpdf the cdc also adopts a two-phase approach with the first test being an igg elisa followed by confirmatory testing using ifa httpwwwcdcgovcoronavirusmerslablabtestinghtml microneutralization is performed on elisapositive ifa-indeterminate sera for final resolution the experience with mers and other recent transnational epidemics proves that emerging infectious diseases will con-tinue to be a major challenge in the future rising human populations force animals and humans into ever closer proximity increasing the risk of zoonotic transmission of novel infectious diseases overcrowding facilitates human-to-human transmission of these infections both in the community and in healthcare settings high volumes of air travel enable rapid transport of infected humans to non-endemic regions leading to major outbreaks all these features were clearly illustrated in the recent mers epidemic the key to combating these threats is information sharing constant vigilance and efficient infection control the diagnostic laboratory plays an increasingly important role in the early detection of infected patients enabling prompt initiation of infection control measures and appropriate patient management however this role is a complex one requiring a battery of tests and diagnostic algorithms as highlighted in this review the laboratory also faces several challenges in this role related to assay validation reagent shortages a lack of standard materials protocol standardization and quality assurance creation of regional and global laboratory networks under the aegis of the who or other organizations will be crucial to overcome these difficulties pooling of positive control material for serological and molecular assays in biobanks would also be valuable this is particularly important with the increasing introduction of massively multiplexed and point-of-care tests for the diagnosis of emerging infections which is an emerging trend in the microbiology laboratory   serologic responses of 42 mers-coronavirus-infected patients according to the disease severity jae-hoon ko marcel mller a hyeri

2016 min et al 2016 park et al 2015 payne et al 2016 however practical analysis of serodiagnostic parameters for clinical usage was limited in previous studies due to insufficient sample size or clinical information we managed 45 mers-cov-infected patients which is the largest number of patients as a single center during the 2015 korean mers outbreak total 186 patients identified cho et al 2016 kim et al 2016 park et al 2016 and reported that mers-cov-infected patients experienced 4 distinct clinical courses ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation ko et al 2016 based on these findings we evaluated serologic response of 42 mers-cov-infected patients according to the disease severity to investigate potential role of serodiagnostic parameters as prognostic markers among 45 mers-cov-infected patients who were admitted to samsung medical center a 1950-bed tertiary care university hospital during the 2015 korean mers outbreak ko et al 2016 we obtained sera from 42 patients mers-cov infections were confirmed on the basis of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr assays targeting upstream of the e gene upe and the open-reading frame gene 1a orf1a corman et al 2012a madani 2014 epidemiologic investigation data and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain exact exposure date symptom onset clinical course and outcome data for the patients one or 2 residual serum samples per week of illness were used for serologic testing during hospitalization periods follow-up serum samples obtained at outpatient clinics were also tested up to 6 months from symptom onset the institutional review board of samsung medical center approved the present study the clinical course of mers-cov-infected patients was assessed 6 weeks after symptom onset and patients were divided into 4 disease severity groups asymptomatic infection group 0 symptomatic infection without pneumonia group 1 pneumonia without respiratory failure group 2 and pneumonia progressing to respiratory failure group 3 ko et al 2016 for practical purposes respiratory failure was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation only patients in group 3 experienced fatal outcomes 513 385 and interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in median iqr 19355 proportion of underlying immunocompromising conditions including diabetes solid cancer or hematologic malignancies was not different between groups ko et al 2016 the distinct clinical presentation of the 4 severity groups are presented in supplementary figs 1 and 2 and supplementary table 1 in addition to the previous report ko et al 2016 seroconversion status was determined based on neutralization activity if none of the serum samples from a mers-cov-infected patient necessarily including sera obtained after the third week of illness showed neutralization activity the patient was considered to have negative seroconversion if none of the serum samples obtained by the end of the third week of illness showed neutralization activity and no samples were available for neutralization tests thereafter the patient was considered to have an indeterminate response ie interpretation not applicable if any serum showed neutralization activity the patient was considered to have positive seroconversion patients with an indeterminate response were excluded from calculation of the seroconversion rate this definition is based on the premise that no patients had previous exposure to mers-cov as this was the first mers outbreak in korea as a non-endemic country during the outbreak mers-cov exposure dates and symptom onsets were clearly identified in most patients owing to thorough contact investigation and monitoring of exposed individuals cho et al 2016 park et al 2016 mers-related symptoms included fever myalgia cough sputum and diarrhea to provide a common point of reference we used days post onset of illness dpoi to evaluate mers-cov-infected patients for asymptomatic patients the day of diagnosis of mers-cov infection was considered as day of symptom onset ko et al 2016 anti-mers-cov elisa igg and iga euroimmun lbeck germany were based on soluble mers-cov spike protein s1 domain expressed in hek-293 t cells muller et al 2014 muller et al 2015 muth et al 2015 raj et al 2013 sera were tested according to the manufacturers instructions with 1100 dilutions secondary detection was done with peroxidase-labeled anti-human igg and iga cutoff values of od ratio 04 for elisa igg and 02 for elisa iga were applied in the present study as these values exhibited optimal performance in predicting neutralization activity ko et al 2017 anti-mers-cov ifa igm euroimmun was performed with slides carrying vero cells infected with full mers-cov corman et al 2012b meyer et al 2014 muller et al 2014 muller et al 2015 sera were tested according to the manufacturers instructions with 110 dilutions weekly positive ifa intensity was considered

for comparison of clinical variables between groups one-way analysis of variance anova or kruskal-wallis test was used for continuous variables and chi-square or fishers exact test was used for categorical variables six-week survival probability was calculated using the kaplanmeier method the cox proportional hazard model and log-rank test were used to examine the association of seroconversion status with the 6-week mortality of mers patients having pneumonia all p-values were 2-tailed and those 005 were considered to be statistically significant r-331 for windows rstudio boston ma usa was used for all statistical analyses seroconversion status of 42 mers-cov-infected patients is summarized in table 1

  0005 by the cox proportional hazard model in predicting 6-week mortality since previous hospital-associated outbreaks of mers occurred in endemic countries where primary infections flow from community into hospitals detailed clinical data of each patient were hard to obtain corman et al 2016 however during the 2015 korean mers outbreak the first outbreak in a non-endemic country epidemiologic links and entire clinical course of each patients could be clearly identified ko et al 2016 park et al 2016 owing to the detailed epidemiologic and clinical information about patients we could find out different serologic response depending on disease severity and outcome although different seroconversion rates depending on disease severity can be inferred from previous serologic investigation min et al 2016 the number of evaluated mers patients was limited to 14 and neutralization testing was not performed in that study a robust increment of elisa igg titer with a 3-fold increase in od ratio was exclusively observed among patients with severe pneumonia while mild infections exhibited a modest increment in od ratio if any likewise we noted that asymptomatic mers-cov-infected cases did not show serologic response including prnt within 6 months and the seroconversion rate increased with the disease severity although the number of asymptomatic patients was limited to 3 in the present analysis it is less likely that asymptomatic patients will experience seroconversion considering that even group 1 patients with obvious mers-related symptoms showed low seroconversion rate of 60 this finding correlates with another serologic study that evaluated 11 rrt-pcr-confirmed mers patients choe et al 2017 in that study antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients with mild illness were undetectable in addition most contact surveys of mers-cov could not detect additional rrt-pcr-negative prnt-positive mers-cov infections breakwell et al 2015 buchholz et al 2013 choi et al 2016 ko et al 2017 these findings imply that serologic surveys to detect subclinical infections among asymptomatic individuals would not be effective serologic response was delayed in group 3 patients and negative seroconversion by the third week of illness was associated with fatal outcome among patients with mers pneumonia hr 2783 95 ci 27628021 p
  0005 delayed commencement of serologic response in severe disease was also suggested by previous report by park et al park et al 2015 although seroconversion timing was not statistically significantly delayed in group 3 patients in the present study delayed increment of igg iga and igm titers after the third week was demonstrated in group 3 however the delayed serologic response in group 3 could not be used as predictor for respiratory failure as respiratory failure progressed during the 2nd week of illness 12 dpoi in median meanwhile negative seroconversion in mers pneumonia by the third week of illness was associated with fatal outcome in the present analysis impaired serologic response in deceased patient was also noted in the paper of corman et al but insufficient clinical information especially day of symptom onset hampered more detailed analysis in association with timeline corman et al 2016 in this study we could obtain exact clinical information including day of symptom onset and figured it out that seroconversion status by the third week of illness by 21 dpoi can serve as a prognostic marker another important point is that mers-cov-infected patients in the present analysis died later than previous reports probably owing to antiviral therapy or aggressive critical care including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo the median interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in the present study which is much longer than 115 days in previous reports zumla et al 2015 although rapidly deteriorating mers cases would die before the third week of illness there certainly is a population that benefit from prognosis prediction by serologic response aggressive managements including ecmo should be considered for pneumonia patients without seroconversion by the third week of illness although seroconversion status can be confirmed by neutralization tests it cannot be readily performed worldwide corman et al 2016 in the present analysis seroconversion status of the third week assessed by elisa igg and iga was similar with that by prnt these elisa tests can be practically used for predicting poor prognosis of mers pneumonia in the field of patient management as a retrospective study serum samples of each patient could not be collected with same interval however we applied strict criteria for seroconversion excluding patients who did not have follow-up samples after the third week of illness as indeterminate response in the previous report with the same patient population we also suggest predictive factors for disease progression using clinical variables within 3 days from symptom onset ko et al 2016 together with the present paper these factors could be used complementarily in managing mers-cov-infected patients in addition although we identified that seroconversion status by the third week was associated with fatal outcomes of mers pneumonia we could not perform multivariate analysis due to limited sample size this finding need to be further evaluated with enough patient numbers of mers pneumonia in conclusion in a serologic investigation of 42 mers-cov-infected patients mild cases showed low seroconversion rates while fatal cases showed impaired serologic responses this work was supported by a samsung biomedical research institute sbri grant smx1161321 cd reports funding by eu grants antigone ga no 278976 and prepare ga no 602525 there are no potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article to report  case series of coronavirus sars-cov-2 in a military recruit school clinical sanitary and logistical implications sascha baettig j a parini i cardona g morand b   a new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome called sars-cov-21 emerged in the region of wuhan mainland china in december 20192 this rapidly spreading virus most likely originated from bat to human transmission in a wet market in china and now caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease covid-193 cheng et al

 here we describe early experience in a military setting in switzerland and the herein associated challenges the cases occurred in the canton of ticino which is the southernmost canton of switzerland and borders italys regions of piedmont and lombardy which are among the most heavily struck covid-19 regions in the world7 although severe disease is unlikely in the highly selected population of a recruit school8 management of logistical issues in this closed environment is highly challenging our aim is to emphasise how aggressive early management of disease can avoid general spread among the troops which can jeopardise any subsidiary engagement in supporting civil institutions and hospitals this is a retrospective cases series among members of the swiss armed forces maf during the covid-19 pandemic all members of the swiss armed forces provided informed consent for the study nasopharyngeal swabs from both nostrils was performed by an experienced otolaryngologist diagnosis of covid-19 was made after positive pcr for sars-cov-2 by the cantonal laboratory in bellinzona ticino switzerland quarantine was established for persons with close contact less than 2 m for more than 15 min in the last 48 hours before onset symptom of the covid-19 positive index patient for serological testing we used a commercially available immunochromatography rapid test with sars-cov-2 protein-specific igm and igg this test was performed according to the manufacturers instructions with a reported sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 95 respectively on 12 march 2020 a recruit presented at the military medical centre of monte ceneri ticino switzerland with headache dry cough and fever since the previous day his exposition and travel history were unremarkable expect for a skiing trip in the swiss alps during a permission 4 days before the patient patient 1 was isolated pcr testing from nasopharyngeal swab was positive for sars-cov-2 at the time it was the second positive case in the swiss armed forces the patient was treated symptomatically with acetaminophen and antitussive drugs quarantine was ordered for any person with a close contact with patient 1 a total of 55 mafs had to be quarantined for a total headcount of 140 of the concerned company a separate military barrack was requisitioned for the planned quarantine period of 5 days the 55 mafs were put in seven separate rooms a thermometer was provided to each room and a room deputy was responsible of reporting the health state of the roommates twice a day in the first day of the quarantine 13 march 2020 7 of 9 mafs in a particular single room developed flu-like symptoms such as coughing odynophagia weakness and slightly elevated temperatures pcr nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for all cases most of the symptomatic quarantined mafs showed rapid resolution of the symptoms without treatment except for two of them they showed persistent mild cough and slightly elevated temperatures nasopharyngeal swab was repeated on 17 march 2020 in these two patients one was positive for covid-19 patient 2 isolation of the entire room was ordered for 10 more days the maf in the other rooms did not show any symptoms and quarantine could be withheld after 120 hours both sars-cov-2 positive cases patients 1 and 2 showed a very mild disease patient 1 had fever for 2 days 388c and 381c patient 2 never developed fever after 2 days in patient 1 and 3 days in patient 2 symptoms of covid-19 disappeared completely after 2 and 3 days symptoms of covid-19 disappeared completely in patient 1 and 2 respectively seven days after initial diagnosis 20 march we repeated pcr testing of nasopharyngeal swabs both patient 1 and patient 2 were still positive although they had been completely asymptomatic and well for the past 5 and 4 days respectively interestingly patient 2 had very limited direct contact to patient 1 but they both had contact to a third person which remained asymptomatic the whole course of the quarantine and tested negative for sars-cov-2 although remaining unproven the third person was likely an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 carrier this patient may have been the link with patients 1 and 2 finally we performed serological test on isolated maf 14 days after patient 1 was diagnosed with covid-19 in patients 1 and 2 serological testing was positive for both igm and igg interestingly all other close contacts to our positive patients including the third suspected asymptomatic carrier tested negative the covid-19 epidemic is a rapidly spreading disease that is met with exceptional sanitary measures worldwide to limit its spread as illustrated in our case series limiting the spread of the disease has proven to be highly challenging for several reasons first hygiene measures such as hand washing social distancing and sneezing andor coughing in the elbow are basic measures that only show limited efficacy in the particular conditions of a recruit school and military barracks some of these measures are hardly feasible and impractical strict contact isolation is required it has been shown that viable sars-cov-2 on plastic surfaces can be present up to 72 hours after inoculation in experimental setting9 making contagion through door knobs and scale ramps very likely9 it is therefore paramount to ensure separate catering sanitation and lodging with increasing case and suspected numbers patients with sars-cov-2 and quarantined mafs it can become increasingly difficult to obtain appropriate facilities in a military environment as emergency solution we used tents to extend lodging capacity for quarantined mafs figures 13 our series shall emphasise the psychological burden during the time of quarantine and isolation10 although in the military setting we had the relative advantage of having to group mafs for logistical reasons which resulted in although isolated yet not lonely quarantine conditions second many young people are largely asymptomatic but may be sars-cov-2 carriers transmitting the disease11 estimates reach from 18 to at least 59 in some studies12 13 although fever and cough are described as the most common symptoms and sometimes deemed to be typical of covid-1914 it is very important to remember that in young adults symptomatology can be much milder and quite atypical our two patients showed a mild course disease with symptom resolution after few days but continued to be positive for sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs this finding underlies the importance of prolonged isolation to reduce further virus transmission as sars-cov-2 can still be proven in apparently healthy adults many days after symptom resolution15 this is also paramount for health workers to not underestimate as if they became infected the risk of further spreading the disease while willing to treat it is high15
 covert virus spreading also seems to occur during the preclinical inoculation period mean incubation time was reported to be 62 days range 214 with asymptomatic carriers before and after the clinical overt phase if any present16 in the preclinical phase it is important to separate any person with contact to a suspected or confirmed case on 20 march 2020 the swiss government increased quarantine time recommendations from 5 days up to 10 days our findings support this decision as it covers more accurately the incubation time for contacts however some slightly symptomatic carriers may test negative in pcr of nasopharyngeal swabs therefore it is important to time adequately swabs and to repeat them if clinical suspicion of covid-19 is present wang et al
17 described the highest sensitivity for pcr for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 93 followed by sputum 72 nasal swabs 63 and pharyngeal swabs 32 a combination of different or symptom-oriented swap localisation may be useful of note sars-cov-2 can also be transmitted by oralfaecal route with viral shedding proven in stool specimen of patients with covid-1917
 the relative lack of sensitivity of pcr especially in young and healthy population poses great challenges to epidemic control17 18 for that reason serological testing has gained great interest in the past weeks but still requires further validation19 in our case series none of the asymptomatic close contacts to patients 1 and 2 tested positive for pcr andor serology one possible explanation is that hygiene measures during quarantine and isolation were sufficient to avoid further spread however considering the high reproduction number of covid-19 a false-negative pcr from nasopharyngeal swab and false negative serology have to be considered for the latter a weak to mild symptomatology could explain the lack of detectable immune reaction20 finally negative serological testing might be linked to not yet fully validated technology19 how covert shedding of sars-cov-2 may be reduced in the future for example by prophylactic hydroxychloroquine21 remains unknown but is of great strategic interest for civil and military authorities young and healthy patients often show a mild course when infected with sars-cov-2 they may be before and after symptom presentation carriers and spreaders of sars-cov-2 this factor may lead to significant covert viral transmission an early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contact persons respectively is therefore essential to slow down sars-cov-2 epidemic growth especially in confined space conditions seen in a military setting  serological signatures of sars-cov-2 infection implications for

mueller michael white  background  the antibody response generated following infection with sars-cov-2 is expected to decline over time this may cause individuals with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection to test negative according to serological diagnostic tests in the months and years following symptom onset a multiplex serological assay was developed to measure igg and igm antibody responses to four sars-cov-2 spike s antigens spike trimeric ectodomain s tri  its receptor-binding domain rbd spike subunit 1 s1 and spike subunit 2 s2 antibody responses were measured in serum samples from patients in french hospitals with rt-qpcr confirmed infection n  259 and negative control serum samples collected before the start of the sars-cov-2 epidemic in 2019 n  335 the multiplex antibody data was used to train a random forests algorithm for classifying individuals with previous sars-cov-2 infection a mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the potential sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset igg antibody responses to one s antigen identified individuals with previous rt-qpcr confirmed sars-cov-2 infection with 903 sensitivity 95 confidence interval ci 861 934 and 991 specificity 95 ci 974 997 using a serological signature of igg to four antigens it was possible to identify infected individuals with 961 sensitivity 95 ci 930 979 and 991 specificity 95 ci 974 997 antibody responses to sars-cov-2 increase rapidly 1-2 weeks after symptom onset with antibody responses predicted to peak within 2-4 weeks informed by prior data from other coronaviruses one year following symptom onset antibody responses are predicted to decay by approximately 60 from the peak response depending on the selection of sero-positivity cutoff we estimate that the sensitivity of serological diagnostics may reduce to 56 -97 after six months and to 49 -93 after one year serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide more accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous sars-cov-2 infection changes in antibody levels over time may cause reductions in the sensitivity of serological diagnostics leading to an underestimation of sero-prevalence it is essential that data continue to be collected to evaluate this potential risk severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 since then it has spread rapidly with confirmed cases being recorded in nearly every country in the world the presence of viral infection can be directly detected via reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr rt-qpcr on samples from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs for individuals who display symptoms sars-cov-2 virus is detectable in the first 2-3 weeks following symptom onset 1 2  viral shedding is however shorter in mild cases with only upper respiratory tract symptoms 1-2 weeks 3  for asymptomatic individuals the duration for which sars-cov-2 virus can be detected is uncertain in most countries neither mild cases nor asymptomatic cases will be tested by rt-qpcr unless they are direct contacts of known cases and even among tested individuals many may be viremia negative at time of testing due to low viral load or improper sampling while not suitable for diagnosis of clinical cases serology is a promising tool for identifying individuals with previous infection by detecting antibodies generated in response to sars-cov-2 however the utility of serological testing depends on the kinetics of the anti-sars-cov-2 antibody response during and after infection an individual is sero-positive to a pathogen if they have detectable antibodies specific for that pathogen from an immunological perspective an individual can be defined as sero-positive if they have either antibody secreting plasma cells andor a matured memory b cell response to antigens on that pathogen in practice serological assays are used to measure antibody responses in blood samples however individuals who have never been infected with the target pathogen may have non-zero antibody responses due to cross-reactivity with other pathogens or background assay noise to account for this defining sero-positivity is reduced to determining whether the measured antibody responses is greater or lower than some defined cutoff value 4  the most fundamental measure of antibody level is via concentration in a sample eg in units of gml however a measurement in terms of molecular mass per volume is usually impossible to obtain instead a range of assays can provide measurements that are positively associated with the true antibody concentration eg an optical density from an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa or a median fluorescent intensity mfi from a luminex assay in contrast to the continuous measurement of antibody response provided by laboratory-based research assays most point-of-care serological tests provide a binary outcome sero-negative or sero-positive there are several commercially available tests for detecting sars-cov-2 antibody responses which are being catalogued by find diagnostics 5  these tests are typically based on lateral flow assays mounted in plastic cartridges which detect antibodies in small volume blood samples a key feature of many rapid tests is that they are dependent on the choice of sero-positivity cutoff and there may be substantial misclassification for antibody levels close to this cutoff antibody levels are not constant and change over time the early kinetics of the antibody response to sars-cov-2 have been well documented with a rapid rise in antibody levels occurring 5-15 days after symptom onset leading to seroconversion depending on the choice of cutoff 1 6 7 8 9

response assuming the antibody response is similar to that of other pathogens 10 11 12 13 14  we expect to observe a bi-phasic pattern of decay with rapid decay in the first 3-6 months after infection followed by a slower rate of decay notably this decay pattern may lead to sero-reversion whereby a previously sero-positive individual reverts to being seronegative if a serological test with an inappropriately high choice of cutoff is used for sars-cov-2 serological surveys there is a major risk that sero-reversion may lead to previously infected individuals testing sero-negative 15  the antibody response generated following sars-cov-2 infection is diverse consisting of multiple isotypes targeting several proteins on the virus surface including the spike protein and its receptor binding domain and the nucleoprotein 16  this complexity of biomarkers provides both a challenge and an opportunity for diagnostics research the challenge lies in selecting appropriate biomarkers and choosing between the increasing number of commercial assays many of which have not been extensively validated and may produce conflicting results the opportunity is that with multiple biomarkers it is possible to generate a serological signature of infection that is robust to how antibody levels change over time 17 18 19 20  rather than relying on classification of sero-positive individuals using a single cutoff antibody level in this analysis we apply mathematical models of antibody kinetics to serological data from the early stages of sars-cov-2 infection and predict the potential consequences

in their potential diagnostic performance there is also substantial between-individual variation in the antibody response generated following sars-cov-2 infection by measuring multiple biomarkers in large numbers of individuals it is possible to create a serological signature of previous infection 17 18 19  although necessarily more complex than a single measured antibody response such an approach has the potential of providing more accurate classification and being more stable over time the long-term kinetics of the antibody response to sars-cov-2 wont be definitively quantified until infected individuals are followed longitudinally for months and even years after rt-qpcr confirmed infection as of may 2020 the longest possible follow-up time after symptoms is four to five months as we wait for this data to be collected mathematical models can provide important insights into how sars-cov-2 antibody levels may change over time modelling beyond the timeframe for which we have data

predictions which will allow models to be updated as our team and others generate new data for the purpose of evaluation of antibody kinetics measured antibody responses from samples collected from individuals followed longitudinally after confirmed sars-cov-2 infection will be especially valuable the simulations presented here predict that following sars-cov-2 infection antibody responses will increase rapidly 1-2 weeks after symptom onset with antibody responses peaking within 2-4 weeks after this peak antibody responses are predicted to decline according to a bi-phasic pattern with rapid

proportion of infected individuals it is often impossible to have both high sensitivity and high specificity and we must select an appropriate trade-off for sero-surveillance of pathogens with low prevalence 20 we recommend prioritizing specificity for example if the true sero-prevalence of sars-cov-2 in a population is 8 a test with 100 sensitivity and 90 specificity would return an estimate of 1x8  01x92  172 a substantial over-estimate due to the potential problem of false positives we recommend aiming for a high specificity target of 99 however accurate validation of high sensitivity and high specificity serological diagnostic tests requires large number of samples many tests are validated on fewer than 100 samples 5  and this is not sufficient indeed the 594 samples used in this analysis is also arguably not sufficient ideally we would aim to validate on 1000 positive and 1000 negative samples furthermore it is important to avoid testing on homogenous panels of samples obtaining samples from multiple panels with different epidemiological backgrounds will contribute to more robust validation there are a large number of immunological assays capable of measuring the antibody response to sars-cov-2 including neutrilization assays elisa luminex luciferase immunoprecipitation system lips peptide microarrays and more 34  from the perspective of quantifying protective immunity and vaccine development functional approaches such as neutrilization assays are clearly preferable however from a surveillance and diagnostics perspective assays should be assessed in terms of their performance at classifying individuals with a previous rt-qpcr confirmed infection put simply if your wish is to diagnose someone you dont care what a biomarker does only that it can be reliably detected in previously infected individuals and not in uninfected individuals beyond diagnostics assessment of antibody kinetics may contribute to better understanding of the immune responses generated by sars-cov-2 vaccines statistical models can be used to identify immunological correlates of protection at least according to conditions such as the prentice criterion 35 36  an estimated correlate of protection may take the form of a dose-response relationship with higher antibody levels associated with greater vaccine efficacy under the assumption that a correlate of protection can be identified models of antibody kinetics can be used to provide preliminary estimates of the duration of protection following vaccination or natural infection 13 37  the analysis presented here is based on limited data and the predictions may subsequently be contradicted as more data become available however the concepts outlined here of serological signatures of sars-cov-2 infection generated by multiplex assays and mathematical models of antibody kinetics allow us to plan in advance for some of the future challenges that we may face in sars-cov-2 serological surveillance  cc-by-nc-nd 40

one year although a wide range of assays from elisa to micro-neutrilisation were used in the reviewed studies in this simple and approximate analysis we did not attempt to account for assay dependent

 several exceptions are worth noting one being influenza in which response to vaccination may complicate the serological diagnosis of infection in the current study 24 and 19 residents were diagnosed with influenza a and b respectively none of the subjects infected with influenza a showed antibody rises to influenza b and vice versa suggesting that antibody rises were not vaccine induced in addition vaccine effect was less likely because serum samples were obtained 7 to 9 months after immunization when vaccine induced antibody has typically decreased to near baseline
22
 another limitation of serology for viral diagnosis is the inability to identify rhinovirus rhinovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen that has been shown to cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in nursing homes but serological diagnosis is not possible because multiple serotypes exist
23
 because rhinoviruses are a frequent cause of the common cold it is not surprising that no association was found between uri and serological viral diagnosis presently there are limited data in elderly people on the newly described virus hmpv and its role as a cause of illness in ltcfs outbreaks of hmpv infection with significant morbidity and mortality in ltcfs have been reported in the united states canada and japan
16
 
24
 in each report diagnosis was made using rtpcr and the number of documented cases was small in this study hmpv was the most common infection diagnosed accounting for 24 of the documented viral infections asymptomatic serological infection has been described in 95 of young and 15 of elderly adults
9
 the clinical syndromes were not assessed in the current study and therefore the true effect of hmpv could not be assessed however the frequency of infection indicates that prospective studies of hmpv in ltcfs are needed similar to hmpv coronaviruses are difficult to detect using standard viral cultures thus few data are available on the effect of these viruses in longterm care in a prospective study of 11 nursing homes in the united kingdom using serology for diagnosis 11 of acute respiratory infections were due to coronavirus oc43 or 229e
18
 outbreaks of respiratory illness due to coronavirus oc43 mimicking influenza have also been described in nursing homes
25
 coronaviruses oc43 and 229e were common in the current study accounting for 6 and 11 of infections respectively two new strains of human coronaviruses have recently been identified nl63 and hku1 and will require further study to determine whether these viruses are also important pathogens in this population

 the current study demonstrates the complex nature of respiratory tract infections in ltcfs influenza infection was identified in 11 of residents which confirms the need for improved influenza vaccines in this population yet the broad range of other viruses circulating each year was impressive underscoring the importance of viralspecific diagnosis during outbreak investigations or clinical trials of vaccines or antivirals these data should provide useful information for those wishing to pursue clinical trials related to respiratory viral infections in nursing home populations  prevalence of igg and igm antibodies to sars-cov-2 among clinic staff and patients marcus asuquo inyama emmanuel effa akaninyene otu okokon ita ubong udoh victor umoh oluwabukola gbotosho anthonia ikpeme soter ameh william egbe margaret etok andrew ekpenyong jochen guck  the coronavirus disease 2019 is now a pandemic with devastating social and economic consequences the extent of the spread of covid-19 within populations is uncertain since diagnostic tests have not been carried out on all eligible persons and doing such diagnostic tests on everyone is much less feasible in developing countries such as nigeria tests for antibodies to sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 are more affordable readily available and require minimal training than current diagnostic tests employing a seroepidemiological strategy serological tests were conducted on 66 volunteering staff and patients at the university of calabar teaching hospital ucth a federal government owned tertiary healthcare facility to determine the extent of exposure to sars-cov-2 from 17 th to 25 th june 2020 using a covid-19 iggigm rapid test cassette with emergency use authorization eua from the food and drug administration fda of the united states it was observed that of the 66 samples tested 5 76 were both igg and igm positive and 17 26 were igg positive moreover for 44 of the 66 participants simultaneous tests were carried out using a rapid test kit from a different manufacturer but without fda-eua and all the results completely matched with the fda-eua kit except one case where the fda-eua kit showed positive for both igg and igm while the other kit was positive only for igm the 26 positive igg indicates a high exposure rate for the hospital staff and patients and points to community transmission where the facility is situated hence immediate activation of who guidelines for controlling community transmission is called for these results can further serve as a pilot study to guide public health policies in response to covid-19 pandemic in both the general population and in healthcare settings  the outbreak of the corona virus disease covid-19 caused by a novel virus called sars-cov-2 coronavirus 1-3 has led to a pandemic 4 that calls for both immediate and long term responses immediate responses have included large scale diagnostic testing using assays based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 5 6 7 8 rt-pcr carried out in laboratory settings on respiratory specimens as a nucleic acid amplification technique where rna is converted into dna and repeatedly multiplied for detection rt-pcr is currently the reference standard for diagnosis of covid-19 5 9  cheng and colleagues provide a narrative review of challenges surrounding diagnostic testing for sars-cov-2 challenges largely occasioned by the nature of rt-pcr 5  they note that many affluent countries have encountered problems with test kit contamination accuracy test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibited rapid increases in testing capacity and that such challenges are even greater in low resource settings 5  for instance access to the primers and other supplies in the detection workflow remains a serious drawback for a developing country such as nigeria furthermore variations in primers adopted by different pcr test kit producers can add to the issue of access for developing countries that rely on vendors from advanced economies for instance the who-backed assay has primer-probe sets that target the sars-cov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and envelope e genes 5 while the us uses its cdc-developed assay with pcr primer-probe sets for 2 regions of the viral nucleocapsid gene n1 and n2 and for the human rnase p gene 5 10  besides rt-pcr-based diagnostic tests which typically require special laboratory settings there are moderately complicated molecular based assays that are faster than rt-pcr and are aimed at point-of-care usage such as the abbott id now covid-19 abbott laboratories 11 12 and the xpert xpress sars-cov-2 test cepheid 13 both of which have received the us food and drug administration fda emergency use authorization the abbott id now covid-19 which can produce results in 5 minutes can also produce up to 15 false negatives 14 if viral transport media are added to samples highlighting a major limitation of current point-of-care molecular assays for sars-cov-2 clinical diagnosis at the lowest rung of the ladder of complexity for testing are antibodies or serologic tests serologic tests are carried out on clinical specimens such as blood saliva or even tears covid-19 serologic assays identify antibodies to sars-cov-2 such as iga igm and igg they are often based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays which are less complex than molecular tests 5  since they cannot rule out the presence of a virus serology tests are of limited value in the immediate clinical diagnosis of a patient with suspected covid-19 infection abbasi discusses both the promise and peril of antibody testing for covid-19 calling for more oversight from regulatory bodies such as the fda and cdc anchored on emerging scientific understanding of sars-cov-2 and the pathophysiology of covid-19 15  however positive results from validated antibody tests designed to be very specific to the sars-cov-2 virus can indicate whether a patient has covid-19 infection for igm antibodies or whether a patient has likely recovered from covid-19 infection for igg antibodies 16  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc indicates an important usefulness of serological tests which captures the essence of our work namely that serologic tests are helpful in understanding how many people have been infected or exposed and how far the pandemic has progressed 16  although still being studied and debated 17 owing to the novelty of covid-19 an advantage of serological tests for covid-19 is that the antibody tests could reflect immunity from covid-19 and guide decisions on when to relax social distancing measures another possible advantage is that the presence of antibodies in recovering patients may signal the clinical utility of appropriate convalescent plasma for treating infected patients 18  beyond possibilities compared to pcr and diagnostic molecular tests antibody tests are more affordable and require minimal training for use with about 4-7 fatality 23 and up to 20 hospitalization 2 in some countries the pandemic is a serious challenge to the human family and the economy immediate efforts to prevent or reduce transmission through non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing respiratory hygiene wearing of face masks social distancing ban on large gatherings border closures movement restrictions school closures partial lockdown and total lockdown have already occasioned dire socio-economic outcomes including job losses as well as disruptions in supply of essential needs thus immediate preventive containment and mitigation measures threaten to constitute solutions that are worse than the problem these put the society in a dilemma between saving lives and saving the means of livelihood this is where long term responses are called for as part of long-term response economically advanced countries such as germany and usa have already embarked on widespread random antibodies testing for the sars-cov-2 virus the us cdc has designed and validated a serologic test for broad-based surveillance and research that will provide information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the publics health 19  developing countries on the other hand face peculiar challenges in responding to covid-19 both immediately and in the long term 20  otu et al substantiate the question whether the african continent can play the long game of managing the combined public health and socio-economic impacts of covid-19 20  in a bid to gather information that will guide long term responses to covid-19 in sub-saharan africa we have embarked on a seroepidemiologic survey of communities and populations in cross river and akwa ibom states of nigeria beginning with this pilot study at a tertiary healthcare facility the university of calabar teaching hospital ucth the results we present here indicate community

matched except one case where the fda-eua kit showed positive for both igg and igm while the other kit was positive only for igm even for this one case since the detection of igm has the same

antibodies which implies that these individuals have either not been exposed to covid-19 or the tests were done too early following infection since it can take 1-3 weeks for antibodies to be developed following infection 15 21 with the median being day 13 22  although covid-19 antibody tests are not designed to be the sole basis for diagnosing active infection 23  validated test kits for the sars-cov-2 virus such as the fda-eua kit we used in our work can indicate acute ongoing or recent infection when the result is igm positive or both igm and igg positive thus with 5 samples of the 66 participants in our study being both igg and igm positive 76 there is evidence of ongoing infection in ucth and calabar even more worrisome epidemiologically is the fact that 17 of the 66 were igg positive 26 because that indicates recent covid-19 infection which means those participants have already spread the infection to others without knowing their statuscovid-19 igg antibodies remain in the blood after an infection has passed a serological testing for only igg antibodies among clinical staff in a healthcare setting in germany reported only 27 infection rate 24  a seroepidemiological study that combined pcr testing with antibody testing in a german community found 155 infection rate 5 times higher than the official pcr-only-based report of 31 for the same community 25  also using both pcr tests and iggigm antibody tests for cohorts of healthcare workers hospitalized patients and general workers in wuhan china it was found that igg prevalence was only 40 in healthcare providers and 46 in general workers 26  while direct comparisons may not be completely warranted owing to our modest sample number of 66 the trend of lower infection rate among healthcare workers compared to others in these reports 24 25 26 suggests that the infection rate in the community where ucth is situated may even be higher than the 26 we have found thus in spite of the relatively low case fatality rate in nigeria based on nigerias center for disease control ncdc data 27 which is about 2 our result indicates the urgent need for enhanced diagnostic testing contact tracing isolation of infected individuals and more drastic measures to contain the pandemic in the community this spurred us to bring these results of the pilot study to the public domain while continuing with the larger scale seroepidemiological survey importantly the combination of pcr testing with a serological survey presents some advantages that we highlight next in their vast review of current clinical practice and literature espejo et al 22 considered 55 recent reports on the use of serological testing and found that simultaneous iggigm measurements significantly adds sensitivity to rt-pcr testing protocols early post-onset of symptoms and becomes the most accurate diagnostic test at later time points 22  this is not surprising because rt-pcr sensitivity is subject to viral loads since it detects viral genetic material and in turn viral loads may depend on the time of testing following infection and on sample collection although it is the gold standard false negatives have been reported with rt-pcr especially in the first week of infection 28  a call for updated diagnostic clinical algorithm for covid-19 in settings such as nigeria where even rt-pcr is not always available for use during the most sensitive window for it is indeed  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

availability of rt-pcr and serological testing in such settings a good illustration of the utility of antibody testing in addition to pcr is the recent preliminary result for 3000 new yorkers randomly tested in which 139 were positive for coronavirus antibodies about 21 in new york city itself 30  revealing a rate of infection much higher than rt-pcr diagnostic counts thereby indicating a lower fatality rate for covid-19 this lower fatality rate also reported by many other countries based on antibody testing more clearly explains the association between co-morbidities and covid-19 fatality allowing resources to be better allocated for mitigation of comorbidities current standard diagnostic tests for covid-19 are relatively expensive and challenging to carry out on entire populations even in advanced economies the testing rate is crucial to interpreting case reports from various countries unless the testing rate is substantially increased immediate responses to covid-19 in nigeria will remain inadequate and poorly informed with poorly informed containment and mitigation strategies long term responses are in even greater jeopardy while the problem of knowing who is infected and who is not remains to be addressed through dedicated diagnostic testing we have used serological testing as an easier means of addressing the question to what extent has covid-19 spread within a healthcare setting and within the community our preliminary results revealing 1766 26 igg positive and 566 76 igm positive populations in ucth a tertiary health care facility call for more diagnostic testing and more serological surveys of the general population in cross river state and beyond as part of measures to contain covid-19 pandemic
