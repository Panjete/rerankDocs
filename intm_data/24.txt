diabetes and novel coronavirus infection implications for treatment video mp4 1633936 kbcoronaviruses have been implicated as a cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections since the isolation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 in guangdong china in 2002 1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in saudi arabia in 2012 2 coronaviruses are enveloped positive single-stranded rna viruses which originated in bats indeed both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov were transmitted initially to humans from market civets and dromedary camels respectively 3 in humans sars-cov-1 infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor and mers-cov utilises the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 receptor to infect both unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes 3more recently a novel coronavirus subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was isolated in wuhan china in december 2019 which causes the disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 4 subsequently a worldwide pandemic has resulted with over 55 million people infected and almost 350000 deaths in 188 countries at the time of writing 5 notably sars-cov-2 also appears to infect ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes predominantly via the ace2 receptor and is structurally similar to the sars-cov-1 6 akin to previous coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov-2 likely originated from the bat and the outbreak was initiated from animal-to-human transmission in markets in which wild animals were sold 4 7whilst the prevalence of diabetes in people infected with sars-cov-2 is relatively low compared to the population prevalence of diabetes in chinese and italian cohorts 8 9 people with diabetes appear to develop more severe forms of the disease data from the uk suggest that a diagnosis of diabetes is a major risk factor for hospital admission in people with covid-19 as 19 of 16749 patients hospitalised with covid-19 between february and april 2020 had underlying diabetes 10 see table 1 indeed one-third of all people dying from covid-19 in the uk had an underlying diagnosis of diabetes regrettably the odds of in-hospital death in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes t2d was 286 and 181 compared to people without diabetes after adjusting for confounding variables 11 moreover at the time of writing an underlying diagnosis of diabetes is the commonest underlying health condition amongst those who have died of covid-19 in the uk 12people with diabetes infected with sars-cov-2 in china and italy have also required greater use of intensive care unit icu support andor mechanical ventilation and have had a higher mortality rate than people without diabetes 13 indeed studies from both the usa and china report that diabetes is an independent predictor of death in people with covid-19 and that mortality is up to 50 higher in this patient population than in people without diabetes 14 moreover a recently published analysis of people with diabetes hospitalised for covid-19 in france found that 290 of people attained a primary outcome measure of mechanical ventilation andor death within 7 days of hospitalisation with covid-19 interestingly the authors of this study reported that high body mass index was independently associated with the primary outcome 15 in fact around 40 of people hospitalised with covid-19 in the usa had underlying diabetes or hyperglycaemia with a more than fourfold greater mortality than those who did not 16 therefore it would appear that diabetes may act as a marker for poor metabolic health that in turn increases the risk of severe disease in those infected with sars-cov-2 as several other high-risk medical conditions are associated with diabetes including hypertension obesity ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal diseasethere is undoubtedly an increased mortality in people with diabetes and covid-19 possibly due to the association of conditions with poor outcomes in covid-19 such as hypertension ischaemic heart disease and obesity 17 which are commonly observed in people with diabetes see fig 1 therefore the mortality association may be confounded by this relationship however considerable biology links poor outcomes and higher mortality in people with diabetes and covid-19 in this review we discuss the likely biological interactions between diabetes and covid-19 and the potential impact of diabetes medications on covid-19 severity and health outcomesthis article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authorsdiabetes is associated with poorer health outcomes as a result of its multi-system involvement and association with multiple cardiovascular renal and other comorbidities making it a leading cause of death worldwide 18 diabetes results in an inflammatory condition in which hyperglycaemia triggers the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in oxidative stress and thereby tissue inflammation moreover diabetes is associated with a relative immunodeficiency as a result of impaired macrophage and neutrophil function reduced lymphocyte proliferation and complement activation dysfunction 19 as a result of this pro-inflammatory and immunodeficient state higher morbidity and mortality has previously been associated with several bacterial and viral infections in people with diabetes 18 20 predictably uncontrolled glycaemia was previously associated with worse outcomes in people with diabetes during both the sars-cov-1 21 and mers-cov 22 disease outbreaks however there remains debate on whether hyperglycaemia acts to exacerbate the infection or is simply a consequence of the stress response that results from coronavirus infectionowing to the high prevalence of people with diabetes and covid-19 requiring hospitalisation andor icu support there must be more specific mechanisms which affect people with diabetes infected with sars-cov-2 14 given our understanding of the mechanism of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov we review the potential role of ace2 and dpp-4 receptors in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 in people with diabetes
the ace2 receptor is widely expressed within the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract tubular epithelial cells of the renal tract mucosal cells of the gastrointestinal tract arterial and venous endothelial cells cardiac myocytes and the pancreatic -cells 17 23 within the respiratory system ace2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin i and therefore inhibition of ace2 leads to elevated concentrations of angiotensin ii thereby generating a pro-inflammatory response and stimulating aldosterone secretion collectively these actions enhance local vascular permeability and renal fluid retention thus engendering respiratory distress 24 sars-cov-2 enters the host cell utilising the envelope spike glycoprotein on its surface to bind the ace2 enzyme which in turn modulates the enzymes activity potentiating cell damage and respiratory failure 25 consequently hypokalaemia has been noted as a feature of people who are critically ill from covid-19 and is believed to be a result of renal potassium wasting from excess aldosterone secretion moreover early normalisation of serum potassium is a predictor of an improved prognosis in people who are critically unwell with covid-19 26 interestingly one recent study concluded that sars-cov-2 may cause acute kidney injury via the ace2 receptor as the virus was detected within human glomerular cells at autopsy 27in people with diabetes hyperglycaemia in the earlier stages of covid-19 may worsen disease outcomes as hyperglycaemia induces the glycosylation of the ace2 receptor promoting cellular linkage to the sars-cov-2 virus and therefore promoting infection of the host cell and causing a higher disease severity 28 moreover early correction of hyperglycaemia can reverse this process and may improve disease outcomes leading many authors to argue a case for tight glycaemic control as a priority in the care for people with diabetes who have covid-19 17 2931 in addition to enhanced ace2 receptor glycosylation upregulation of ace2 receptor expression may enhance the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter and infect the host cell as a result there are safety concerns surrounding the use of many medications which are commonly used in people with diabetes including ace inhibitors angiotensin-receptor blockers ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones all of which appear to increase the expression of ace2 17 nevertheless little evidence currently supports their discontinuation in routine practice and current guidance supports continuation of these medications 17 32 however further study into the possibly harmful effect of such frequently utilised medications in people with diabetes and cardiovascular disease is warranted 33
genetic analyses of the ace2 gene provide further explanation for the poorer health outcomes seen in people with covid-19 and diabetes the ace2 enzyme is expressed by the ace2 gene on the x chromosome 34 interestingly expression of ace2 has been linked with the development of t2d and the expression of the single nucleotide polymorphism g8790a on the ace2 gene also increases the risk of developing t2d 35 36 theoretically an increased expression of ace2 or specific ace2 polymorphisms may result in greater disease severity by increased binding potential with the sars-cov-2 virus one study observed that asian men had greater expression of ace2 than their white or african american counterparts 37 implying that this may explain some of the population differences observed in covid-19 severity additionally cao and colleagues observed that east asian populations had higher ace2 receptor tissue expression which again may explain differences in susceptibility or response to sars-cov-2 38 however further investigation into this potential risk factor is warranted 33 and may lead to further therapeutic targetsfurther interest in the role of ace2 in people with diabetes comes from studies identifying this receptor in pancreatic -cells 39 recent observations of greater incidence rates of diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported in people with or without an underlying diagnosis of diabetes and are associated with a high mortality rate 40 diabetic ketoacidosis in this setting likely results from the destruction of pancreatic -cells following sars-cov-2 entry into the cell via the ace2 receptor indeed people with insulin-treated diabetes and covid-19 appear to have greater insulin resistance and require significantly higher insulin doses 14 this may simply reflect the severity of infection inducing a considerable catecholamine response which generates greater insulin resistance or it is a direct mechanism in which sars-cov-2 further impairs -cell function the latter argument is supported by a previous study conducted during the sars-cov-1 outbreak which observed that approximately 50 of non-diabetic patients with sars-cov-1 infection developed diabetes as an inpatient although only 5 of participants had diabetes at follow-up 3 years later the authors reason that as sars-cov-1 binds to the ace2 receptor in the pancreatic -cells the resulting damage to the islet cells impairs insulin release 39 it is this relative hypoinsulinaemia that is thought to be the cause of the higher incidence of hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients 40 as a result many argue that tighter blood glucose control is essential and will improve health outcomes in people with diabetes 17 2931the interest in dpp-4 receptors started with the finding that the mers-cov virus targeted this receptor to enter and subsequently infect a host cell 14 and that antibodies directed against dpp-4 inhibit the infection of host cells by the mers-cov virus 41 of course the dpp-4 enzyme plays a critical role in glucose metabolism by degrading incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide resulting in reduced insulin secretion 42 however dpp-4 also known as cluster of differentiation-26 cd26 plays an additional immunomodulatory role by activating t cells and maintaining lymphocyte function 43 recent studies have observed that the dpp-4cd26 molecule also interacts with the s1 domain of the sars-cov-2 viral spike glycoprotein 44 in addition to the initially reported interaction with the ace2 receptor 6 moreover there are structural similarities between sars-cov-2 and the mers-cov and sars-cov-1 viruses 4 44 however results are mixed and other studies do not support an interaction between sars-cov-2 and cells expressing dpp-4 but only to cells expressing ace2 45 nevertheless there remains a potential role for dpp-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with covid-19 leading some to call for further studies to explore this potential therapeutic avenue 46 47drugs within this class of medication inhibit the sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 sglt-2 protein in the proximal convoluted tubule thereby preventing the reuptake of both sodium and glucose to promote their urinary excretion 48 use of these medications is associated with significant improvements in glycaemic control body weight and reduced progression of renal disease 49 50 since their introduction in 2013 their prescribing usage has increased dramatically and they are amongst the most commonly used drugs for treating t2d 51there is strong rationale for the use of sglt-2 inhibitors as a potential treatment for people with covid-19 firstly the use of these medications promotes diuresis and natriuresis which improves heart failure outcomes 52 53 additionally their use appears to selectively reduce interstitial fluid volume without significantly affecting the intravascular fluid volume 54 collectively these actions may improve covid-19 health outcomes because as discussed above covid-19 locally increases vascular permeability within the lung thereby increasing interstitial fluid volume and consequently inducing respiratory distress 24 secondly the use of sglt-2 inhibitors is associated with a shift in myocardial and renal metabolism from carbohydrate andor lipids to ketones which are more energy-efficient and may improve both myocardial and renal function 55 thirdly sglt-2 inhibitors are also believed to exert an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing serum leptin tumour necrosis factor-alpha tnf- and interleukin 6 il-6 levels but increasing serum adiponectin level 56 given the pro-inflammatory state associated with diabetes 19 reducing such inflammatory markers may result in improved morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 indeed the use of sglt-2 inhibitors appears to be associated with favourable cardiovascular and general health outcomes making them an attractive therapeutic option in people with diabetes and covid-19as a result studies to establish whether these drugs improve covid-19 outcomes in people with or without diabetes would be important the dare-19 trial is a phase iii randomised double-blind and placebo-controlled trial which aims to establish whether dapagliflozin 10 mg reduces disease progression complications andor all-cause mortality in people with covid-19 57 interestingly not all of the study participants will have a diagnosis of diabetes but there is a requirement of a diagnosis of either hypertension t2d atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease heart failure or chronic renal disease to participate 57 we are unaware of other clinical trials investigating the use of these medications at the time of writinghowever there are some major concerns surrounding the use of sglt-2 inhibitors in people with diabetes and covid-19 such concerns are due to the increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with the use of sglt-2 inhibitors as a result of increased urinary glucose excretion with reversal of the insulinglucagon ratio which then precipitates ketosis 58 given the increased risk of ketoacidosis in people with covid-19 discussed above there is therefore potential for harm associated with the use of sglt-2 inhibitors and the current recommendation is to withhold these drugs during illness in keeping with sick day rules 14 59 moreover sglt-2 inhibitors promote renal ace2 activity and thus there is potential that the use of these medications may promote sars-cov-2 infectivity 60 however there are no trials to date which demonstrate this and further data are required we await the outcome of the dare-19 trial with anticipation to further investigate the benefits and potential risks associated with the use of dapagliflozinas discussed above there is considerable interest in the dpp-4 receptor as a therapeutic target in people with covid-19 as a result of its potential interaction with this receptor to infect a host cell 44 whilst there is no currently available clinical data to support this some studies are underway to examine the impact of dpp-4 inhibition on covid-19 outcomes in people with diabetes the aim of an observational retrospective casecontrol study in italy is to compare clinical and biochemical outcomes in people with diabetes treated with the dpp-4 inhibitor sitagliptin to people with diabetes not treated with sitagliptin 61 the objective of a randomised open-label trial is to compare measures of glycaemic control inflammation and chest x-ray findings between insulin-treated patients with t2d with or without the dpp-4 inhibitor linagliptin 62 at the time of writing no further clinical trials on dpp-4 inhibitors were foundglucagon-like peptide-1 is an endogenous peptide secreted by the distal small bowel in response to glucose ingestion to stimulate insulin release from the -cells of the pancreas and is subsequently degraded by the dpp-4 enzyme glp-1 analogues act directly to stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion and are associated with improved glycaemic control body weight and reduced progression of renal disease 49 50glp-1 analogues may interact with the covid-19 disease process through two key processes upregulation of ace2 receptors and anti-inflammatory effects in rats use of the glp-1 analogue liraglutide was associated with upregulation of ace2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary system 63 and the liver 64 secondly the use of glp-1 analogues is known to improve metabolic health generally at least partly through reducing endovascular inflammation 65 indeed one pre-clinical trial found that use of liraglutide in rats was associated with reduced inflammatory measures including macrophage infiltration and reduced tnf- and il-6 levels 66 however there is a paucity of evidence from human studies in this area 60 and we are not aware of any ongoing trials examining the potential impact of these medications of covid-19 outcomes at the time of writing this reviewcovid-19 is a worldwide pandemic which has resulted in an extraordinary number of infections and deaths worldwide people with diabetes are particularly vulnerable to develop more severe forms of the disease possibly due to a clustering of risk factors such as hypertension ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal disease common pathways appear to exist that may explain the susceptibility of this patient population to covid-19 and some medications commonly used for people with diabetes may interact with these pathways however little is known to date on whether these interactions lead to clinical harm or benefit or indeed whether they have any impact at all although a recent analysis of people with diabetes hospitalised in france with covid-19 demonstrated no association with the need for mechanical ventilation or death within 7 days with glucose-lowering therapies such as metformin and insulin 15 safe trials exploring such medications are welcomed and we hope these will shed light on this rapidly evolving area in a time of great uncertainty whilst we continue to rapidly learn more about this novel diseasefrom january 2020 we have been facing an unprecedented outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which has now become a global catastrophe data from the early months of 2020 suggest that most people with covid-19 have comorbidities the most prevalent of which are diabetes cardiovascular disease and hypertension1 a significant association with worse outcomes is seen in people with these comorbidities1 studies have also shown that covid-19 is associated with hyperglycaemia particularly in the elderly with type 2 diabetes2 in view of many uncertainties with covid-19 a faculty of representatives from primary and specialist care have developed a consensus document on the management of diabetes for people at risk of or with confirmed covid-19 for use in both primary and specialist care the brief practical recommendations authored by this group were convened virtually the recommendations are based on queries that have been emphasised to be important by clinicians questions that have been raised by colleagues and social media and recommendations guided by using focused-literature review clinical decision making in the management of diabetes is already complex and in normal circumstances we recommend clinicians follow guidelines for management of people with diabetes however the recommendations authored by our group add to the existing guidelines by considering specific points for the management of patients with diabetes and covid-19 disease or at risk for metabolic diseasediabetes is a primary risk factor for the development of severe pneumonia and a septic course due to virus infections and occurs in around 20 of patients3 4 diabetes was identified as a major contributor to disease severity and mortality in middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov5 evidence from epidemiological observations in regions heavily affected by sars-cov-2 and reports from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and other national health centres and hospitals showed that the risk of a fatal outcome from covid-19 is up to 50 higher in patients with diabetes than in those who do not have diabetes6 there are several hypotheses to explain the increased incidence and severity of covid-19 infection in people with diabetes in general people with all forms of diabetes are at increased risk of infection because of defects in innate immunity affecting phagocytosis neutrophil chemotaxis and cell-mediated immunity however the high frequency of diabetes in serious cases of covid-19 could potentially reflect the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in older people furthermore diabetes in older age is associated with cardiovascular disease which in itself could help to explain the association with fatal outcomes of covid-19there are at least two specific mechanisms that might play a role in covid-19 infection first to gain entry to its target cells the sars-cov-2 virus hijacks an endocrine pathway that plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation metabolism and inflammation7 angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as the receptor for the coronavirus spike protein ace2 has protective effects primarily regarding inflammation covid-19 infection reduces ace2 expression inducing cellular damage hyperinflammation and respiratory failure7 acute hyperglycaemia has been shown to upregulate ace2 expression on cells which might facilitate viral cell entry however chronic hyperglycaemia is known to downregulate ace2 expression making the cells vulnerable to the inflammatory and damaging effect of the virus furthermore the expression of ace2 on pancreatic  cells can lead to a direct effect on  cell function8 9 10 although these findings have not been verified in humans they suggest that diabetes might not only be a risk factor for a severe form of covid-19 disease but also that infection could induce new onset diabetes8 9 10 potential  cell damage caused by the virus leading to insulin deficiency is supported by the observation of italian colleagues and co-authors of these recommendations who have reported frequent cases of severe diabetic ketoacidosis dka at the time of hospital admission another important observation by the co-authors from various centres in different countries affected by covid-19 is the tremendous insulin requirement in patients with a severe course of the infection to what extent covid-19 plays a direct role in this high insulin resistance is unclear according to the personal experiences of co-authors of this personal view the extent of insulin resistance in patients with diabetes seems disproportionate compared with critical illness caused by other conditionsa second potential mechanism that might explain the link between covid-19 and diabetes involves the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 enzyme which is commonly targeted pharmacologically in people with type 2 diabetes in cell studies dpp-4 was identified as a functional receptor for human coronavirus-erasmus medical center hcov-emc the virus responsible for mers11 antibodies directed against dpp-4 inhibited hcov-emc infection of primary cells dpp-4 enzyme is an ubiquitously expressed type ii transmembrane glycoprotein it plays a major role in glucose and insulin metabolism but also increases inflammation in type 2 diabetes12 whether these mechanisms also apply to covid-19 and whether diabetes treatment with dpp-4 inhibitors in clinical practice influences the course of the infection is currently unknown but if these mechanisms translate to sars-cov-2 the use of these agents could reduce dpp-4 concentrations and could provide therapeutic opportunities for treatment of covid-1912
people with diabetes who have not yet been infected with the sars-cov-2 virus should intensify their metabolic control as needed as means of primary prevention of covid-19 disease this includes continuation and strict abidance with adequate control of blood pressure and lipids wherever possible remote consultations using connected health models should be utilised to reduce exposure they should also be encouraged to follow general advice from who the cdc and state and local governments about hand washing and physical distancingall patients without diabetes and particularly when at high risk for metabolic disease who have contracted the viral infection need to be monitored for new onset diabetes that might be triggered by the virus all patients with covid-19 disease and diabetes require continuous and reliable glycaemic control as suggested in the flowchartmost patients with type 2 diabetes have other components of the metabolic syndrome including hypertension and dyslipidaemia therefore continuation with an appropriate antihypertensive and lipid-lowering regimen in all these patients is of crucial importancetreatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers could increase the expression of ace2 which could accelerate the entry of the virus into the cells13 however as sars-cov-2 might impair the protective ace2mas receptor pathway and increase deleterious angiotensin-2 activity the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers could protect against severe lung injury following infection on the basis of currently available evidence we recommend that patients should continue with their antihypertensive regimens including ace inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptors this view is endorsed by a recent position statement from the european society of cardiology and the heart failure society of america american college of cardiology american heart association who strongly recommended continuation of treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers14
statins have been shown to restore the reduction of ace2 induced by high lipids such as low density lipoprotein or lipoproteina15 the pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects of statins have been attributed to the upregulation of ace2 however although we believe that modulation of ace2 expression is associated with both infection and mortality rates in covid-19 statins should not be discontinued because of the long-term benefits and the potential for tipping the balance towards a cytokine storm by rebound rises in interleukinil-6 and il-1 if they were to be discontinued given the close links between diabetes and cardiovascular disease we recommend control of lipid concentrations in all patients with covid-19there are certain subgroups of people with diabetes who might require specific consideration elevated hemoglobin a1c in people with type 1 diabetes compromises immune function rendering them more susceptible to any infectious disease these individuals will need more intense monitoring and supportive therapy to reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation including dka in particular for those taking sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors sglt2 according to the expertise from the co-authors an increase in the prevalence of severe dka in covid-19 positive patients with established type 1 diabetes has been observed but this might in part be because of delayed hospital admission thus making patients with type 1 diabetes aware of this complication and re-educating them about typical symptoms home-measurement of urine or blood ketones acute behaviour guidelines and liberal and early inquiry of professional medical advice and sick day rules is crucial patients who have undergone transplantation of islets pancreas or kidney or those on immunosuppressive therapy will be at particularly increased risk additionally the potential effect of coronavirus infection on pancreatic function in this group is unknown and monitoring for a recurrence of insulin requirement in those who are insulin independent after their transplant is importantthe increasing number of patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant fatty liver disease will probably have an increased risk for a more pronounced inflammatory response including the so-called cytokine storm and these patients should be considered at increased risk of severe covid-19 disease therefore screening for hyperinflammation using laboratory trends eg increasing ferritin decreasing platelet counts high-sensitivity c-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate are of crucial importance and might also help to identify subgroups of patients for whom immunosuppression steroids immunoglobulins selective cytokine blockade could improve the outcomethe majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are living with conditions of overweight or obesity body mass index is an important determinant of lung volume respiratory mechanics and oxygenation during mechanical ventilation especially in the supine position therefore patients with obesity and diabetes could be at specific risk of ventilatory failure and complications during mechanical ventilation clinical experience with young patients with obesity and covid-19 supports this notion furthermore individuals with obesity or with diabetes have an altered innate and adaptive immune response characterised by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation with higher concentrations of the pro-inflammatory leptin and lower anti-inflammatory adiponectin16 additionally obesity is often associated with physical inactivity leading to aggravated insulin resistance this condition per se impairs immune response against microbial agents including macrophage activation and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to a dysregulation of the immune response contributing to complications associated with obesity17
furthermore sars-cov-2 can induce long-term metabolic alterations in patients who have been infected with the virus as has been reported previously with the sars virus18 therefore a careful cardiometabolic monitoring of patients who have survived severe covid-19 disease might be necessaryimportantly we should also bring attention to the subgroup of people with diabetes who work as health-care professionals given that covid-19 might be more prevalent among the sick than is currently being diagnosed health-care professionals with diabetes should be deployed away from front line clinical duties where possible for cases in which this is not possible or desirable high-grade protection or increased protection should be usedprovision of elective surgical proceduresincluding metabolic surgeryis being postponed in many hospitals around the world to increase capacity for in-patient beds and acute care however postponing elective metabolic surgery during the outbreak of covid-19 is advisable regardless of issues of hospital capacity patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity are at increased risk of complications of covid-1917 compounding the potential negative influence of surgical stress in the recovery period furthermore although specific data are not available there are plausible concerns that pneumoperitoneum and the use of haemostatic instruments during laparoscopy by far the most common approach used in metabolic surgery because of its ability to reduce morbidity and mortality might lead to viral aerosolisation thus increasing the risk of transmission of the virus to both patients and staffwhether patients with type 2 diabetes who have had metabolic surgery will be protected from adverse outcomes of covid-19 relative to their peers who have not undergone surgical treatment simply because of better glycaemic control remains unclear19 however metabolic surgery could induce nutritional deficiencies including reduced absorption of vitamins and micronutrients which play important roles in the regulation of the immune and stress response20 although there are no data yet to suggest that patients who had metabolic surgery are at greater risk of infection or complications from covid-19 these patients should receive particular attention and close monitoringalthough optimising glycaemic control to reduce the risk of severe covid-19 disease is important specific considerations around treatment modality should be made panel lactic acidosis associated with metformin or euglycaemic or moderate hyperglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis associated with sglt-2 inhibitors are rare events however we recommend these drugs should be discontinued for patients with severe symptoms of covid-19 to reduce the risk of acute metabolic decompensation21 importantly discontinuing these drugs is not recommended prophylactically for out-patients with diabetes without any symptoms of infection or in the absence of evidence for a serious course of covid-19 furthermore at present no convincing evidence exists to suggest that dpp-4 inhibitors should be discontinued further analyses on affected patients with various diabetes treatments and covid-19 could allow elucidation of the effects of dpp-4 inhibitors12 importantly if drugs are discontinued the alternative treatment of choicein cases for which this option is feasibleis insulin21
given the multiple stresses associated with covid-19 including but not limited to respiratory failure the defects in insulin secretion and the frequent occurrence of diarrhoea and sepsis most patients will require insulin and especially since many cases are reported with very high insulin consumption this will need to be managed by intravenous infusion22 considerable care is required in fluid balance as there is a risk that excess fluid can exacerbate pulmonary oedema in the severely inflamed lung furthermore potassium balance needs to be considered carefully in the context of insulin treatment as hypokalaemia is a common feature in covid-19 possibly associated with hyperaldosteronism induced by high concentrations of angiotensin 2 and could be exacerbated following initiation of insulin22
we do realise that all our recommendations and reflections are based on our expert opinion awaiting the outcome of randomised clinical trials executing clinical trials under challenging circumstances has been proven feasible during the covid-19 pandemic and trial networks to provide evidence-based therapies are arising23 investigating subgroups with diabetes and how these relate to covid-19 outcomes will be important in particular investigating if some of the various management approaches would be particularly effective in managing diabetes in a covid-19 context24

dear siras of todays reports the global number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has surpassed 150000 the number of known cases is increasing by several thousand every day on march 11 2020 who publicly characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the issue is of serious concern and deserves momentous attentioncoronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses most of them cause illness in animals but seven known types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 is one of those viruses  it causes the illness currently known as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19though we are still learning what exactly puts someone at greater risk of developing a severe illness with covid-19 early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases may be at higher risk 1 2 3 infection caused by covid-19 is likely to disturb metabolic regulation diabetic patients with covid-19 may face an altered immune response on the background of an already compromised health status owing to the diabetes-related complications andor agingthe most important findings in patients with hyperglycemia and a viral infection were significant worsening of symptoms which implies greater morbidity in these patients when compared to those without diabetes 3 however the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain it is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism what we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection and this can impact on glucose metabolism 4 dm is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid carbohydrate and protein profiles 5 such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products ages activates macrophages and other cells of the immune system increase oxidative stress and promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines besides stimulating the synthesis of adhesion molecules that facilitate inflammation in the tissues 5 the inflammatory process and its complications might provide a higher propensity to infections or a greater severity of these conditions another important issue is how this inflammatory and immune response occur in diabetic patients who acquire a viral infection as well as whether the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or the glycemic controlat this stage the biological mechanism of the relationship between covid-19 and diabetes is not known but the association for the severity of cases and death is pronounced we need to develop a hypothesis to explain the causal path underlying the more severe clinical presentation of covid-19 infection and subsequent death in diabetic patients biochemical tests are also essential to clarify the molecular pathophysiology involvedthe association of covid-19 and dm is of substantial public health importance and deserves proper attention since a large and diverse population is being affected globally nowadays this comorbidity poses a relevant threat to human health and prospective well-designed studies to elucidate the biological mechanism and the best clinical management of this association are urgently neededhomephilipphiliphomenewcastleacuktranslational and clinical research institute the medical school framlington place newcastle upon tyne ne20 9hu ukdear sirit was very useful to see the review published in the journal on diabetes and covid 19 infection 6 in it you highlight that people with diabetes have a death rate perhaps around four times that of the background population and i note that it has been suggested over 20-40  of deaths in chinawuhan were in people with diabetes 78 clearly it is important to understand whythere will be some confounders here in the form of associations with other risk factors for dying with a covid-19 infection notably age and cardiovascular disease but these cannot explain all the excess we need to

condition in which excess fluid in the alveoli blocks gas exchange between air and bloodpeople with diabetes and many with cardiovascular disease cvd without diabetes have a very permeable vasculature

guptariteshfortis cdoc hospital chirag enclaverenin angiotensin system blockade and covid-19 diseasedear editorwe recently published an article highlighting the special concerns while managing patients with diabetes in the times of covid-19 pandemic11 there have been some concerns about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs which were not clarified in our publication12 we are summarising the current evidence in this regard and will try to arrive at a reasonable conclusionin the absence of a vaccine and an antiviral drug for the covid-19 infection several therapeutic approaches are being studied one such approach is the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system namely ace inhibitors and arbs on the other hand some concern has been raised about the fact that patients on these agents might be at an increased risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 is the receptor for sars cov-2 as well as other coronaviruses and is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and endothelium the s-glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus binds to ace2 this leads to a conformational change in the s-glycoprotein and allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases tmprss2 ultimately leading to internalization of the virion13 viral s-glycoprotein tmprss2 and ace-2 inhibition are potential targets of therapy and possibly vaccine developmentas ace-2 is essential to coronavirus infection its blockade is thought to be beneficial in preventingtreating this infection a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors14 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan15 as far as cvid-19 infection is concerned the data on ras activation or the effect of its blockade is limited at present hypokalaemia could be a marker of ras activation and high incidence of hypokalaemia has been reported in patients with covid-19 infection16despite these small studies suggesting the benefit of drugs acting on ras there is some data albeit scarce from animal models and human studies that treatment with ace inhibitors and arb could cause up regulation of ace217 ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones have also been shown to do the same18

19 increased expression of ace2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however currently there is no evidence to support this hypothesis in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension and european society of hypertension20

coronaviruses covs are enveloped viruses with a positive single-stranded rna virus which are widely distributed in humans and animals to cause respiratory infections in humans 1 nowadays the ongoing pandemic of covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is an emerging rapidly evolving situation 2 as of april 14 2020 1924626 cases and 119625 deaths in total have been confirmed around the world suggesting that the overall death rate of covid-19 was 62 although sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share similarities in phylogeny and clinical trials the new type of coronavirus seems to have a higher spread and lower mortality 3 a study reported that sars-cov-2 invades into the cells through its predicated receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 4 blocking the renin-angiotensin system can prevent new-onset diabetes and reduce the risk of diabetes complications 5 du et al 6 found that the elderly who are over 65 years old showed higher risk of suffering from the disease especially those with severe complications and patients who had experience of entering the intensive care unit icu than those who did not this finding indicated that complications may be a risk factor for adverse consequences a recent meta-analysis reported that hypertension diabetes copd cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with covid-19 but the impact of these risk factors on covid-19 mortality has not been explored 7 therefore this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and covid-19 analyze if diabetes patients infected with sars-cov-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence this result may help the government formulate prevention policies and respond to the outbreak of covid-19 ultimately contributing to the better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetesthe preferred reporting items for meta-analyses prisma guidelines were used we determined to include studies involving in covid-19 sars-cov-2 or diabetes to find relevant primitive articles we performed a comprehensive retrieval in databases involving medline via pubmed embase and web of science with the following words covid-19 sars-cov-2 wuhan virus chinese virus novel coronavirus novel coronavirus 2019 2019 ncov wuhan coronavirus wuhan pneumonia the 2019 coronavirus died non-survivors death survival survivors and alive papers were searched in the databases until april 14 2020 with no restrictions of language we also reviewed reference lists based on the recognized literature to find additional eligible studies we first screened both titles and abstracts of the articles and publications which may involve in data concerning covid-19 sars-cov-2 or diabetesprimitive studies were carefully examined and there were no nation restrictions in our study the inclusion criteria were as follows 1 all studies reporting data on covid-19 non-survivors survivors and laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients 2 studies limited to mankind contained original data published in english and appeared in the form of either abstract or full-text the exclusion criteria were as follows 1 duplicate studies letters case reports abstracts or reviews 2 research focusing on morbidity rather than mortality we collected the following information from each study publication year first authors name sample size age for both dead group and alive groupwe assessed the quality of each involved research by the newcastleottawa scale 8 meta-analysis was conducted via review manager 53 by calculating the i2 index to evaluate the heterogeneity the i2 values of  25 2550 5075 and 75100 were considered as homogeneous low moderate and high heterogeneous levels respectively if the i2 value was  50 the random effects model rem would be applied if the i2 value was  50 the fixed effects model fem would be applied the pooled odds ratios ors of different studies and corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis were used to estimate the relationship between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19 then the sensitivity analysis was repeated with the impact of each study evaluated by deleting different individual studies each timea total of 597 potentially relevant articles were identified using our search strategy from databases and 1 from reference lists four hundred and sixty studies remained after ruling out duplicates after screening the titles and abstracts 347 research articles that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria were ruled out after scanning the main body of the reserving 13 records another seven articles were excluded finally nine qualified articles met the eligibility criteria 917 the steps of document retrieval are shown in fig 1 meanwhile the common characteristic of included studies is listed in table 1 the meta-analysis involved 926 cases 260 dead and 666 alive overall that were all published in 2020 one study 9 reported the settings in icu and isolation wards all articles are of high quality because nos score was no less than 6the outcome of the forest plot for the connection between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19 is shown in fig 2 our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of covid-19 with a pooled or of 175 95 ci 131236 p  00002 the pooled data were calculated with the fem as no heterogeneity appeared in the studieswe chose age as the subgroup and there was no significant difference between age  70 subgroup and age  70 subgroup and the or was 133 95 ci 078228 p  030 and 205 95 ci 144294 p  0001 respectively in fig 3 as a result of insufficient data the impact of age stratification on mortality of covid-19 should be further carried out meanwhile our study demonstrated no heterogeneity i2  5 and upon eliminating the impact of yuans study and wangs study the results significantly affected the pooled outcomes i2 dropped from 5 to 0 therefore we assumed that the studies of yuan et al and wang et al may be the sources of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis the sensitivity analysis results showed that the ors ranged from 150 95 ci 101223 to 203 95 ci 129320 the risk of publication bias was analyzed by beggs test p  009 and eggers regression test p  036 indicating no significant publication bias in our meta-analysisour meta-analysis suggested that the mortality of patients with covid-19 was significantly related to diabetes with or of 175 95 ci 131236 p  00002 meanwhile the value of i2  5 i2  50 p  001 indicated that no heterogeneity exists in the studies in addition sensitivity analysis revealed that when excluding any single study or rem was converted to fem the total outcomes still held so we are confident in the validity of the data obtained in our study showing a powerful correlation between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19despite the unclear pathophysiology it has been observed that the most severe and fatal cases of covid-19 occur in the elderly or patients with potential complications especially those with diabetes 18 according to the reports diabetes and high blood glucose levels are important predictors of the severity and death of patients infected with different viruses involving sars-cov and mers-cov 19 20 a study found elderly patients with chronic diseases including diabetes were at higher risk of severe covid-19 infection and death 21 insulin resistance promotes synthesis of end-glycosylation products and stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines oxidative stress and adhesion molecules resulting in a higher likelihood of infection and worse prognosis 22infection leads to destruction of pancreatic beta cells decreased pancreatic insulin content and changes in the hosts ability to respond normally to glucose tolerance tests 23 a previous study suggested that sars coronavirus uses ace2 as a receptor to enter and damage islet cells that cause acute diabetes 24 until now there was no relevant study exploring the role of ace2 in covid-19 diabetic patients a recent meta-analysis retrieved the data of 2108 chinese patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection and found the prevalence of diabetes is 103 25 but until now no meta-analysis has explored the possible mortality between diabetes and covid-19 therefore our meta-analysis results found a significant relationship between diabetes and mortality covid-19 with a pooled or of 170 95 ci 116248 p  0006 which may contribute to better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetescompared with younger patients patients aged 65 and over showed higher risk of initial complications more severe symptoms and were more prone to multiple organ involvement and death 12 similarly feng et al 26 recruited 476 covid-19 patients from three different cities in china and the survival rate of patients over 75 years old was significantly lower than that of young patients factors leading to poor health include physiological changes in aging and multiple age-related complications a study held the opinion that older peoples suspicion and detection threshold for sars-2 should be lower such as temperature the decline in pulmonary function and shortness of breath 27 management began with the diagnosis and classification of the elderly in order to achieve an appropriate level of care simultaneously our age subgroup analysis results indicated that there was no significant difference between age  70 subgroup and age  70 subgroup however if we chose the threshold for age stratification as 65 years old in the age  65 subgroup the or would be 173 95 ci 128234 p  00003 so more research on the impact of age stratification on mortality of covid-19 diabetic patients should be carried outthis is the first attempt to use meta-analysis to prove whether the mortality of patients with covid-19 is related to diabetes at the same time our study has some limitations first due to the inadequate data we do not have access to information such as diabetes duration time of diagnoses diabetes type diabetes medications and complications and thus we cannot conduct risk stratification in the subgroup analysis within the diabetic population second we only obtained the information regarding the age and gender of covid-19 patients but other factors might influence the accuracy of results such as bmi 28 measurements and instruments for the detection of sars-cov-2 meanwhile the populations included in our study were mainly in asian populations and so these conclusions even if important cannot be extended automatically to caucasian or other populations finally the patients who are diagnosed with covid-19 may have multiple chronic diseases simultaneously such as hypertension cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease and copd which may affect the accuracy of the results meanwhile the samples are not quite enough and more large-scale studies are neededour meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with covid-19 these results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the covid-19 patients more importantly this meta-analysis grades the reliability of evidence for further basic and clinical research into the diabetes dysfunction in covid-19 patientsdear siras of todays reports the global number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has surpassed 150000 the number of known cases is increasing by several thousand every day on march 11 2020 who publicly characterized covid-19 as a pandemic the issue is of serious concern and deserves momentous attentioncoronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses most of them cause illness in animals but seven known types of coronaviruses cause illness in humans the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 is one of those viruses  it causes the illness currently known as coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19though we are still learning what exactly puts someone at greater risk of developing a severe illness with covid-19 early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions such as hypertension diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases may be at higher risk 1 2 3 infection caused by covid-19 is likely to disturb metabolic regulation diabetic patients with covid-19 may face an altered immune response on the background of an already compromised health status owing to the diabetes-related complications andor agingthe most important findings in patients with hyperglycemia and a viral infection were significant worsening of symptoms which implies greater morbidity in these patients when compared to those without diabetes 3 however the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain it is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism what we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection and this can impact on glucose metabolism 4 dm is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid carbohydrate and protein profiles 5 such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products ages activates macrophages and other cells of the immune system increase oxidative stress and promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines besides stimulating the synthesis of adhesion molecules that facilitate inflammation in the tissues 5 the inflammatory process and its complications might provide a higher propensity to infections or a greater severity of these conditions another important issue is how this inflammatory and immune response occur in diabetic patients who acquire a viral infection as well as whether the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or the glycemic controlat this stage the biological mechanism of the relationship between covid-19 and diabetes is not known but the association for the severity of cases and death is pronounced we need to develop a hypothesis to explain the causal path underlying the more severe clinical presentation of covid-19 infection and subsequent death in diabetic patients biochemical tests are also essential to clarify the molecular pathophysiology involvedthe association of covid-19 and dm is of substantial public health importance and deserves proper attention since a large and diverse population is being affected globally nowadays this comorbidity poses a relevant threat to human health and prospective well-designed studies to elucidate the biological mechanism and the best clinical management of this association are urgently neededhomephilipphiliphomenewcastleacuktranslational and clinical research

chinawuhan were in people with diabetes 78 clearly it is important to understand whythere will be some confounders here in the form of associations with other risk factors for dying with a covid-19

after clusters of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in early december 2019 and then rapid spreading of sars-cov-2 was occurred throughout the globe at present as of june 12 2020 7273958 confirmed cases including 413372 deaths have been reported across 216 countries 1 after a huge outbreak occurred on february 20 2020 as a result of a super-spreading event within a religious group in daegu in southern south korea 12003 confirmed cases and 277 deaths have been reported in south korea as of june 12 2020 2 although the fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused by middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-cov the absolute number of fatalities as a result of covid-19 is extremely high because of the high prevalence of covid-19 3 the severity of disease varies from asymptomatic infection to mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure multi-organ dysfunction and death although a large majority of cases are mild some are severe and fatalmany people with covid-19 have comorbidities such as diabetes cardiovascular disease and hypertension 456 diabetic patients have been strongly suggested to have more severe outcomes and higher mortality due to covid-19 than those without diabetes 7 thus the diabetic community urgently needs to know about covid-19 and its effects on patients with diabetes and special precautions should be taken in their management during the covid-19 pandemic this report aims to describe the association between diabetes and covid-19 and provides the official suggestions of the korean diabetes association kda for the covid-19 outbreakpeople with diabetes are at an increased risk of serious infection 8 diabetes was identified as a major contributor to disease severity and fatality in h1n1 pandemic influenza virus infection and mers 910currently most available data come from hospitalized cohorts with a reported prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 ranging from 53 to 264 worldwide 5111213141516171819 a small number of nationwide studies are available a recent population-based cohort study using the korean health insurance review and assessment service hira data among 5307 covid-19 patients 770 145 had diabetes in korea unpublished data data from studies across china estimated the population prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 patients to be approximately 53 to 11 which is not higher than the prevalence of diabetes in the general population 720 according to the report from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of united states 109 of covid-19 patients have diabetes 21 to summarize these reports diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities of covid-19 infection it is still unclear whether people with diabetes are more susceptible to covid-19 infectionthe disease severity and mortality in patients with diabetes were higher than those in patients without diabetes among those with covid-19 in several studies a two-center retrospective study performed at hospitals in wuhan showed a higher proportion of intensive care unit icu admissions 176 vs 78 p001 and more fatal cases 203 vs 105 p0017 were identified in covid-19 patients with diabetes than in sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes 22 another retrospective multi-center study of 7337 cases of covid-19 in china found subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus required more medical interventions and had a significantly higher mortality 78 vs 27 adjusted hazard ratio hr 149 than non-diabetic individuals 23 in a single-center study conducted in korea mortality was significantly higher in patients with diabetes 172 than in those without diabetes 12 19 a study based on the nationwide surveillance data among 63 fatal cases of covid-19 365 were found to have diabetes in korea 6 according to a nationwide population-based cohort study conducted in korea the prevalence of diabetes among covid-19 patients who were hospitalized received oxygen supply applied mechanical ventilator and who died were 147 281 413 and 446 respectively unpublished data a meta-analysis of 6452 patients from 30 studies also showed that diabetes was associated with composite poor outcomes including mortality severe covid-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards need for icu care and disease progression risk ratio 238 188 to 303 p0001 i262 7 these results suggest an association between diabetes and poor prognosis and increased mortality of covid-19 publications that have investigated the association between diabetes and severity in patients with covid-19 are shown fig 1there are several suggested mechanisms that might play a role in an association between diabetes and covid-19 fig 2 uncontrolled hyperglycemia was reported as a significant predictor of severity and fatality of different viral diseases including sars-cov 2009 pandemic influenza and 2012 mers-cov infection 910 in an observational study conducted in france long-term glycemic control as assessed using glycosylated hemoglobin hba1c was not associated with covid-19 severity 24 although admission plasma glucose was significantly associated with the primary outcome tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and death within 7 days of admission in age and sex-adjusted nonlinear models it was not a predictor of the severity of covid 19 in multivariable models 24 hba1c was also not a predictor of covid 19 severity in a single center study in korea 19 a retrospective multi-center study conducted in china showed that well-controlled blood glucose as assessed using glycemic variability was associated with markedly lower mortality than in individuals with poorly controlled blood glucose adjusted hr 014 during hospitalization after adjusting for age sex covid-19 severity comorbidities and side effects in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus 23 a single center study from italy reported that the group treated with insulin infusion had better glycemic control and less severe covid-19 25 these findings provide clinical evidence that uncontrolled hyperglycemia during hospitalization is associated with poor outcomes in covid-19 patients with diabetes prospective controlled studies are needed to clarify the effect of hyperglycemia on the prognosis of covid-19diabetes might be associated with immune system impairment and may affect the inflammatory response to pathogens poorly controlled diabetes is linked to inhibited lymphocyte proliferative responses to different stimuli 26 and impaired macrophage and neutrophil functions 27 furthermore bactericidal activity following stimulation is decreased and bacterial phagocytosis and killing mechanisms are reduced in diabetic patients 28 it was demonstrated that the respiratory burst of monocytes in patients with poorly controlled disease with hyperglycemia was severely impaired when compared to that in patients with well-controlled disease and healthy people 29 influenza virus infection and replication were significantly increased when pulmonary epithelial cells were exposed to high glucose concentrations 30low-grade chronic inflammation is a common feature in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus c-reactive protein crp a well-established marker of the development of inflammation tumor necrosis factor  an inflammatory marker and interleukin 6 are strongly associated with diabetes 31 cytokines play a key role in promoting atherosclerosis and therefore cardiovascular disease 32 interestingly ards in patients with covid-19 is driven by severe hypoxemia despite relatively well-preserved lung mechanics 33 a pre-existing proinflammatory state could accentuate the hyper-inflammatory response cytokine storm which is believed to be responsible for ards as well as multi-organ dysfunction in covid-19 34comorbidities of diabetes might cause more susceptibility of covid-19 in diabetic patients common demographics and comorbidities of diabetes such as older age male sex cardiovascular disease hypertension and obesity have been associated with poor outcomes in covid-19 1135 a retrospective single-center study conducted in korea reported that age was an independent risk factor for severe outcomes in patients with diabetes 19 in a study assessing the prognostic value of clinical and biological features age microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications treated obstructive sleep apnea dyspnea increased aspartate transaminase and crp and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate and platelet count were independently associated with the risk of early death in patients with diabetes hospitalized for covid-19 24 obesity is also known as an independent risk factor of severity in covid-19 patients 36angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein which is an important element in the regulation of blood pressure metabolism and inflammation was also identified as the receptor for the coronavirus spike protein sars-cov-2 enters the cell by binding to ace2 37 there is experimental evidence for the downregulation of ace2 in diabetes 38 which might reduce the entry of the virus into cells furthermore ace2 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells sars-cov-2 might enter islets cells and cause beta-cell dysfunction 39 on the other hand ace2 has been suggested to have a protective effect against inflammation-induced damage ang-17 formed from angii by ace2 exerts inhibitory effects on inflammation and on vascular and cellular growth mechanisms by acting via the mas receptor 40 downregulation of ace2 in diabetes might make cells vulnerable to inflammation following viral infectiondipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 inhibitors are one of the most frequently used medications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from in vitro experiments dpp-4 was identified as a functional receptor for mers-cov for its entry into the cell 41 antibodies directed against dpp-4 inhibited mers-cov infection of primary cells 42 dpp-4 may also have a role as an entry route for sars-cov-2 although it is not proven yet in vitro treatment of dpp-4 inhibitors did not block the entry of coronavirus into cells 42 on the other hand the dpp-4 enzyme is known to be involved in the immune system and increases inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus 43 whether the dpp-4 enzyme also plays a role in the association between diabetes and covid-19 is currently unknownbased on mounting evidence supporting the effect of proper glycemic control on the prognosis of covid-19 intensified glycemic control is recommended in covid-19 patients with diabetes infection with sars-cov-2 might trigger stress conditions and increased secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol and catecholamines which result in the elevation of blood glucose and extreme glycemic excursion in practice cases of acute hyperglycemic crisis were reported in covid-19 patients with diabetes 4445 there was a case report of the successful management of high-risk patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis using telehealth 46 it is thought that during the pandemic when health providers or diabetic patients are required to minimize contact and may even be quarantined telehealth could provide alternative support in preventing acute complications and controlling sever hyperglycemia people with diabetes who are not infected with the sars-cov-2 are also recommended to maintain optimal glycemic control as part of the primary prevention of covid-19 covid-19 patients without diabetes need to be monitored for new onset diabetes viral infection can trigger the onset of diabetes and 28 of covid-19 patients with hyperglycemia had not been diagnosed as having diabetes before hospitalization in a single center study 25 also during covid-19 pandemic social distancing decrease of attendances to hospital facilities limited access for patients and remote consultations are easy to miss the urgent situations of diabetic complications such as diabetic foot acute coronary syndrome severe diabetic retinopathy and so on therefore doctors healthcare providers and patients need to be alert with regards to development and deterioration of diabetic complicationsmetformin is recommended as the first-line treatment of choice and one of the most frequently prescribed medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus metformin is contraindicated in people with concomitant sepsis or severe impairment of hepatic and renal function as covid-19 patients are vulnerable to dehydration and multi-organ failure patients should follow the sick day rule and metformin should be stopped if severe renal or hepatic dysfunction is confirmed careful monitoring of renal function is needed during illness euglycemic ketoacidosis is rarely reported in type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 sglt-2 inhibitor sglt2 inhibitors should be discontinued for patients with renal dysfunction or severe sars-cov-2 infection who are dehydrated and have a risk of ketoacidosis however prophylactic discontinuation of these medications is not recommended for patients with mild symptoms or without any symptomsorgan failure as previously described a dpp-4 inhibitor was suggested to have a protective role against mers 42 there is a lack of evidence of sars-cov2 binding to dpp-4 dpp-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists may exert anti-inflammatory actions in human subjects and have been successfully used to control glucose levels in hospitalized patients 43 a study using korean national insurance claim data analyzed 832 confirmed covid-19 subjects with dm and showed that use of a dpp-4 inhibitor is associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 47 however whether dpp-4 inhibitors influence the course of the covid-19 remains unclear insufficient secretion of insulin as a result of beta cell dysfunction can develop in patients with multiple stresses triggered by covid-19 for intensive glucose control the use of insulin is feasible treatment with insulin infusion showed better glycemic control and less severe covid-19 in a retrospective study 25 because of the possibility of extreme blood excursion in patients with severe covid-19 the risk of hypoglycemia should be carefully monitored with insulin use good glycemic control is important in improving the outcomes of patients with covid-19 anti-diabetic medications that effectively control blood glucose should have a beneficial effect on covid-19 prognosis some anti-diabetic medications are suggested to have immune-modulating effects expected to have additional benefits but neither of them has been proven yet larger cohort studies are needed to prove specific anti-diabetic medication is beneficial independent of glycemic control in covid-19 patientsregarding the association between covid-19 and ace2 an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection due to elevated expression of ace2 in patients treated with ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs has been hypothesized there is controversy over whether renin-angiotensin aldosterone system raas inhibitors are harmful or protective with respect to covid-19 a positive test for covid-19 or in the risk of severe covid-19 were not increased in who patients take raas inhibitors 48 a retrospective single-center study conducted in korea also showed that use of arb or ace inhibitor medications was not associated with a critical outcome but showed protective effects against acute cardiac injury odds ratio or 0048 p005 in diabetic patients with covid-19 19 a study from korea using national insurance claim data also showed no effect of raas blockade on clinical outcomes in covid-19 in patients with diabetes 47 in a meta-analysis of 12 studies involving more than 19000 covid-19 cases raas inhibitor exposure was not associated with a higher risk of covid-19 among those with covid-19 infection raas inhibitor exposure was also not associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes or mortality on the contrary raas inhibitor exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to those on non-raas inhibitor antihypertensive drugs or 048 95 confidence interval ci 029 to 081 p0006 49 it is strongly recommended that patients who are taking ace inhibitors or arbs should not withdraw their current treatment regimens because of covid-19as there is the possibility for patients with diabetes a typically immunosuppressive condition to develop serious covid-19 the kda would like to make some official suggestions regarding the covid-19 epidemiological emergencythe kda suggests that patients with diabetes particularly those over 70 years old should have the opportunity to be tested and hospitalized when symptoms are first detected in this situation when nationwide spread is already suspected beyond local infection preferential screening and hospitalization of high risk groups such as elderly patients with diabetes who can progress to a serious condition will decrease the entire death toll and the number of deaths in the aged older population this should prevent the development of serious illness which would be an efficient response to covid-19the kda also provides covid-19 prevention guidelines for patients with diabetes table 1 people with diabetes and health providers should be aware that they are more likely to develop serious illness than otherwise healthy people and follow strict prevention guidelines in particular patients with diabetes aged over 70 years are a high-risk group and require special care the more difficult the situation is the more important it is to measure blood sugar closely and strictly maintain life style the kda suggests refraining from going out or visiting crowded areas ensuring good hand washing maintaining cough etiquette avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands putting on a mask before visiting a medical institution and avoiding contacting someone with fever or respiratory symptoms the kda also recommends avoiding personal contact at home as much as possible and always wiping frequently touched surfaces such as tables doorknob and keyboard for blood sugar management the kda suggests taking oral medications and administering insulin more strictly than usual and self-monitoring blood sugar more frequently self-monitoring of blood sugar should be performed at least twice a day after waking up in the morning and once 2 hours after meals if the result is consistently higher than usual patients should visit their doctor or use the phone helpline proper nutrition therapy is also important sugar consumption should be limited regular three meals and balanced diet are essential sufficient vegetable and protein consumption is also recommended the kda also recommends drinking plenty of water to prevent infection exercise is necessary in order to maintain immunity a certain amount minimum 30 minutes of regular aerobic exercise is recommended every day at home regular resistance exercises are also recommended at least twice a week contacting the community healthcare center is needed if there are any symptoms such as a cough phlegm or fever immediate contact with a doctor is also needed when blood sugar levels reveal a sudden and consistent increase if it is difficult to visit a doctor consult through the phone helpline allowed temporarilyclose attention and timely adequate care are essential for the prevention and proper treatment of covid-19 in diabetic patients expanding our knowledge about covid-19 developing medications for sars-cov-2 infection and conducting studies for identifying unanswered questions about the pathogenic pathway risk factors and effects of anti-diabetic medications on covid-19 outcomes and the best practice for managing diabetes during pandemic are essential for the future another infectious disease pandemic we have to prepare nationwide remote monitoring and couching system for diabetic patients as soon as possible the kda will spare no effort in closely cooperating with health authorities for patients with diabetes to overcome the current difficulties related to covid-19coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an emergency public health incident happening in nearly 190 countries and regions and affecting more than 1 279 722 patients worldwide with 72 614 deaths as of 7 april 2020 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causes symptoms in the majority of cases the most common being fever cough shortness of breath fatigue and muscle pain 2 high-resolution computed tomography ct allows accurate evaluation of lung lesions thus enabling us to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease 3 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure sepsis acute cardiac injury and heart failure have been the most common critical complications during the exacerbation of covid-19 4table 1
a growing body of evidence suggests the notable impact of comorbidities of chronic diseases on the clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 infection according to coronavirus reports from the centers for disease control and prevention of the us department of health  human services patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome may have up to 10 times greater risk of death when infected with covid-19 5 in 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients from 575 hospitals 399 251 reported having at least one comorbidity 6 the most prevalent comorbidity of covid-19 was hypertension 169 followed by diabetes 82 this report has drawn considerable attention to on covid-19 coexisting disorders patients the presence of coexisting illness was found to be more common among severe patients 7 covid-19 patients have underlying risk factors associated with mortality including male gender advanced age and the presence of comorbidities including hypertension diabetes mellitus cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases 8 the major comorbidities in fatality cases include hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease cerebral infarction and chronic bronchitis 9 it is notable that diabetes has been demonstrated as a potential risk factor in close association with mortality 10covid-19 places a huge burden on healthcare facilities especially regarding patients with comorbidities the intensive care was required for approximately 20 of polymorbid covid-19-infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a case fatality rate cfr greater than 13 11 special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children healthcare providers and elderly people 12 given the higher mortality and higher proportion of critically ill adult covid-19 patients with diabetes good in-patient glycemic control is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of covid-19 individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to the specific circumstances of covid-19 patients with diabetes 13 14in our recent meta-analysis which included 1936 covid-19 patients in nine studies covid-19 was significantly correlated with several metabolic diseases indicating that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease may exert a profound effect on the progression of covid-19 15 the adverse effects of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders on the immune system make patients more vulnerable to various infections however more evidence for the worsening of covid-19 patients with diabetes compared with non-diabetes is required for these conclusions to be consolidatedto elucidate the risk and severity of comorbidity in diabetes patients infected with covid-19 a retrospective study was carried out to investigate the clinical features radiographic and laboratory tests complications treatments and clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients with or without diabeteswe included 208 hospitalized patients  45 years old with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from the hubei provincial hospital of integrated traditional chinese and western medicine between 12 january 2020 and 25 march 2020 covid-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the world health organization whos interim guidance a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens a total of 96 diabetic and 112 non-diabetic patients were randomly selectedinformation on recent exposure history clinical symptoms or signs and laboratory findings on admission was extracted from electronic medical records we determined the presence of radiologic abnormality on the basis of the documentation or description in medical charts a major disagreement between two reviewers was resolved by consultation with a third reviewer laboratory assessments consisted of the following a complete blood count blood glucose and lipids coagulation testing assessment of liver and renal function measures of electrolytes c-reactive protein procalcitonin pct lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase blood gas analysis and detection of inflammation markerswe divided the cases into two groups a group for patients with covid-19 and type 2 diabetes based on the guidelines for the prevention and control of type 2 diabetes in china 2017 edition
16 and a group for covid-19 patients without diabetes all medical data were processed by a team of experienced clinicians who reviewed and abstracted the data data were entered into a computerized database and checked if core data were missing requests for clarification were sent to the coordinators who subsequently contacted the attending clinicianslaboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 was performed at the hubei provincial hospital of integrated chinese and western medicine rt-pcr assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the whocategorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages and continuous variables were described using mean median and interquartile range iqr values the means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t-tests when the data were normally distributed otherwise the mann-whitney u test was used proportions for categorical variables were compared using the

 in the 201 ct scans that were performed at the time of admission 904 showed abnormal results no ct abnormality was found in seven of the 111 patients 63 without diabetes and in six of the 90 patients 67 with diabetes the most common patterns in the chest cts were ground-glass opacity 856 vs 649 p  0001 and bilateral patchy shadowing 767 vs 378 p  0001 among diabetic patients in comparison with non-diabetic patients which is consistent with other recent reports 2 that suggest more severe lung injury in diabetic covid-19 patients

diabetic patients and 35 non-diabetic patients were given glucocorticoids accounting for 350 of all non-diabetic patients p  0121 according to a retrospective study the patients with ards from covid-19 showed lower mortality among those receiving glucocorticoids 22 covid-19 patients can benefit from glucocorticoids treatment to reduce autoimmunity and cytokine toxicity 23in this retrospective study blood glucose was not monitored in every covid-19 patient after treatment with glucocorticoids due to outbreak isolation management therefore we could not analyze the impact of glucocorticoids on the glucose level of covid-19 patients with and without diabetes due to insufficient clinical data this is a limitation of the study although glucocorticoids unavoidably affect the blood glucose level there is no evidence that the administration of glucocorticoids worsens covid-19 in the future the influence of glucocorticoids on covid-19 patients with diabetes will be further investigatedthis retrospective study provides the first direct evidence supporting the high frequency of the coexistence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension coronary heart disease and chronic renal disease in patients with covid-19 this new finding strongly supports our proposed novel concept of glucolipid metabolic disease glmd and an integrated strategy for the treatment of the whole spectrum of metabolic diseases underlying sars-cov-2 infection 24 it has been recognized that disorders in the metabolism of glucose and lipids act as the initial trigger and as a potent driving force in the development and progress of various metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hypertension atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications as the metabolism of lipids and glucose is a highly coordinated process under both physiological and diseased conditions impairment in the signals corresponding to the metabolism of either lipids or glucose is not only a common mechanism but also the key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of glmd 25another novel finding in the present study is the potentiated severity in covid-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities although several previous studies have reported on diabetes as one of the most common comorbidities in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 7 26 27 the pathophysiological consequence of the close association between diabetes and covid-19 progression still remains elusive our analysis highlights the markedly promoted morbidity in diabetes patients with covid-19 infection the frequency and degree of abnormalities in radiologic examinations of diabetic covid-19 patients were notably higher than those in the control group without diabetes in addition disruption in the homeostatic control of glucose metabolism and blood pressure was more severe in diabetic covid-19 patients diabetes and its related metabolic disorders have consistently been documented as one of the key risk factors for severe outcomes in patients infected with other types of coronavirus such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 28 29 and sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov 30 thus our data in the present study demonstrate that diabetes and its associated metabolic complications are a crucial contributor to enhanced morbidity and mortality in covid-19 patientsthe conceptional construction of glmd has great relevance to the clinical management of covid-19 on the one hand our data suggest that maintenance of the homeostasis in glucose and lipid metabolism via optimal clinical management in covid-19 patients is mandatory furthermore evidence from infection with another member of the coronavirus familynamely sars-covhas demonstrated that the binding of sars-cov to its receptor ace2 in the pancreas results in islet damage and a notable decrease in the release of insulin thereby causing short-term hyperglycemia and even the onset of diabetes 31 furthermore sars-cov-evoked diabetes-like traits markedly potentiate the progression to multiple-organ failure via a positive feedback loop therefore tight control of the parameter set of glucose and lipid metabolism may be the key to optimal clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients without a history of diabetes andor other metabolic diseases on the other hand diabetes has attained epidemic proportions worldwide according to estimated data from the international diabetes federation 415 million people have diabetes mellitus with 90 of these individuals having type 2 diabetes mellitus 32 hence powerful and integrated approaches should be launched for the comprehensive prevention of glmd which is of significant importance for marked reduction in the morbidity and mortality caused by covid-19 and other emerging infectious diseasesthe present study may possess limitations first this retrospective study was conducted on historical cohorts with all recorded events having already occurred thus information on relevant risk factors with potentially profound influence on the progression of covid-19 may not be included in the database and subsequent analysis therefore the measurement of the impact of diabetes and its complications on the clinical outcomes would not have been as accurate as in a prospective study second the sample size is relatively small therefore the findings observed in the present study warrant further validation through future study with a large sampling sizein conclusion diabetes and other coexisting metabolic disorders within the spectrum of glmd significantly boost the morbidity in covid-19 patients therefore these findings deliver at least two important messages for the clinical management of covid-19 first optimal management of the metabolic hemostasis of glucose and lipids is key in ensuring better clinical outcomes second increased clinical vigilance is warranted for covid-19 patients with glmd in the form of fundamental and chronic conditionsalthough criticism has been levelled concerning the transparency of the early coronavirus epidemic experience in china several preliminary clinical and epidemiological papers summarised in a recent practical diabetes editorial

 reports that 355 of patients dying from covid19 infection had diabetes compared to a matched population prevalence of 203 while in preliminary estimates from the usa
11
 based on data from 122653 persons with confirmed covid19 disease diabetes proved to be the most significant medical comorbidity 109 of total 24 of those hospitalised and 32 of those admitted to the icuso far data for the uk are limited however the office of national statistics has reported
12
 that in england and wales 91 of those dying from covid19 infection had at least one preexisting condition including diabetes more specifically statistics from nhs england
13
 for the period 31 march to 12 may 2020 record that of 22332 covid19 deaths in hospital 5873 26 had diabetes a comparable proportion to new york city with diabetes identified in 25 of patients hospitalised with covid19 infection
14

parallels have been drawn between this current coronavirus pandemic and the global spanish influenza pandemic of 100 years ago but the concept of managing comorbidities other than postwar malnutrition would not have been foremost in mind at that time diabetes was however very much a consideration with the swine flu pandemic of 2009 when contingency planning and management guidelines were issued
15
 
16
 even then it was recognised that people with diabetes were potentially six times more likely to require hospitalisation during an influenza epidemic
17

however circumstances are different now with no natural innate covid19 immunity in the population and a preventative vaccination programme yet to be developed recognising that some people may be more seriously vulnerable to infection the uk government identified certain groups primarily those with potential immune deficiency or with severe respiratory conditions and advised that they selfisolate at home for 12 weeks although diabetes was not included in this list people with diabetes have nonetheless been encouraged to take particular care with precautionary measures such as social distancing and relative selfisolationthe principles of diabetes management with infection remain relevant sickday rules under these circumstances people with diabetes may well feel anxious with concerns about their diabetes control availability of medical supplies and their access to expert advice guidance for people with diabetes has been made available online from organisations such as diabetes uk18 and jdrf
19
 and similarly for health care professionals from specialist bodies including the association of british clinical diabetologists

 the us endocrine society jointly with the university of leeds
21
 and an international perspective from the national diabetes foundation of india
22
 the latest 19 march 2020 clinical guide for the management of people with diabetes during the coronavirus pandemic has been issued jointly from the royal college of physicians abcd and the nhs
23
 while a national diabetes inpatient covid response team has provided advice
24
 on maintaining essential elements of the diabetes service and collating shared experience to learn from these unprecedented circumstanceseducation programmes in selfmanagement especially what to do in the event of acute illness should be returning the desired dividend but specialist advice must continue to be available for people in difficulties with their diabetes control for instance immediate facility will need to be in place to initiate insulin therapy for those with type 2 diabetes previously bordering on the edge of acceptable control on maximum oral hypoglycaemic agents with the swine flu pandemic a five to 10fold increase in new case insulin demand was anticipated and it has to be assumed the same need will arise with this pandemic important data to be analysed in due courseat the time of writing the peak rate of those infected the numbers hospitalised and sadly the casefatalities in the uk has yet to be reached with measures still in place to suppress virus transmission and lessen pressures on the nhs inevitably questions concerning easing of current restrictions raise issues as to whether there is sufficient acquired immunity in the population  present indication is that still is a low proportion  or whether that can only be achieved once an effective vaccination programme has been developed it is possible that countries where a speedier response was initiated at the outset of the epidemic have been in a better position to see restrictions lifted having gained previous experience with the former sarscov and merscov coronavirus pandemics singapore has been cited as an exemplary model of management being wellprepared in terms of preplanning and rapid implementation of control measures quarantining of infected individuals and family along with early school closure and workplace distancing
25
 based on personal observation as a visitor at the time everyone on airport arrival and at entry to public buildings was subject to infrared thermal scanning and if febrile individuals were immediately isolated with rigorous contact tracing seemingly an effective measure  was this a missed opportunity in the uk furthermore the addition of extensive antigen testing for infected persons and in particular of asymptomatic contacts appeared crucial to early success in controlling the outbreak thereby facilitating an earlier return to postepidemic normality albeit with a small secondary wave relapse attributed to returning nationals since similarly reported in chinaat present uncertainty prevails particularly for those in recognised vulnerable groups such as diabetes without a reliable antibody test many if not most people will be unsure as to their immune status and indeed for those who have recovered from overt coronavirus infection the degree and duration of immunity to further infection are uncertain as yet no specific data in respect of diabetes are available will the immune response to infection be different with diabetes so many questions are at present waiting to be addressed with diabetes itself being a potential composite comorbidity to what extent is outcome determined by additional renal and cardiovascular considerations how have differing levels of glycaemic control and medication influenced outcome were drugs such as metformin and sglt2 inhibitors discontinued on hospitalisation as advised and if so with what consequence what proportion of patients needed immediate conversion to insulin did statins improve the antiinflammatory response or like nonsteroidals possibly the reverse did ace2 inhibitors adversely affect outcome or not the answers will be awaited with considerable interestmeanwhile as the pandemic takes its course the focus moves towards an exit strategy from current restrictions so far untested and almost impossible to configure without risking infection for those as yet unaffected by illness by having taken extra precaution with those most vulnerable including diabetes these individuals remain at risk requiring a level of continued care probably until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available suggestions have been mooted of a differential phased release but there is no easy answer and much will be learnt from the experience this pandemic will eventually settle but it is unlikely to be the last knowledge gained should be used to prepare well in advance for such future contingency and as ever the extra burden of diabetes in the event of overwhelming contagious disease must be constantly addressedcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infectious and communicable respiratory disease caused by the recently surfaced betacoronavirus severe respiratory coronavirus syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 the covid-19 pandemic exerts a major and universal impact on the human population although the case fatality rates of previous coronaviruses middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov 35 and 11 were considerably higher than with sars-cov2 around 2 sars-cov2 has been transmitted much more rapidly and could not be confined to certain regions resulting in a quickly evolving pandemic 1 as of 6 april 2020 1309439 people worldwide have been tested positive for sars-cov2 and 72638 died from covid-19 2 on the same day 12206 persons were tested positive and 220 fatalities were noted in austria 3 moreover 1074 covid patients were hospitalized 250 in intensive care units 4 with most being invasively ventilatedboth sars and sars-cov2 enter the body through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 while mers uses dipeptidyl peptidase-iv dpp4 as its receptor 5 6 both enzyme expression patterns change in diabetes albeit in different ways making the receptor proteins themselves an unlikely explanation for the elevated risk 7 8 instead research focus is shifting more towards impairment of immune response in diabetes as a cause for risk elevation 9 10the first few published case series have described diabetes among other commonly related diseases such as arterial hypertension obesity and coronary heart disease to be a risk factor either for covid-19 itself or a more severe clinical course and mortality 1113 the reason for this remains unclear but the risk population pattern is strikingly similar to the previous fatal coronavirus outbreaks of zoonotic origin sars and mers 14 15several investigations have demonstrated a higher susceptibility to some infectious diseases in diabetes patients particularly of bacterial origin probably owing to a dysregulated immune response 16 diabetes patients comprise a significant proportion of hospitalized covid-19 patients across chinese provinces a diabetes prevalence of 74 but even up to 20 was reported in covid-19 patients 1722 in italy the prevalence of diabetes in hospitalized covid-19 patients was 89 moderately exceeding the local overall diabetes prevalence 62 and roughly reflecting that in people aged 5575 years 23 thus it appears that diabetes patients exhibit only a slightly elevated susceptibility for sars-cov2 infectiona different picture however is seen when diabetes is related to disease severity a report from china showed that patients with diabetes had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease 324 vs 146 and less fever 595 vs 832 compared with patients without diabetes 16 notably diabetes patients presented with higher inflammatory serum markers including lactate dehydrogenase ldh c-reactive protein crp ferritin ddimer lower lymphocyte counts and more pronounced computer tomography ct imaging pathologies indicating more severe overall and particularly lung involvement 16 the ddimer levels which are strongly linked to a higher mortality in covid-19 24 are significantly higher in patients with diabetes indicating a disposition to a hypercoagulable state 16one of the first reports on covid-19 patients revealed that diabetes patients were at higher risk for need of intensive care which usually means invasive ventilation in this report 222 of intensive care unit patients had diabetes compared to 101 in the overall hospitalized covid-19 population hence diabetes confers a similar increase as noted for other risk populations such as those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease 20 a comprehensive report on 1099 patients in china showed a prevalence of diabetes of 74 in the overall covid-19 population however 162 in those with severe disease 17 moreover 262 of patients experiencing the primary composite end point ie admission to an intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death had diabetes a roughly 36-fold enrichment in the critically affected patients a recent meta-analysis calculated an odds ratio of 22 for diabetes patients to be admitted to an intensive care unit 13 accordingly diabetes was significantly associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with a hazard ratio of 23 25 in summary the pooled ratio of diabetes among covid-19 patients with a more severe course compared to those with the more favorable course was 226 indicating a significantly elevated risk 23a similar picture evolved when looking at 2003 covid-19 fatalities prevalence of diabetes was about twofold increased in the non-surviving compared to the surviving covid-19 population in china and italy 23 25 these data mirror the higher mortality rates of diabetes patients in sars and mers 26 moreover presence of diabetic complications potentiates diabetes-related mortality 16 of note plasma glucose levels and diabetes were independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in patients with sars 16 but are not yet evaluated in the current covid-19 season in conclusion diabetes not so much increases the risk of sars-cov2 infection but significantly enhances covid-19 severity and mortalitythe role of acute glycemic control after covid-19 manifestation on clinical outcomes has not been studied yet however in influenza in vitro and animal data suggest that among other negative effects hyperglycemia facilitates local viral replication in the lungs and impairs anti-viral immune response 27 28 therefore acute glycemic management could play an important role in limiting viral replication and disease duration in patients with diabetescardiac injury defined as blood levels of cardiac biomarkers high-sensitivity troponin i above the 99th percentile upper reference limit is significantly associated with mortality in covid-19 patients 29 patients with cardiac injury compared to those without had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes 244 vs 120 multivariable adjusted cox proportional hazard regression revealed cardiac injury and ards but not diabetes itself being an independent mortality risk factor these data indicate that the adverse outcome of diabetes patients is due to a higher rate of cardiac and pulmonary complications 29unfortunately available data do not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in covid-19 making it difficult to compare the contribution of pre-existing metabolic syndrome as it occurs in most patients with t2dm against hyperglycemia without other concomitant metabolic disturbances retrospective data about infection rates in diabetes suggest that people with t1dm are at a greater risk for infectious disease in general with death rates being similar to those with t2dm compared to matched control groups people with both diabetes types have significantly increased mortality from infectious diseases30 however data stratified by type of pathogen eg bacterial viral are currently not availablesome viruses might trigger islet autoimmunity and hence diabetes development 31 exploring data on covid-19 patients with diabetes showed that 292 were under insulin therapy on admission and an additional 375 received insulin therapy after admission indicating poor glycemic control during the disease 16 an earlier study of sars found higher fasting blood glucose levels even in absence of severe disease and glucocorticoid therapy 32 moreover a strong immunostaining of sars-cov and even more sars-cov2 receptor ace2 in langerhans islets suggests potential direct damage to insulin-secreting cells by sars corona viruses 33chronic subclinical inflammation in diabetes is part of a disturbed immune response in sars-cov2 infection a cytokine storm occurs in severe disease as indicated eg by elevated interleukin il-6 serum levels 34 which are higher in diabetes patients along with enhanced disease severity indicating a more pronounced cytokine storm 16 however it is unknown whether treatment with il6 blockade has a beneficial effect on the outcome of covid-19 in patients with diabetes 35the covid-19 pandemic is driving significant changes in the healthcare system and disrupting current best practices for diabetic limb preservation leaving large numbers of patients without care 36 the impact of covid-19 on diabetes complications is difficult to quantify since data are lacking from the ongoing season however one analysis from a cardiac catheter laboratory implied that there is a significant delay in time from onset of stemi symptoms to coronary intervention compared to the previous year most notably in time to first medical contact 37another potential complication particularly vulnerable to disruptions in healthcare provision is limb preservation in patients with chronic wounds and peripheral arterial disease as there are very few substitutional options for direct specialist contact some authors make a case for triage systems which enable reduction of in-hospital visits for nonlife-threatening wounds allocating patients with less severe problems to office visits or even telemedical care and remote monitoring 36 while not yet a validated approach this could free up valuable resources in hospitals for those with urgent treatment indicationsdata on acute complications during pandemic-related healthcare crises eg diabetic ketoacidosis hypoglycemia almost do not exist but will hopefully be generated in the aftermath of sars-cov2 as this may allow planning in comparable future events in a case series 103 329 of the patients suffered at least one episode of hypoglycemia 70 mgdl ie 39 mmoll 38 aside from seeking to achieve individual glucose and other metabolic targets there are currently no special recommendations for people with diabetes regarding covid-19 and its complications 39the initial impact of covid-19 on glycemic control seems to be akin to other infectious disease states acute inflammatory response leads to insulin resistance and subsequent hyperglycemia which in turn necessitates intensification of pre-existing diabetes therapy 40 in a retrospective study from wuhan china 56 out of 881 blood glucose measurements in hospitalized patients with covid-19 were abnormal 38 this illustrates the necessity for a proactive approach in diabetes care for these patients despite blood sugar not being the main focus moreover approximately 70 of patients with t2dm either had to start or intensify insulin therapy during the course of hospital admission 16regarding optimal treatment for covid-19 patients with diabetes physicians should refer to the 2019 guidelines from the austrian diabetes society sterreichische diabetes gesellschaft dg insufficient glycemic control has been shown to negatively affect outcomes in several diseases leading to increased length of hospitalization rate of complications and mortality antidiabetic therapy should be initiated or intensified for patients who repeatedly have preprandial blood glucose values of 180 mgdl 10 mmoldl target glucose depends on several patient factors particularly comorbidities but generally lies between 140 and 180 mgdl preprandially for those with severe signs of covid-19 owing to its well-established efficacy and safety profile insulin is the therapy of choice for these patients preferably as multiple daily injections or in intensive care units continuous intravenous infusion by syringe pump for dose suggestions respective passages in the dg guidelines are recommended 41concomitant medication should be reviewed in every hospitalized patient on admission metformin and sodium glucose transporter sglt2-2 inhibitors both extensively used in type 2 diabetes can have grave potentially life-threatening adverse effects in acute sickness which is why they should be temporarily discontinued during covid-19 it might be prudent to withhold ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arb during acute illness due to increased risk of acute kidney injury in selected diabetes patients 42 43 however a general stop of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors in covid-19 based on considerations of their potential to up-regulate the sars-cov2 receptor ace2 is not recommended 44physicians treating patients with diabetes outside of the hospital setting should be aware of the impact social distancing and quarantine measures may have on glycemic control calling on people to stay at home will most likely reduce the amount of physical exercise compared to usual daily routine while there are no reliable empirical data on this topic one can expect that calorie balance will increase during that period in a proportion of subjects both aspects may lead to a deterioration in glycemic control all patients particularly those with type 1 diabetes should be advised to increase the frequency of blood glucose measurements those with covid-19 should furthermore be re-educated in recognition and handling of diabetic ketoacidosis since infection is one of its most frequent triggers 45the covid-19 has also impacted many treatment facilities for patients with diabetes in order to minimize potential spreading many hospitals have reduced their outpatient clinic capacities to a bare minimum for emergencies additionally many licensed physicians have adopted similar strategies seeking to minimize direct patient visits to their offices depending on the duration of these measures this may leave a huge proportion of diabetes patients in an insecure state with the inability to get a routine check and no option to intensify a potentially insufficient therapy insufficient glucose control has the potential to provoke numerous acute and chronic complications healthcare systems will have to deal with after the covid-19 pandemic telemedicine could be a reasonable approach to at least partly mitigate the problem of uncontrolled diabetes the more widespread use of flash glucose monitoring fgm and continuous glucose monitoring cgm enables the physician to get insights into complete daily glucose profiles with minimum time investment from the patient this approach is especially suitable for experienced type 1 diabetes patients since their insulin dose might be easily adjustable without the need for face to face contact in type 2 diabetes however this option is of limited use as fgm and cgm are not commonly used in this population yet however meta-analyses have found that benefits of telemedicine in type 1 and type 2 diabetes are modest and do not affect clinically relevant end points 4648 however telemedicine with improved instruments could complement personal contact in standard diabetes management notably access to insulin oral antidiabetics and glucose management supplies has not been compromised by the sars-cov2 pandemic as of yet in this region 39diabetes patients are prone to a severe clinical course of covid-19 and significantly increased mortality hence diabetes patients and particularly those with comorbidities must be urged to comply with social isolation and other preventive measures for covid-19 infection moreover patients must be made aware of hyperglycemia by stress and infection and be counselled on how to adapt glucose lowering therapy telemedicine methodologies including interdisciplinary counselling with diabetologists nutritionists and wound managers must be established including compensation models in addition data privacy issues occurring with telemedicine must be solved in cooperation with healthcare providers to promote the security of diabetes patients during the pandemic while maintaining optimal glucose control moreover such strategies developed through the restrictions caused by the pandemic crisis have the potential to become novel standards of diabetes treatment in the future treatment of diabetic complications particularly foot care has to be delivered under safety conditions in order to prevent later amputations moreover the covid-19 pandemic should be used to systematically collect data on patients with diabetes in order to learn for future epidemics overall the covid-19 pandemic crisis should be used to establish innovative management strategies for patients with diabetescoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a new disease which within four months of its origin in wuhan china has now spread to more than two hundred countries around the world affecting more than 2818000 people and has caused more than 196000 deaths as of april 25 2020 1 on march 11 2020 the world health organization who had declared covid-19 a pandemic because of alarming levels of its spread severity and inaction 2 covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is sufficiently genetically divergent from the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus 3 it mainly affects the respiratory tract and the illness ranges in severity from asymptomatic or mild to severe or critical disease although the current estimate of the case fatality rate of covid-19 is  5 up to 1518 of patients may become severe or critically ill some of them requiring icu care and mechanical ventilation 4since covid-19 is a new disease knowledge about this disease is still incomplete and evolving many case-control studies have shown that patients of covid-19 who have underlying diabetes mellitus develop a severe clinical course and also have increased mortality however most of these studies have small sample size and the data in them are heterogenous and conflicting in addition the data on prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 is also not clearhence this meta-analysis was conducted with the primary objective of exploring the relationship between underlying diabetes and severity and mortality of covid-19 disease and with the secondary objective of determining the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19three authors ak saa and sk independently searched screened and selected the studies according to the search inclusion and exclusion criteria pubmed database was searched for papers in english language using the following keywords 2019-ncov ncov-2019 novel coronavirus 2019 sars-cov-2 covid-19 coronavirus coronavirus covid-19 and corona virus since the first report of covid-19 disease was published on december 31 2019 8 we limited our search to articles published since january 01 2020 and the last search was performed on april 22 2020 since there is a high likelihood of duplicate publications on covid-19 9 especially same set of patients being reported in english as well as chinese or other languages hence we restricted our search to papers published in english language only for the same reason we restricted our search to pubmed database only and did not search other databases in addition each included study was carefully evaluated for study setting and author list to exclude any duplicate publicationthe inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies were as follows1the studies should be in english language in the pubmed database2the study design should be case-control and should have categorized the patients into two or more groups depending on the severity clinical course

observational retrospective or prospective interventional studies such as controlled or uncontrolled drug trials were excluded4the study should have included at least 100 patients of covid-195the participants should be adult patients with covid-19 studies describing exclusively pediatric population were excluded however studies which had both adult and pediatric patients were included studies describing exclusively pregnant women were also excluded
the following data were extracted from each study date of online publication pmid number study setting total number of patients their demographic data number of patients with composite endpoint and number of patients with diabetes mellitus among patients with or without the composite endpoint for studies with missing data the corresponding authors of those studies were contacted with a request to provide the missing datathe primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of composite endpoint which for the purpose of our study was labelled as severe clinical course and defined as occurrence of one of the two endpoints depending on each studys individual endpoint1for studies comparing survival and mortality  mortality of covid-19 patients was taken as the composite endpoint2for studies not having mortality as the endpoint one of the following were chosen as the composite endpoint of severe disease depending on studys individual endpointapatients requiring invasive ventilation orbpatients requiring icu care orcpatients having progressive disease ordpatients having refractory disease orepatients categorized as severecritical according to one of the standard predefined criteriaiwho criteria 10 oriinational health commission of the peoples republic of china version 35 criteria 1112 oriiiamerican thoracic society guidelines 13


patients not having any of the above features of severe clinical course were categorized into good clinical coursethe secondary outcome of interest was to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19for the assessment of quality of studies including the risk of bias the national institute of health nih tool for case-control studies was used this tool has been developed jointly by the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the research triangle institute international 14 it uses a composite score of twelve domains with each domain scored as 1 or 0 depending on the response yes or no respectively the studies were categorized as good quality if they scored 8 points fair quality if they scored 67 points and poor quality if they scored 6 pointsthe categorical data was displayed as n and  and continuous data as mean and sd if the study had reported the data as median with iqr or range the method described by wan et al was used to calculate the mean and sd 15to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19 pooled proportion and 95 confidence interval ci was taken as the effect size first the raw proportion from each study was extracted and transformed with the freeman-tukey double arcine method to stabilize the variance 16 then the pooled proportion was obtained using the dersimonian-laird random effects model 17to study the association of diabetes mellitus with the composite endpoint severe clinical course pooled odds ratio with 95 ci was taken as the effect size we performed the meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance approach and dersimonian-laird random effects model 17 a p value of 005 was used to show statistically significant association the meta-analysis was sub-grouped according to the composite endpoint of severe disease and mortalityto assess the heterogeneity among studies i2 statistic was calculated an i2 value  50 indicated substantial heterogeneity to take care of heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate a more conservative result the odds ratios were pooled using only the random effects model to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analysis was done using age type of composite endpoint severity versus mortality country of study china versus others number of patients quality score and quality type good versus fair as co-variates in addition if the heterogeneity among the studies was 50 a sensitivity analysis was also performed after identifying and removing the outlier studieswe evaluated the publication bias through visual inspection of funnel plot and begg 18 and egger 19 tests when the funnel plot was symmetrical and the p value of begg and egger tests were 005 no significant publication bias was considered to exist in the meta-analysis however if publication bias was found a trim and fill analysis of duval and tweedie 20 was used to evaluate the number of missing studies and recalculation of the pooled odds ratio was done after addition of those missing hypothetical studiesreview manager software version 535 the nordic cochrane centre copenhagen denmark openmetaanalyst software version 1012 21 jasp software version 0121 university of amsterdam the netherlands and microsoft excel version 1635 were employed for the meta-analysis and statistical analysesusing the keywords 2019-ncov ncov-2019 novel coronavirus 2019 sars-cov-2 covid-19 coronavirus coronavirus covid-19 and corona virus and limiting the entrez date from 01-jan-2020 through 22-apr-2020 initially 5834 publications in english language were retrieved from the pubmed database which were screened for relevance fig 1
 after carefully going through the abstracts and full texts if needed of these publications only 207 potentially relevant studies were selected and evaluated in detail for potential inclusion of these 174 studies were excluded because of the following reasons 1 144 studies did not have comparative data on covid-19 patients with and without composite endpoint 2 22 studies were small with less than 100 participants 3 7 studies did not have diabetes as one of the comparative factors and 4 1 study was a duplicate publication hence remaining 33 studies were included in the qualitative as well as quantitative synthesis meta-analysis fig 1the study characteristics of the 33 included studies are given in table 1
 the online publication date of the studies in the pubmed database was from february 7 2020 through april 17 2020 twenty out of 33 61 studies were from single centres while remaining 13 39 were multi-centre studies most studies 3033 91 were from mainland china and of the remaining 3 studies two 6 were from usa and one 3 from france the total included patients were 16003 and of them 8849 55 were reported from mainland china 7030 44 from usa and 124 1 from france the median number of patients included in the studies was 214 iqr 139368the quality of study was assessed using the nih tool for case-control studies 14 and the results are shown in table 1 the scores were as follows 912 score 27 studies 82 812 score 5 studies 15 and 712 score 1 study 3 out of the twelve domains assessed by this tool the three domains in which all the studies were given 0 score were sample size justification blinding of assessors and adjusting for confounding variables thus 32 studies 97 were judged as good quality scores of 8 and remaining 1 study 3 was judged as fair quality scores 67 none of the included study was judged poor the single study with fair quality was the paper published by the cdc usa on the covid-19 cases reported to it from all over the us 22 thus it was a registry data rather than a hospital-based study
table 2

has two limitations we have shown that diabetes is associated with covid-19 severity and mortality however it cannot be said whether diabetes is acting as an independent factor responsible for this severity and mortality or it is just a confounding factor many conditions such as elderly age hypertension cardiovascular disease and obesity often co-exist with diabetes and each of these comorbidities have been shown to be associated with severe covid-19 and its mortality in spite of this limitation the implication our meta-analysis will remain unchanged that diabetic need to be protected from covid-19 and they will need extra care if infected the second limitation of this meta-analysis is that we have not been able to document the role of glycemic control on the severity or mortality of covid-19 it has been shown previously that poor glycemic control in terms of high hba1c was significantly associated with increased risk of various infections 5354 however none of the included studies on covid-19 in our meta-analysis had evaluated glycemic control as one of the factors associated with severity andor mortality and this needs to be explored in further trialsin conclusion we have shown in this meta-analysis that presence of underlying diabetes in patients with covid-19 is associated with two-fold increased risk of mortality as well as two-fold increased risk of severity of covid-19 this necessitates enhanced prevention of covid-19 in diabetics increased vigilance in patients of diabetes for covid-19 and a lower threshold for monitoring hospitalization and icu care if diabetics develop this infection results of our meta-analysis emphasizes the need for further investigation on the pathogenic mechanism of relationship between diabetes and covid-19 and to

they have no conflicts of interestsince the first reported case on december 9 2019 in wuhan china cases of the coronavirus 2019 disease covid-19 quickly escalated to global pandemic levels within a month at present 5 months later the number of confirmed cases surpasses 35 million reported across 200 countries and regions all over the world 1 2 the virus responsible for covid-19 now named sars-cov-2 had not previously been described in humans or animals and was reported in january 2020 after isolation from bronchoalveolar fluid of patients 3 4 it is a new beta-coronavirus that shares a high percentage of genomic similarities with sars-cov the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2003 4 among the respiratory syndromes caused by beta-coronaviruses in humans sars-cov-2 infection has a higher basic reproduction number compared to sars- cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov representing a greater threat for international public health 5 preliminary estimates of mortality rates indicate that sars-cov-2 infection is less often fatal than mers- and sars-cov respiratory infections 34 against 344 and 15 respectively 2 6 7 however as evidenced by its higher reproduction rate the covid-19 outbreak already has caused a higher total number of deaths than the other coronavirus respiratory syndromes while cases of covid-19 were estimated at around 35 million around the world as of may 4th 2020 with over 250000 deaths the 2003 sars outbreak had only 8000 cases across 29 countries with 774 total deaths while the 2012 mers outbreak had 2494 confirmed cases reported by 27 countries with a total of 858 deaths 2 6 7 as an ongoing challenge and with the number of confirmed cases increasing exponentially epidemiological data characterizing covid-19 patients are valuable in helping to control the spread and treatment of the disease while its considered a respiratory virus it is now evident that is invades many organs beside the upper and lower respiratory tract and can cause multisystem-wide disease with characteristics unique to each organ it invadesto date studies describing comorbidities related to covid-19 report correlations with distinctive underlying diseases in one of the first reports describing the clinical features of hospitalized covid-19 patients published in february 2020 huang et al found that 32 13 patients had other health issues most common being diabetes cardiovascular disease hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 8 the high incidence of diabetes throughout the world makes this truly worrisome as the pandemic has spread subsequent studies and broader data collection confirmed such observations in a study including 1099 patients 157 of whom were manifesting severe symptoms the most common co-morbidities were hypertension 237 diabetes 162 heart disease 58 and cerebrovascular disease 23 9 hypertension and diabetes were also the most common co-morbidities in a third study that included 140 patients with a prevalence of 30 and 12 respectively where they also correlated with the severity and clinical outcome of the disease 10 in a study of 138 patients wang et al found that 464 64 patients had other underlying conditions and notably that number is much higher 722 amongst patients in the intensive care unit 11 in addition among cases with a negative outcome yang et al described that of a group of 32 non-survivors 7 22 had cerebrovascular diseases and 7 had diabetes 12 in a systematic review including eight different studies encompassing a total of 46248 confirmed cases yang et al found that the most common co-morbidities among covid-19 patients were hypertension 17 and diabetes 8 patients with other underlying respiratory diseases amounted to only 2 13 a summary report from the chinese center for disease control of 72314 cases the largest case load to date informs us that the overall fatality from sars-cov-2 is 23 but that percentage is 73 in those with diabetes 14 so in sum while evidence that diabetes per se makes it more likely that one gets infected with sars-cov-2 is inconclusive or lacking altogether because we lack information on the group of people who get infected but have no symptoms the diabetic condition makes it more likely that infection will be more severe and therefore will result in more hospitalizations that hospitalized diabetic patients will need more intensive care that diabetes patients will spend a longer time in hospital until they are discharged and that patients with diabetes are more likely to die than are non-diabetic patientsit is known that diabetic patients especially with uncontrolled glycemia are at higher risk to contract infections a trend that correlates tightly with glycated hemoglobin levels in clinical practice higher incidence of foot infections yeast infections urinary tract infections and surgical site infections is commonly seen in diabetic patients 1518 there are several host factors that can explain this observation ranging from local changes in bacterial colonization to systemic alterations in immune response for instance cytokine release by macrophages and t-cells is disturbed in diabetes which also impairs neutrophil recruitment 19 alteration of innate immune responses and humoral innate immunity were observed both in vitro and in diabetic patients 2022 in non-obese diabetic mice basal levels of interferon- ifn- a type i interferon are reduced when compared to pre-diabetic mice and ifn- production by cd8 t cells is impaired 21 similarly in persons with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes t1dm and t2dm respectively ifn- production by dendritic cells is reduced 22 impaired dendritic cell functions together with reduced activation of natural killer cells compromise proper adaptative immune responses fig 1
in the adipose tissue of t2dm mouse models and human patients regulatory or anti-inflammatory macrophages m2 and regulatory t cells treg change their profile to pro-inflammatory macrophages m1 and th1 and th17 cd4 t cells 23 as such delayed activation of th1 response and a late hyper-inflammatory reaction are regular findings in diabetes 24 these alternations in immune profile likely contribute to the reasons why patients with dm have higher incidence and severity of infectionstype i ifn plays a crucial role in cd4 t cells differentiation and antiviral response 25 dendritic cells are a necessary element to induce type i ifn-dependent polarization of cd4 t cells into follicular helper t cells tfh vital for immune humoral responses against viral infections 26 interestingly cd4 t cell polarization into tfh happens with ifn exposure at early stages of the infection while exposure at delayed stages promotes differentiation into th1 cells 26 as mentioned above reduced levels of ifn- production by dendritic cells is a feature found in both t1dm and t2dm patients which may favor th1 differentiation to the detriment of tfhwhile the sars-cov responsible for the 2003 outbreak is able to suppress the induction of type i ifn in dendritic cells by inhibiting the transcription factor irf-3 interferon regulatory transcription factor-3 27 this does not seem to be the case for sars-cov-2 28 in fact lokugamage and colleagues show that sars-cov-2 is much more sensitive to type i ifn priming than sars-cov as measured by reduced viral protein and replication in vero e6 cells 28 as such the reduced basal levels of type i ifn observed in diabetic patients offer an additional explanation for the increased risk and severity of covid-19 human ifn2b by vapor inhalation is a adjuvant treatment recommended in guidelines for treatment of coronaviruses in china 29 at least two on-going clinical trials nct04276688 and chictr2000029387 are now evaluating two different type i ifns ifn1b and ifn2b respectively in combination of other antiviral drugs for the treatment of covid-19 in an investigator-initiated open-label study human recombinant ifn nasal drops seemed to effectively prevent infection in medical personnel who were likely to be exposed to sars-cov-2 indicating that ifn inhalation has promise for protecting susceptible healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic and underlining the importance of ifn in this disease 30 if this report is replicated it would be a hugely significant advance in fighting this diseaseaccording to the 2020 national diabetes statistics report elaborated and published by the cdc 13 of all us adults age 18 and up have diabetes corresponding to 104 of total population additionally the prevalence of diabetes increases with age while 43 of adults between 18 and 44 years of age have diabetes this number increases to 175 in the age range of 4564 years and to 268 in people 65 and above 31 even though elderly individuals with dm get infections that are similar to common infections found in younger dm patients age-related immune senescence is an additional component to the already compromised cell-mediated immunity seen in diabetic personsseveral different aspects of the immune response are altered during aging of those changes in t-cell mediated response are the most studied and best described due to gradual thymic involution with aging production of naive t cells is decreased resulting in a limited diversity of t-cell receptors apt to recognize new antigens as such even though the total number of t cells is mostly unaltered with age there is a higher prevalence of memory t lymphocytes in older individuals to the detriment of naive cells 32 this characteristic is one of the reasons why elderly persons have an adequate immune response to previously exposed antigens but poorer response when exposed to new onesdecreased number of naive t cells however is only one aspect of the t-cell system that is altered with aging expression of il2 and its receptor il2r and signal transduction are decreased with aging 33 and a number of other steps in t-cell maturation and activation are also affected one factor that is particularly interesting in the context of diabetes is the association of type i ifns and t-cell differentiation and survivalas previously mentioned type i ifns produced by dendritic cells are a crucial element in cd4 t cells differentiation and antiviral response when dendritic cells present antigen molecules to antigen-specific t cells there is clonal expansion of these lymphocytes and subsequent differentiation into effector cells some of which will later establish t-cell memory in elderly individuals this process is compromisedli and colleagues 34 found that even though the expression of ifn receptor and elements of its intracellular signaling jak-stat pathway did not change with age type i ifn response was still diminished in activated naive cd4 t cells from older individuals rather than decreased expression of components of the ifn response they found an upregulation of inhibitory elements thus cd4 t cells of elderly persons can be considered resistant to tnf contributing to impaired cell-mediate immune response this may represent an additional burden in elderly individuals with dm since as described above ifn- production by dendritic cells is reduced in t2dm which may have therapeutic implicationsaside from bacterial and yeast infections a correlation between diabetes and the prevalence and severity of viral respiratory infections are also well described people with either t1dm or t2dm are reported to have a higher risk of serious complications from the common flu 35 caused by different influenza viruses members of the myxovirus family according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc around 30 of patients hospitalized due to common flu-related complications had diabetes the 2009 swine flu pandemic caused by an outbreak of influenza a virus subtype h1n1 ah1n1 showed similar numbers a canadian study with 239 hospitalized patients with pcr-confirmed influenza ah1n1 found that diabetes triples the risk of hospitalization and once hospitalized diabetic patients had quadruple the risk of being admitted to intensive care 36diabetes and plasma glucose levels were also correlated with severity and mortality in sars patients 37 in a retrospective analysis yang et al compared data from over 400 patients and found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in sars-positive patients than in patients with no-sars pneumonia interestingly in patients who had died from sars infection plasma glucose levels were even higher similarly 215 of the patients who had a negative outcome from sars infection had a history of diabetes a percentage significantly higher than those who recovered from the infection 39of particular interest right now kulcsar and colleagues studied the severity of mers-cov infection in a mouse model of diabetes induced by a high-fat diet 38 their results show a more severe and prolonged acute phase of infection in diabetic mice with impaired cd4 t cell recruitment to the lungs and altered cytokine profiles such as elevated il17 a similar inflammatory response is observed in covid-19 patients as well where low cd4 t cell counts are seen together with a disproportionally high number of th17 cells as mentioned previously one characteristic of the cell-mediate response during aging is decreased il2 production and signaling this also favors cd4 t cell differentiation into th17 cells 39 in addition this inflammatory profile is accentuated in diabetes and may go a long way towards explaining the severity of covid-19 in diabetic patients 40an often-neglected characteristic of diabetes is its effects on the lungs one common finding in diabetic patients is abnormalities in small vessels with thickening of capillary basement membrane that affects many organs and tissues this condition known as diabetic microangiopathy or microvascular disease is an important factor to determine the prognosis of diabetic patients and it frequently affects kidneys eyes skin and muscle another important target however and particularly relevant to this discussion is the lungs alveolar diabetic microangiopathy usually presents itself as subclinical pulmonary dysfunction under normal conditions fig 1 since alveolar microvasculature is structured with large physiological reserve however even in otherwise healthy diabetic patients restriction of lung volume and diffusing capacity can be found in both t1dm and t2dm 41 in a cross-sectional study of 69 patients peak oxygen uptake pulmonary blood flow diffusing capacity and capillary blood volume were all found to be significantly reduced in nonsmoking t2dm patients during exercise this functional impairment correlated directly with glycemic control as measured by hba1c levels extrapulmonary microangiopathy retinopathy neuropathy and microalbuminuria and was aggravated by obesity 41in a study with obese diabetic animals foster and colleagues found extensive fat deposits in the lungs septal lipofibroblasts interstitial matrix and the alveolar macrophages which correlated with alterations in the interstitial environment that presented as increased number of interstitial cells matrix and collagen and reduced capillary volume with thickening of capillary basement membrane 42 intracellular lipid droplets in macrophages is a hallmark feature of classical m1 activation which is caused by a profound cellular metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial respiration 43 diabetes in this case stimulates macrophage activation in response to sterile inflammation which may have profound consequences in the proper inflammatory response to infections as discussed aboveanother point of concern in diabetic patients regarding their pulmonary function is broncho-motor tone and control of ventilation since autonomic neuropathy is a common finding that can be present in up to 30 of patients 44 impaired noradrenergic innervation in bronchioles occurs in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy despite apparent normality in respiratory functions 45 loss of autonomic innervation however may alter respiratory response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli as such it is very plausible that this damage has a negative impact on both the course and prognosis of respiratory infectionseven though a disturbance in immune response may explain the higher risk of infection and worse outcome of diabetic patients with influenza the relationship between diabetes and respiratory infections caused by the coronaviruses mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 may be more complicated the first step in the process of viral infection is the attachment of the virus to its targeted cells there are seven known human coronaviruses all capable of infecting cells in the respiratory system hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e were first described in the 1960s and are thought to cause the common cold 46 sars-cov identified in 2003 47 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 in 2004 associated with weak respiratory infections 48 mers-cov described in 2012 49 and now sars-cov-2 responsible for the ongoing covid-19 pandemicin these coronaviruses the cellular attachment and targeting is mediated by a glycoprotein called spike glycoprotein found in the enveloped surface of the virus the interaction of this glycoprotein with specific molecular targets found in host cells allows for viral adhesion and ultimately cellular infection some of these targets were identified for human coronaviruses and interestingly all of them are membrane-bound exopeptidases the aminopeptidase n apn a metalloprotease mediates the attachment of hcov-229e to host cells 50 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 responsible for the hydrolysis of angiotensin ii into angiotensin 17 is the co-receptor for sars-cov and hcov-nl63 51 52 finally dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp-4 a transmembrane glycoprotein allows the attachment of mers-cov to human host cells but not sars-cov-2 53 54different studies now suggest that besides sars-cov and hcov-nl63 ace2 is also the host co-receptor for sars-cov-2 fig 1 in in vitro studies using hela cells with and without human ace2 expression zhou et al showed that the novel 2019 coronavirus can only infect those cells that express ace2 55 furthermore wrapp et al reported the binding kinetics of sars-cov-2 to human ace2 showing a strong and specific binding with an affinity 20x higher when compared to sars-cov 56 as such the association between ace2 expression and sars-cov-2 infection vulnerability seems clearin two different mouse models of diabetes ace2 expression levels are increased in different organs including the lungs 57 58 recently a similar finding was described in humans a well 54 in a phenome-wide mendelian randomization study investigating factors that causally correlate with pulmonary ace2 expression rao et al found that increased ace2 expression had the most consistent causal link with t2dm traits significant correlations were also found for t1dm as well as inflammatory bowel disease er breast and lung cancer and asthma 54 supporting this finding in a study with 106 covid-19 patients chen et al reported that diabetes negatively affects viral clearance as measured by sars-cov-2 qrt-pcr 59angiotensin is a prohormone that is activated into angiotensin ii by the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace angiotensin ii acts as an agonist for its receptor the angiotensin receptor type 1 at1 ace2 on the other hand promotes the conversion of angiotensin ii into angiotensin 17 fig 1 which no longer is capable of activating at1 but instead binds to and activates the angiotensin receptor type 2 at2 while at1 activation is responsible for the major cardiovascular effects attributed to angiotensin ii inducing vasoconstriction aldosterone synthesis and secretion and renal tubular sodium reuptake at2 activity promotes vasodilation and natriuresis 60 by controlling the ratio between angiotensin ii and angiotensin 17 ace2 is responsible for balancing the opposing roles of at1 and at2in a mouse model sars-cov infection reduced pulmonary ace2 expression 61 the same disturbance was observed in animals that were injected with the viral spike protein alone indicating that the binding of ace2 with the spike protein is enough for its downregulation interestingly in this model acute lung failure could be mitigated by renin-angiotensin antagonists 61olfactory and gustation impairment can affect around 20 of diabetic patients 62 63 based on patient histories altered taste and smell sensing are also a clinical feature in covid-19 in some cases altered chemosensation may be the only symptom as such it appears certain that the chemoreceptor cells for taste and smell are somehow affected by sars-cov-2 infection the chemoreceptor cells for smell which are modified neuronal cells are located in the distal superior portion of the nasal cavity encompassing the superior nasal conche and nasal septum and the distal nasal ends of the cells project cilia into the nasal cavity to sense and discriminate between airborne chemicals however different single-cell rna-seq studies indicate ace2 expression in nasal epithelium is found exclusively in non-neuronal cells 64 65 this observation suggests that sars-cov-2-related anosmia may be caused by infection of support and stem cells in the olfactory epitheliumof note taste buds which contain the taste receptor cells trcs are not only embedded within lingual epithelium of fungiform foliate and circumvallate papillae but they are dispersed across soft palate nasopharynx larynx upper bronchi and proximal esophagus 66 in murine tissue ace2 is expressed in fungiform and circumvallate papillae and throughout the tongue epithelium and of immense relevance to sars-cov-2 ace2 is present on the membranes of type i salt-sensing and type ii sweet and bitter sensing trcs 67 it is therefore highly likely that sars-cov-2 also gains entry to the trcs in those sites fig 1 there is as far as we can ascertain from current literature of the topic no evidence of immune cells residing within taste buds under normal conditions 68 69 and therefore the capacity for any direct early action of immune cells in taste buds to clear the virus is low allowing the virus to replicate unimpeded and potentially shed so as to cause infection lower down the in the pharynx direct infection of the trcs within the enclosed space of the taste bud itself would also likely disturb the signaling machinery of the trcs by impacting neurotransmitter signals - diminishing synthesis of neurotransmitters or causing unregulated neurotransmitter release inability to clear neurotransmitters adequately leading to desensitization of receptors and disturbance of sensory afferent neurons and their receptorsbesides serving as viral reservoirs we hypothesize that trcs may be involved in serving as the sentinels for an inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 and we propose that early loss of taste predicts a brisk ifn response to virus clearing of virus from the oral and nasal cavities and a faster patient recovery the innate immune nod-like receptor pyrin 3nlrp inflammasome 70 in trcs is very likely activated in response to sars-cov-2 infection several viral components from the original sars-cov are known to be sensed as danger-associated a3b2 show 132molecular patterns damps by the nlrp3 inflammasome 71 the nlrp activates caspase-1 which converts the pro-cytokines il-1 and il-18 into their active forms once activated the cytokines recruit innate immune cells to the site of infection and cause production of ifn- there is direct evidence that inflammation ifn and taste are linked because of a well-known clinical observation that ifn therapy is reported to cause altered taste and smell 72 in mice two ifn- receptor subunits ifnar1 and ifnar2 their downstream jak kinases jak1 and tyk2 and the transcription factors stat1 stat2 and irf-9 are all expressed in normal trcs and lps-induced systemic inflammation increases cleaved caspase levels and trc death within taste buds 73 furthermore with increased death of trcs there could be increased viral shedding no loss of taste therefore may be associated with a weak immune response to the virus and the use of ifn-based therapies 29 30 as described above may be both preventing virus gaining an ideal replication target and clearing virus fromthere are approximately 30 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the usa and the vast majority of patients who get a covid-19 infection will be managed at home as regards in-patients in one retrospective study of confirmed covid-19 adults for whom 570 deaths or discharges were recorded and for which point-of-care blood glucose test results bgs are transmitted and stored the mortality rate was 288 in 184 diabetes andor uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients as compared with 62 of the remaining 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia 74 so hyperglycemia per se is clearly associated with increased mortality to underline the necessity of good glucose control in a retrospective analysis of more than 7300 hospitalized covid-19 with and without pre-existing t2dm patients well-controlled blood glucose that is maintaining levels within a range of 39 to 100 mmoll was associated with a significant reduction in composite adverse outcomes and death 75attention to nutrition and adequate protein intake is important mineral and vitamin intake need to continue vitamin c in particular may have a role in covid-19 prevention as have been shown for other infections 76 hydration should be maintained and treatment with acetaminophen humidifier use and continuation of cpap in those with sleep apnea should continue it seems reasonable that anti-hyperglycemic agents that are known to result in volume depletion such as sodium glucose transporter-2 sglt2 inhibitors or hypoglycemia such as chlorpropamide should be avoided care should also be taken with use of glucagon-like receptor-1 glp-1r agonists dose reduction or discontinuation altogether may be needed to prevent nausea abdominal distress and dehydration in patients eating and drinking very little or in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms directly caused by invasion by the virus of the gut dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 inhibitors see discussion below are weak anti-hyperglycemic agents are not first line glucose lowering drugs and probably should be stopped in anyone with any indications of volume depletion or reduced kidney functionnon-hospitalized patients with t1dm as well as t2dm patients using insulin should measure blood glucose and urinary ketones frequently especially if fever and increasing hyperglycemia occur - as is true during all infections frequent changes in dosage and correctional boluses are par for the course in order to maintain normal glucose levels hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 symptoms and concomitant diabetes need escalating frequency of blood glucose monitoring if infection signs worsen subcutaneous insulin via a basal-bolus regimen where possible in hospitalized patients with continuous insulin drip if in an icu setting are the preferred methods to control blood glucose levels oral agents especially metformin and sglt2 inhibitors should likely be stopped biguanides of which metformin is the only one in use for patients with t2dm and pre-diabetes are known to increase lactic acid production in the gut which is then normally cleared in liver however as recently described by two independent groups the human gut epithelium which contains transmembranal ace2 is a site of covid-19 infection that supports viral replication and spread 77 78 and therefore the expectation would be that endogenous lactic acid levels are already high in gut as well as other organs due to infection which could make the risk of lactic acidosis more likely in the presence of metformin this might also have implications for lung function acidosis would impede metabolism and cellular function in infected alveolar cells and t lymphocytes at a time of most vulnerability see discussion aboveto reiterate any drug use that might facilitate dehydration would seem unwise increasing thrombosis especially venous thromboses and micro vascular thromboses in many organs including in pulmonary vasculature 79 and a hypercoagulable state with low platelets 80 are now being reported to occur in extremely sick covid-19 patients dehydration would be seriously detrimental under those conditionsa chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq there has been much discussion on the use of cq and hcq as therapy for covid-19 itself and it is worth remembering that hcq is an approved treatment though not first line for diabetes since 2014 in india when used for malaria prophylaxis and for treating autoimmune arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients appeared to have reduced risk of t2dm though in those conditions risk may be reduced for other reasons besides use of the drugs less obesity more attention to nutrition for instance it was found that hcq treatment led to less insulin requirements in t2dm without altering c-peptide levels this would imply that hcq reduces clearance of insulin and not that it increases its secretion 81 clinical case reports of its use in t1dm would seem to bear this out because improved glycemic control in the setting of reduced insulin requirements have also been reported in that condition additionally there are reports that cq improves insulin sensitivity through activation of akt which would result in greater glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis 82 an additional piece of the puzzle relates to adiponectin it was found that use of the hcq and cq leads to increased adiponectin levels in circulation which is well-described to have favorable effects on glucose uptakeutilization because of its insulin-sensitizing effects adiponectin also has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects that one could hypothesize would have added benefits during covid-19 or indeed any viral infection 83as regards its anti-inflammatory properties hcq use leads to a significant decrease in the production of pro- inflammatory markers and cytokines which is why it is a successful disease modifying anti-inflammatory agent in autoimmune diseases based on in vitro studies it changes the ph of acidic intracellular organelles including endosomeslysosomes essential for the membrane fusion and it was believed that both the agents could be effective tools against sars-cov and data again from in vitro work seemed to indicate that hcq might be cytotoxic for sars-cov-2 84 but clinical trials using hcq have now reported either no benefit or increased mortality due to cardiotoxicity with use of hcq with or without azithromycin 85 many studies are still on-going which should give clarity to the use of these agents in sars-cov-2 decreasing certain cytokines andor lowering intracellular ph in organelles which might result in diminished autophagy might be detrimental when one wants to accelerate clearance of virusb angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers raas inhibitors diabetes hypertension and kidney disease coexist and many such patients are prescribed raas inhibitors because they have well-proven beneficial effects in protecting the kidney and myocardium and in lowering blood pressure and while ace2 expression in lung is increased in diabetes as stated above it is not clear that membrane-bound ace2 which is necessary for sars-cov-2 spike protein attachment is actually increased there are suggestions in the literature that raas inhibitors increase ace2 but again there is a paucity of data to suggest that these have any effect on lung-specific or nasal-specific expression of transmembranal ace2 vaduganathan et al have written a thorough review on the topic of raas inhibitors in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 86 in short however the european society of cardiology council on hypertension the american college of cardiology the american heart association the heart failure society of america and the american society of hypertension have all released similar statements advising against discontinuing such medications as sudden withdrawal in cardio-renal stable patients who are already under severe stress from infection could lead to clinical instability and decompensation for no other reason than a response to mere hypothetical concernsc dpp 4 inhibitors of great interest in virology membrane bound human but not mouse dpp4 is a functional co-receptor for mers-cov 53 though not for sars-cov-2 dpp4 also known as cd26 is a type ii transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many tissues including the immune cells and non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells it also is shed from cell membranes and is therefore present in circulation in the last 3 decades it has been the subject of much research because of its ability to cleave alanine and proline in the penultimate position of peptides chemokines and bioactive compounds resulting in either inactivation or activation of its substrates dpp4 is well known to diabetes researchers and medical practitioners because it inactivates the well-studied gut-derived incretins glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide gip that are released for enteroendocrine cells in response to food in the gut and glp-1r agonists mentioned above are now routine treatments for t2dm management additionally their use can lead to weight loss incretin action through specific receptors on beta cells in islet of langerhans is responsible for about 50 of the secreted insulin after eating 87 88 levels of active full length glp-1 and gip are increased when dpp activity is eliminated and as a consequence dpp inhibitors are now routine though not first line oral agents in managing t2dm by improving insulin secretion dpp4 also plays a role in immune regulation by activating t cells upregulating cd86 expression and the nf-kb pathway chemotaxis modulation cell adhesion and apoptosis 89 its expression is higher in visceral adipose than subcutaneous tissue and directly correlates with adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance despite it activity on cytokines plasma levels of 27 plasma cytokines were unchanged after a four-week treatment with sitagliptin a dpp4 inhibitor 90 and another inhibitor vildagliptin did not affect ex vivo cytokine response or function in lymphocytes taken from t2dm patients 91 review of the literature does not support any meaningful changes in immune function with dpp inhibition in humans and therefore it is not likely to play a role in treating covid-19 additionally despite dpp4 being a co-receptor for mers-cov data are not forthcoming that point to dpp4 inhibitors saxagliptin sitagliptin vildagliptin sterically interfering with or modifying mers-cov binding to subunits of dpp4 53 the use of dpp4 by coronavirus seems to be simply due to coronavirus hitching a ride on an abundant target in epithelial cells unrelated to dpp4s proteolytic activityd hmg-coa reductase inhibitors many t2dm patients are taking statins to control ldl levels and prevent atherosclerotic heart disease in fact the american college of cardiology the american heart association and the american diabetes association all have issued recommendations that anyone aged 40 and older with diabetes be prescribed statins these should be continued during covid-19 infection hmg-coa reductase inhibitors upregulate ace2 as part of their function in reducing endothelial dysfunction and have many other pleiotropic effects independent of their lipid-lowering effects this class of compounds based on observational studies may actually reduce mortality in hospitalized patients with influenza and pneumonias and acute lung injury 92 there is also anecdotal evidence from sierra leone that statins were beneficial during its ebola outbreak and it has been proposed that these agents have a potential role in managing patients with severe covid-19 93e steroids use steroid use will exacerbate hyperglycemia but because very high cytokine and crp levels are routine findings in sars-cov-2 steroids have been used in severely ill patients to suppress the cytokine storm however they have not been shown to decrease mortality and theoretically might even slow viral clearance even in the setting of adult respiratory distress syndrome with sars-cov-2 there is no evidence to suggest they provide any therapeutic benefit the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases has issued guidelines on steroid use in certain circumstances during covid-19 94 use of intranasal steroids such as fluticasone for allergies also should be discontinued until data emerges to say otherwise it is not yet reported if intranasal steroids enhance viral replication in olfactory epithelium or whether people who use them on a consistent basis are more likely to get infected there are theoretical reasons why this may be soindividuals with diabetes are at increased risk for infections and once acquired generally get more severe infections and have much greater increase in mortality compared to non-diabetic patients this is certainly proving the rule with sars-cov-2 it also transpires that 2 coronavirus co-receptors ace2 and dpp4 are well-established actors within metabolic and inflammatory pathways and renal and cardiovascular physiology and have been front and center in diabetes and metabolic research ace2 is a co-receptor for sars-cov-2 while dpp4 is a co-receptor for mers-cov the medical and economic consequences of the sars-cov-2 epidemic require ongoing and real-time adaptation of protocols and standard medical procedures to deliver diabetes care and bring sars-cov-2 under control so as to lower morbidity and mortality for all including people who have diabetes and the elderly while the human population waits with breath that is bated for a vaccinecoronaviruses are enveloped positive single-stranded rna viruses widely distributed in humans and animals worldwide 1 although most human coronavirus infections are mild major outbreaks of two betacoronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002-2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 have caused deadly pneumonia with mortality rates of 10 for sars-cov and 36 for mers-cov 2in december 2019 clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology emerged in wuhan hubei province china deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus as the causative agent which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes called covid-19 1 3 although sars-cov-2 has shown phylogenetic and clinical similarities with sars-cov the novel coronavirus appears to have a higher transmissibility and lower case fatality rates 4 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared the covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and on march 11 the epidemic was upgraded to pandemic 5 as of today 02042020 827419 confirmed cases are officially reported in more than 200 countries or territories with 40777 deaths 6we conducted a scoping review to provide a brief summary of the general characteristics of covid-19 as well as a more detailed description and critical assessment of the association between this new infectious disease and diabetes we hope this review can provide meaningful information for future research and ultimately contribute to better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetesa literature review was carried out to search for articles in pubmed and google scholar databases till 02 april 2020 the following keywords were used sars-cov-2 covid-19 infection pathogenesis incubation period transmission clinical features diagnosis treatment diabetes with interposition of the boolean operator and we also retrieved the full text of the relevant cross references from the search results furthermore we accessed the currently available scientific literature and recommendations in the who and united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc websitesthe incubation period is described as the time from infection to illness onset in a study of 1099 patients from china with laboratory-confirmed symptomatic covid-19 the median incubation period was four days interquartile range 2 to 7 7 another study including 181 confirmed cases reported a median incubation period of approximately 5 days and that symptoms would develop in 975 of infected individuals within 12 days 8 based on the incubation period of sars-cov and mers-cov as well as observational data the united states cdc has estimated that symptoms of covid-19 will usually develop within 2-14 days after exposure therefore fourteen days has been the time applied internationally for monitoring and restricting the movement of healthy individuals quarantine period 9most initial covid-19 patients had a direct contact history with a local chinese seafood and wildlife market suggesting a common-source zoonotic exposure as the main mode of transmission 10 findings from virus genome sequencing analysis have pointed out that sars-cov-2 and bat coronavirus bat cov might share the same ancestor although bats are not for sale in this seafood market 11 later cases were reported among health care workers and others without exposure history of wildlife or visiting wuhan which indicated human-to-human transmission 10 currently it is considered that the virus can be mainly transmitted through droplets direct contact and aerosols droplets transmission may occur when respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes are ingested or inhaled by individuals nearby within about 6 feet a subject can also get infected by touching a surface or object contaminated with the virus and subsequently touching hisher mouth nose or eyes 12 additionally it has been shown experimentally that the virus can remain viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours 13 and can be transmitted in closed environments if inhaled into the lungs 12 therefore airborne transmission is a possibility during aerosol generating procedures eg endotracheal intubation bronchoscopy non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation tracheostomy cardiopulmonary resuscitation etc 14 although viable virus has been identified in fecal swabs the fecal-oral route does not appear to be a driver of covid-19 transmission 11it is uncertain how long an individual with covid-19 remains infectious the period of infectivity is often assessed indirectly by detection of viral rna from respiratory specimens however viral rna does not necessarily confirm the presence of infectious virus higher viral loads have been detected soon after symptom onset suggesting that transmission may be more likely to occur in the earlier stages of infection 15 the viral shedding duration seems to vary according to the disease severity it has been found that around 90 of patients with milder symptoms had a negative viral rna test on nasopharyngeal swabs by day 10 post-onset while the test remained positive for a longer time in all severe cases 16 on the other hand it has been reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that in symptomatic subjects 15 indeed transmission from asymptomatic carriers or individuals within the incubation period has been described 17 nevertheless the extent to which this occurs remains to be determinedeven though all age groups have been affected by covid-19 the median age appears to be around 47-59 years and usually higher among severe cases and non-survivors no specific gender bias seems to exist for the contamination with the virus but men tend to have a higher propensity of the cases 7 18 19 fewer cases have been identified among children and infants in a large chinese report including 72314 patients only 2 of those infected were younger than 20 years old 20the clinical spectrum of covid-19 can be very heterogeneous most adults and children present mild flu-like symptoms but some may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure arrhythmias acute cardiac injury shock multiple organ failure and death 1 18 the most commonly reported symptoms are fever cough fatigue sputum production and shortness of breath however headache upper respiratory symptoms eg sore throat and rhinorrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea and diarrhea occur less often 1 7 18 although not described in the initial chinese studies smell and taste disorders eg anosmia and dysgeusia have also been found frequently in patients with covid-19 in italy 21in laboratory examination results most patients have normal or decreased white blood cell counts particularly lymphocytopenia 7 however in severe patients the neutrophil count inflammatory markers d-dimer blood urea and creatinine levels are generally higher with further decreased lymphocyte counts 1 chest computed tomography ct most commonly shows ground-glass opacifications with or without consolidative abnormalities they are also more likely to be bilateral have a peripheral distribution and involve the lower lobes 7 22 while some confirmed cases may present normal ct images 11 abnormalities have also been identified prior to the development of symptoms in some patients 22individuals with new onset fever andor respiratory tract symptoms eg cough dyspnea or patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause and without any history of close contact with a confirmed covid-19 patient or have travelled to an area of community transmissionsubjects with new onset fever andor respiratory tract symptoms eg cough dyspnea or patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness who have been in contact with covid-19 patients or travelled within 14 days to a location where community transmission of sars-cov-2 is present furthermore patients older than 60 years of age as well as those with underlying conditions like diabetes hypertension cardiovascular diseases cvds chronic renal disease cancer and immunocompromising conditions who develop symptoms of fever cough andor dyspnea should be prioritized for testingpersons in close contact within 2 meters with a sars-cov-2 infected individual for a prolonged period or in direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing personal protective equipmentalthough the pathophysiological mechanisms are still not understood it has been observed that most severe and fatal cases with covid-19 have occurred in the elderly or in patients with underlying comorbidities particularly cvds diabetes mellitus chronic lung and renal disease hypertension and cancer 7 20 26 27one chinese meta-analysis including 1527 patients showed that the most prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities with covid-19 were hypertension 171 95 ci 99 - 244 and cardio-cerebrovascular disease 164 95 ci 66 -261 followed by diabetes 97 95 ci 69 - 125 in this report patients with diabetes or hypertension had a 2-fold increase in risk of severe disease or requiring intensive care unit icu admission while those with cardio-cerebrovascular disease had a 3-fold increase 28 in a sub-set of 355 patients with covid-19 in italy who died the mean number of pre-existing underlying conditions was 27 and only 3 subjects did not have any comorbidity 29it has been consistently reported that in addition to pneumonia sars-cov-2 may cause damage to other organs including the heart liver and kidneys 1 18 therefore full attention should be paid to the treatment of the original comorbidities especially in older patients with already severe underlying conditionsdiabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world the condition is associated with several macrovascular and microvascular complications that ultimately impact the overall patients survival 30 a relationship between diabetes and infection has long been clinically recognized 31 infections particularly influenza and pneumonia are often common and more serious in older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm 32 33 nevertheless the evidence remains controversial regarding whether diabetes itself indeed increases susceptibility and impacts outcomes from infections or the cardiovascular and renal comorbidities that are frequently associated with diabetes are the main factors involved 34diabetes and uncontrolled glycaemia were reported as significant predictors of severity and deaths in patients infected with different viruses including the 2009 pandemic influenza a h1n1 35 sars-cov 36 and mers-cov 37 in the current sars-cov-2 pandemic some studies did not find a clear association between diabetes and severe disease 19 38 however other reports from china 7 20 and italy 29 showed that older patients with chronic diseases including diabetes were at higher risk for severe covid-19 and mortalityscarce data exist regarding glucose metabolism and development of acute complications of diabetes eg ketoacidosis in patients with covid-19 infection of sars-cov-2 in those with diabetes possibly triggers higher stress conditions with greater release of hyperglycemic hormones eg glucocorticoids and catecholamines leading to increased blood glucose levels and abnormal glucose variability 39 on the other hand a retrospective study from wuhan reported that around 10 of the patients with t2dm and covid-19 suffered at least one episode of hypoglycemia 39 mmoll 40 hypoglycemia has been shown to mobilize pro-inflammatory monocytes and increase platelet reactivity contributing to a higher cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes 41 yet it remains largely unknown how exactly the inflammatory and immune response occurs in these patients as well as whether hyper- or hypoglycemia may alter the sars-cov-2 virulence or the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or glycemic control furthermore the impact of usual diabetes drug treatment on covid-19 outcomes as well as therapeutic approaches for covid-19 on glucose regulation remains unspecifieddiabetes is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple metabolic and vascular abnormalities that can affect our response to pathogens 34 hyperglycemia and insulin resistance promote increased synthesis of glycosylation end products ages and pro-inflammatory cytokines oxidative stress in addition to stimulating the production of adhesion molecules that mediate tissue inflammation 34 42 this inflammatory process may compose the underlying mechanism that leads to a higher propensity to infections with worse outcomes thereof in patients with diabetes 34several defects in immunity have been associated with hyperglycemia even though the clinical relevance of some in vitro disturbances are still not fully understood 43 poorly controlled diabetes has been linked to inhibited lymphocyte proliferative response to different kinds of stimuli 44 as well as impaired monocytemacrophage and neutrophil functions 34 abnormal delayed type hypersensitivity reaction 43 and complement activation dysfunction 45 have also been described in patients with diabetes in vitro studies have shown that pulmonary epithelial cells exposure to high glucose concentrations significantly increases influenza virus infection and replication indicating that hyperglycemia may enhance viral replication in vivo
46 in animal models structural lung changes have been related to diabetes such as augmented vasculature permeability and collapsed alveolar epithelium 47 on the other hand patients with diabetes generally present a significant reduction in forced vital capacity fvc and forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 which is associated with raised plasma glucose levels 48patients with covid-19 commonly show on admission lymphocytopenia and to a lesser extent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia which are more prominent among those with severe disease 7 further elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 il-6 and c-reactive protein as well as increased coagulation activity marked by higher d-dimer concentrations were also associated with severity 7 26 in t2dm besides the marked inflammatory process previously discussed an imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis takes place with increased levels of clotting factors and relative inhibition of the fibrinolytic system both insulin resistance and t2dm are associated with endothelial dysfunction and enhanced platelet aggregation and activation these abnormalities favor the development of a hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic state 49 additionally atherosclerosis vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are also part of the pathogenesis of other chronic conditions eg hypertension and cvds 42 animal studies involving sars-cov reported that older age was related to defects in t-cell and b-cell function and excess inflammation markers thus t2dm alone or in association with older age hypertension andor cvds might contribute to a deficient control of sars-cov-2 replication and more prolonged proinflammatory response potentially leading to poor outcomes 26viral entry into the host cells is a fundamental component of cross-species transmission particularly for the coronaviruses covs upon exposure of the host to the virus all covs through a spike protein bind to cells that express specific receptors after binding to the target cells the host-cell protease cleaves the spike which allows the virus to enter and replicate 50 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as one of the main receptors for both sars-cov 51 and sars-cov-2 50 ace2 is widely expressed on the respiratory tract heart kidneys intestines cerebral neurons endothelium of arteries and veins immune cells and pancreas 2 a chinese study compared 39 sars-cov patients without previous diabetes who did not receive steroid treatment with 39 matched healthy siblings and showed that 20 of the 39 sars-cov patients developed diabetes during hospitalization since immunostaining for ace2 was strong in the pancreatic islets it was suggested that sars-cov might have damaged islets and caused acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus 52 therefore although further evidence is needed pancreatic damage may also be present in covid-19 patients possibly contributing to worse outcomes in subjects with diabetesprevious studies have reported decreased mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were in continued use of ace inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs 53 54 these medications are postulated to have significant immunomodulatory effects 55 and reduce pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response by decreasing cytokines 53 54 they are commonly used by those with diabetes and hypertension 56 therefore their impact on the clinical course of covid-19 has been widely debated considering that ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 and its levels can be increased by ace inhibitors and arbs it has been argued that these drugs might affect negatively the outcome of covid-19 patients 57 on the contrary some have advocated that aceis and arbs might rather be beneficial 58 sars-cov infection and the virus spike protein reduce ace2 expression mice injected with sars-cov spike presented worsened acute lung failure which could be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway 59 nevertheless a retrospective analysis performed on 112 patients with covid-19 and cvd did not show a significant difference in the proportion of aceiarb medication between survivors and non-survivors 60 similar to aceis and arbs ibuprofen 61 and thiazolidinediones 62 can also result in increased levels of ace2 thus generating questions regarding the safety of these drugs in patients with covid-19although diabetes has been associated with worse outcomes in covid-19 patients the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection may not be higher in people with diabetes according to several studies the prevalence of diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population even slightly lower 28 63 a meta-analysis of 12 studies describing data from 2108 chinese patients with covid-19 reported a diabetes prevalence of 103 63 which was similar to the national prevalence of 109 reported in 2013 64 an italian study conducted among 146 patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection at the university hospital of padova found an equivalent pattern the prevalence of diabetes in these patients was 89 mean age 653 years while it was 110 among people aged 55-75 years mean age 65 years from the same region in 2018 65 although underreporting may be an issue to consider potential biological mechanisms should not be disregarded it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 is the primary receptor of mers-cov 2 since dpp-4 inhibitors are commonly applied in the treatment of diabetes worldwide future research should explore whether dpp-4 may also act as receptor for sars-cov-2 thus contributing to a potential protective effect of these drugs against covid-19 63 66so far no anti-sars-cov-2 drug or vaccine has been officially approved for covid-19 treatment 67 several clinical trials are in progress to assess the safety and efficacy of potential treatment alternatives including remdesivir tocilizumab lopinavirritonavir ribavirin interferon chloroquine phosphate arbidol among others 68 one promising pharmacological option of relevance for patients with diabetes is chloroquine and its hydroxy-analogue hydroxychloroquine widely used for malaria and autoimmune diseases chloroquine has also been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug although the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for covid-19 treatment remain unclear a recent study showed that the drug was highly effective in controlling sars-cov-2 infection in vitro in addition to its immunomodulant and anti-inflammatory effect chloroquine increases endosomal ph and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov thereby blocking viral infection 69 preliminary results from more than 100 patients included in a chinese clinical trial showed that chloroquine was superior to the control group in shortening the disease course inhibiting pneumonia exacerbation promoting a virus negative conversion and radiological improvement without severe side effects 70 on the other hand several studies have reported that hydroxychloroquine improves glycemic control in decompensated treatment-refractory patients with diabetes 71 72 it has even been approved to treat t2dm in india as an add-on therapy for patients who do not achieve glycemic targets with two other oral glucose-lowering drugs 73 although inflammation is associated with impaired glucose control the underlying mechanism of hydroxychloroquines hypoglycemic effect remains unclear 71 it has been described that chloroquine increases the c peptide response potentially reflecting an improved pancreatic -cell function 72 reduced intracellular insulin degradation and increased insulin accumulation have also been identified as possible effects of hydroxychloroquine in animals models 74 given the previously reported impact of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine on glucose metabolism caution should be taken when the drug is administered to patients with diabetes and covid-19 a dose adjustment of the oral antidiabetic drugs andor insulin might be necessary in order to prevent potential hypoglycemic eventsthe effect of corticosteroids on covid-19 is also under investigation 68 acute lung damage and ards are partly due to the host immune response while corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation they also inhibit immunity and pathogen clearance 75 in sars-cov and mers-cov infections pulmonary histology showed inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage 76 therefore corticosteroids were broadly applied 77 78 however evidence did not show benefits rather it was reported delayed viral rna clearance or increased mortality and rate of complications including diabetes psychosis and avascular necrosis 75 the interim guidance from the who on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when sars-cov-2 infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids outside clinical trials 79 considering the hyperglycemic effect 80 and the impact of these drugs on the immune response 75 special caution should be taken in patients with diabetes included in trials assessing the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids for covid-19 80no data is available regarding the most appropriate management of patients with diabetes infected by sars-cov-2 as well as patients with covid-19 who develop glycemic decompensation rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might attenuate worsening of symptoms and adverse outcomes although hyperglycemia is usually the main concern in this context one should not disregard the possibility of hypoglycemic episodes as a result of the interplay between drug treatment viral pathogenesis and typical metabolic disturbances of diabetes patient tailored therapeutic strategies and optimal glucose control goals should be formulated based on disease severity presence of comorbidities and diabetes-related complications age and other factors a multidisciplinary team approach including infectologists endocrinologists pulmonologists psychologists nutritionists and exercise rehabilitation specialists may be necessary during the prolonged hospitalization periods and recovery special attention should be paid to those with diabetic nephropathy or diabetes-related heart complications since they are also at higher risk for severe covid-19 and death 7 19 finally increased vigilance and testing in outpatient diabetes clinics for covid-19 as well as lower thresholds for hospitalization of these patients may have a positive impact on their outcomescovid-9 has rapidly spread since its initial identification in wuhan and has shown a broad spectrum of severity early isolation early diagnosis and early management might collectively contribute to a better control of the disease and outcomes diabetes and other comorbidities are significant predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with covid-19 future research is urgently needed to provide a better understanding regarding potential differences in genetic predispositions across populations underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the association between covid-19 and diabetes and its clinical management

will not be published elsewhere in the same form in english or in any other language including electronicallyin the last few months rapid publications reporting on the outbreak of the novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 have flooded the scientific literature 1 soon after the number of cases outside china increased 13-fold and the number of countries with cases increased threefold the world health organization who declared the novel coronavirus covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic 3112020 2 the covid-19 virus was first named 2019 novel corona virus 2019-ncov2 immediately after it was identified and isolated subsequently the who officially changed its name to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 this novel coronavirus is structurally related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 4 previous to the current covid-19 pandemic there were reports that hyperglycemia and overt diabetes were considered independent predictors for higher mortality among patients with severe sars vs non-sars pneumonia 5 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc have also highlighted that patients with overt diabetes andor the metabolic syndrome might have up to ten-times greater risk of death when they contract covid-19 5 on average each infected person spreads the infection to additional persons and the virus stays in the oropharynx early in the course of disease leading to a higher infectivity during presymptomatic stages figure 1 sources from the mrc centre for global infectious disease analysis at the imperial college london have stated that minor differences in transmission rates r0 infection basic reproduction number for viruses can lead to drastic differences in the final number of overall infections they have mathematically estimated that the covid-19 virus has an r0 of 1535 meaning that if four individuals were infected with the virus with an r0 of 35 they would infect 14 more who would infect 49 more and so on figure 1 a mean interval of 91125 days between the onset of illness and hospitalization has been documented 6 very early reports from the city of wuhan in hubei province china indicated that the patient mean age was 59 years old 56 of affected were males and as previously observed with influenza a higher mortality was found among patients with preexisting comorbidities and the elderly 7 diabetes stood out among those coexisting conditions 89although diabetes is classified as a non-communicable disease 10 evidence indicates a major role of infectious agents as possible interactive factors associated with diabetic status 11 common infections occur more frequently in diabetic individuals moreover infectious agents have a possible immunologic impact on different classes of diabetes type 1 or 2 accompanied by the diabetic genetic component and combined with immune dysfunction 12 this review centers on the presence of diabetes as a potential risk factor for severity and death for a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 disease and dysglycemia requiring hospitalization oxygen support and admission to an intensive care unit it also includes prediabetic states such as the insulin resistance metabolic syndrome and adipose tissue dysfunction and its probable impact on covid-19like other diseases associated with the coronavirus family such as sars covid-19 is mainly a disease of the respiratory system that could interact with the metabolic and endocrine system 13 enteroviruses 14 hepatitis c virus 15 and prion-like protein aggregates 16 have been suspected to play a role in the pathobiology of diabetes diabetics also present defects in adaptive immunity delayed th-1 type hypersensitive reactions and reduced lymphocyte proliferation 1117 defects of the innate response in diabetes come with dysfunction of granulocytes monocytemacrophages dendritic cells natural killer nk cells b cells t cells and cytokine signaling 1819 having a parent with diabetes increases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus by 3040 20 diabetes-predisposing genes also play important roles in immunity individuals carrying these genes are prone to have defective immune defenses 12 studies in rodents have shown that after mers-cov infection t2d mice presented immunoinflammatory abnormalities and developed an altered profile of cytokines with increased expression of il-17 following infection observing that the presence of both t2d and the viral infection resulted in more deleterious lung damage and a dysregulated immune response 21 allard et al reported the presence of diabetes in 22 patients from 239 with confirmed influenza h1n1 and their odds ratio for icu admission was 429 among hospitalized patients with diabetes compared to those without they concluded that diabetes triples the risk of hospitalization h1n1 infection and quadruples the risk of icu admission once hospitalized 22 a recent study found that among 1122 patients in 88 us hospitals 570 patients who died or were discharged the mortality rate was 288 in 184 diabetes andor uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients compared with 62 of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia among the 184 patients with diabetes andor hyperglycemia who died or were discharged 40 of 96 uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients 417 died compared with 13 of 88 diabetes patients 148 uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as 2 blood glucoses bgs 180 mgdl within any 24-hour period 23 direct damage to -cell islets has been reported when the sars coronavirus binds to pancreatic ace2 receptors reducing insulin secretion and causing -cell dysfunction and hyperglycemia given that t2d increases the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme in lung liver and heart this direct damage to other key organs could explain to a certain extent the findings of multi-organ failure in sars-cov severe infections 24 the report of higher mortality in uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients reported by bode et al 23 and the fact that sars coronavirus binds to pancreatic ace2 receptors decreases insulin secretion and causes b-cell dysfunction 24 lead to a valid speculation that uncontrolled hyperglycemia above 180 mgdl in covid-19 patients could be a marker of a very severe statethe genetic basis of type 1 diabetes t1d is well established with more than 60 identified genes explaining 80 of its heritability predisposing gene variants to t1d such as ins ptpn22 il27 and ifih1 involved in immune function regulation of t-cell activation or innate virus immunity have already been characterized 2526 additionally hyperglycemia is linked with both chronic inflammatory processes and diabetes related vulnerability to infection it affects innate immunity by impeding the production of type i interferon which has multiple effects including antiviral activity peripheral blood mononuclear cells show an impaired production of il1 a key mediator in inflammation in diabetics indicating reduced innate cell activation 12 scd40l is shed by activated t lymphocytes and platelets plasma levels of scd40l are elevated in hyperglycemic t2d patients immune activation is achieved by binding of cd40l to t cells macrophages or b cells hyperactivation of cd40 bolsters the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammatory milieu downregulating antigen-specific responses 27 il15 is a membrane-associated molecule that promotes the activation of nk and cd8 t-effector memory cells expression of il15il15ra occurs in viral infections pathogenic elevated serum levels of il15 have been reported in t1d patients 928 a recent study demonstrated that o-glcnac transferase ogt a key enzyme for protein o-glcnacylation mediated influenza a virus iav-induced cytokine storm the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway hbp-associated o-glcnac enzyme ogt was induced by iav to bind to interferon regulatory factor5 irf5 o-glcnacylation of irf5 is required for ubiquitination of irf5 and subsequent cytokine production they identified a molecular mechanism by which hbp-mediated o-glcnacylation regulates irf5 function during iav infection highlighting the importance of glucose metabolism in iav-induced cytokine hyperinflammatory responses 29 this evidence clearly demonstrates that diabetics have dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses contributing to an increased susceptibility to viral bacterial and fungal infections the abnormal diabetic pathophysiology alters leukocyte normal activities such as chemotaxis phagocytosis and the ability to kill intracellular pathogens 30 several family-based studies of disease heritability have indicated that type 2 diabetes t2d is strongly heritable and highly prevalent in large extended families where one or two members are diagnosed with the disease and this heritability is on average 25 31 according to the international diabetes federation diabetes caused 42 million deaths in 2019 there are 463 million adults with diabetes in the world by 2045 this will rise to 700 million 11 million are children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes reports from the who as of may 15th 2020 indicated that the sars-cov-2 virus has resulted in more than 4700000 confirmed infections and 315000 deaths worldwide in the us reports indicate more than 1450000 confirmed infections and 89000 deaths the cdc suggested that between 160 million and 210 million americans could contract the disease over a 12-month period based on mortality data and current hospital capacity the number of deaths under the cdcs scenarios could range from 200000 to 17 million 32 very early reports from january 2020 regarding the covid-19-diabetes connection should have alarmed the field when out of 41 confirmed covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital in china eight were diabetic 20 13 32 patients were admitted to an icu and six 15 died 33 yang and colleagues reported that diabetes was found in 22 of 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients with novel covid-19 9 zhang and colleagues showed that of 140 patients who were admitted to the hospital with covid-19 12 had diabetes 34 another study reported 162 of diabetes among 173 patients with severe disease out of 1099 patients with confirmed covid-19 35 guo et al reported a mortality rate from covid-19 infected patients among people with diabetes and without other comorbidities of about 16 this paper also highlighted that there could be an initial milder evolution and symptoms of the sars-cov-2 infection in diabetic individuals with a consequent delay in appropriate and aggressive intervention that may lead to catastrophic and life-threatening late outcomes interleukin-6 il-6 fibrinogen and c-reactive protein were reported significantly more elevated in the patients with diabetes and covid-19 infection 8 a recent meta-analysis including 1576 infected patients from seven studies reported a prevalence of diabetes of 97 95 ci 72122 36 the global prevalence of diabetes among adults over 18 years of age rose from 47 in 1980 to 85 in 2014 according to who data 37 reports from the chinese centre for disease control and prevention from 72314 cases of covid-19 showed that patients with diabetes had a threefold higher mortality rate than did those without diabetes 73 vs 23 respectively this is perhaps the largest published study relevant to covid-19 patients and diabetes 38 although we all understand that this is a new lethal disease and the information is urgently needed caution is advisable when interpreting the findings from these studies most of the data presented is mainly cross-sectional not longitudinal comparing follow-up data over time and the number of subjects most of the time is small without a control group although diabetes has been found highly prevalent among severely covid-19 affected patients in most of these studies it is interesting to note that in europe for example nearly all coronavirus deaths are people aged 60 or older and many of these patients are diabeticobese people are up to 80 times more likely to develop t2d 39 researchers from france recently reported that obesity bmi 30 kgm2 and severe obesity bmi 35 kgm2 were present in 476 and 282 from 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care single center for sars-cov-2 they concluded that covid-19 disease severity increases with higher bmi 40 researchers from nyu langone health reported that out of the 3615 individuals who tested positive for covid-19 775 21 had a body mass index bmi 3034 and 595 16 of the total cohort had a bmi 35 there were 1853 51 patients discharged 1331 37 were admitted to the hospital in acute care and 431 12 were either directly admitted or transferred to the icu during admission they concluded that although patients aged 60 years are generally considered a lower risk group of covid-19 disease severity based on their data obesity in this age group appears to be a previously unrecognized risk factor for hospital admission and need for critical care 41 a recent editorial also highlighted that the increased prevalence of obesity in older adults in italy compared with china may have been a key factor regarding the differences in mortality between the two countries 42 the authors mentioned that from the millions of people infected with the 2009 h1n1 influenza virus thousands were hospitalized and unfortunately died obesity and severe obesity were identified as main risk factors for hospitalization and mechanical ventilation 43 they particularly mentioned the case of california where out of 1088 h1n1 influenza virus patients hospitalized in critical condition 268 were older than 20 years old from whom 156 cases 58 had a bmi  30 of these 67 43 had a bmi  40 44 this was also the 2009 h1n1 story for new mexico where 46 had obesity and 56 of those requiring mechanical ventilation had severe obesity 45yang et al also reported in their meta-analysis that compared the non-intensive care unit icu vs icu covid-19 patients icu patients had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tumor necrosis factor tnf 36 as in these covid-19 infections there is evidence supporting the involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of both type 1 t1d and t2d mechanisms thought to be responsible for the inflammatory state in t2d include activation of the nuclear factor-b nf-b and jun n-terminal kinase jnk pathways activation of interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 tnf and recruitment and activation of immune cells 12 diabetes and hypertension share common pathways among them the sympathetic nervous system sns the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas including angiotensin-converting enzyme ace oxidative stress adipokines insulin resistance ir currently considered a prothrombotic state and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ppars 46 the sars-cov-2 envelope spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 to access human cells ace2 degrades angiotensin ii into angiotensin 17 ace2 inhibition allows angiotensin ii to bind angiotensin 1 receptor at1r or at2r to exert proinflammatory responses insulin resistant and t2d patients with severe covid-19 infection may have an increased activation of at1rat2r 47 we have been describing how diabetic patients would be at higher risk for fatality than non-diabetic if covid-19 infection is present however we should also consider that non-diabetic covid-infected individuals could be at a higher risk as well to develop diabetes as a long-term consequence of this infection ace2 the access of sars-cov-2 to enter human cells is fully expressed in hepatocytes and -cells with the expected infection of liver and pancreas during an acute infection 48 therefore a potential impairment of liver glucose utilization and uptake and pancreatic insulin secretion could be a devastating acute andor long consequence of covid-19 infection in some individuals sars-cov-2 could also predispose the immune system of certain individuals to overreact against their -cells and develop autoimmune diabetic disease therefore we must always keep in mind that there could be a dark side of covid-19 towards the insulinglucose axis given its role in acutely infecting the liver and -cells at a molecular leveldiabetes is the hallmark of immunometabolic diseases a cluster of chronic pathologies including insulin resistance hypertension dyslipidemias and cardiovascular disease cvd they are the leading cause of death across the world these pathologies are associated with multiple immune risk factors of metabolic origin that may not be obvious in symptom-free individuals 4950 recent research has increased our awareness of the key role that adipose tissue at dysfunction plays in the development of ir the underlying cause of t2d and other immunometabolic diseases 51 the core mechanisms of at dysfunction involves localized immunometabolic processes during at expansion involving the immune response such as impaired angiogenesis and hypoxia inflammation inappropriate extracellular matrix ecm remodeling and fibrosis that would inexorably become systemic at later stages at dysfunction is characterized by macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue 51 interactions between macrophages and adipocytes represent the early molecular events that will lead to subclinical inflammation ultimately giving rise to ir and its sequelae glucotoxicity lipotoxicity endothelial dysfunction systemic inflammation and cvd 4952 there is a current lack of clinically oriented indicators to assess the complex phenomenon of at dysfunction for early detection of cardiovascular and immunometabolic risk before it develops into an evident systemic muscle and liver ir overt metabolic syndrome and chronic subclinical low-grade systemic inflammation 4953 figure 1an adiponectinleptin ratio alr has been recently developed as a functional marker of adipose tissue at dysfunction 54 individuals with a low alr are characterized by a lower secretion of antiinflammatory adiponectin in relation to proinflammatory leptin levels unhealthy adipose tissue hypoxia proinflammatory macrophage polarization altered adipokine profile and ir these individuals are at higher risk for systemic subclinical inflammation cardiovascular and immunometabolic pathologies 5355 a consequence of chronic positive energy balance leading to at dysfunction is an ectopic deposition of non-esterified fatty acids nefa as triacylglycerol in the liver skeletal muscle and pancreas promoting lipotoxicity a proinflammatory state and ir 56 another new biomarker already validated the adipose tissue-insulin resistance iri index adipo-iri  plasma-free fatty acids  fasting plasma insulin fpi mmollpmoll is calculated based on the linear relationship between the rise in the fpi level and inhibition of the rate of fasting plasma nefa 57 individuals with an elevated adipo-iri have a more pronounced adipose tissue ir leading to a more severe local and systemic proinflammatory state 58 wen et al reported that the degree of adipose tissue insulin resistance increases in obesity and t2d and is associated with prediabetes 59 recent published research from rodriguez et al reported data from systemic measurements of the alr and the adipo-iri index in symptom-free adults to characterize at dysfunction 49 the investigators used age gender weight waist and  body fat matched groups of volunteer study subjects their blood pressure and biochemical phenotypic measurements for fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides were within normal ranges a pattern of metabolically driven inflammation characterized by increased circulating leptin concentrations along with a decreased levels of adiponectin indicative of an impaired adipose tissue adipokinome was found in the symptom-free subgroup with a low l alr proinflammatory fasting systemic biomarker levels between the high h and low l alr and adipo-iri groups showed higher systemic levels of tnf- il-6 hs-c-reactive protein crp and pai-1 in the symptom-free subjects with l alr their data also showed that the mean homeostasis model assessment homa was frankly elevated and the insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 glp-1 postprandial curves and their area under the curve auc were increased in the l alr group compared to the subjects with a h alr particularly the insulin curve showed striking elevation in the individuals with l alr they concluded that in apparently symptom-free individuals a cluster of altered immunometabolic phenotypes related to impaired angiogenesis and hypoxia inflammation inappropriate extracellular matrix ecm remodeling and macrophage polarization could be place into a systemic and molecular construct coined as adipose tissue dysfunction which would trigger the early events leading to the development of insulin resistance and systemic inflammation 49this deleterious scenario could also have somehow served as the underlying mechanism enhancing a covid-19-driven cytokine storm-like hyperinflammatory state in subjects without overt diabetes but with undetected immunometabolic abnormalities and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation which when severely infected with covid-19 trigger multi-organ failure and death 60 therefore a great deal of individuals exposed to covid-19 but with subclinical inflammation adipose tissue dysfunction and prediabetes might also be at a higher risk of developing severe life-threatening respiratory illness after covid-19 infection figure 1 and figure 2 there is accumulating evidence suggesting that a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 might have profound myocarditis fatal arrhythmias 36 and brainstem infection leading to respiratory failure and encephalopathy and a cytokine-like storm syndrome with hyperinflammation liver heart and kidney cytopenias hyperferritinemia severe hypercytokinemia and multiorgan failure figure 2 61 a recent preprint from petrilli et al reported a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection treated at an academic health system in new york city between 1 march 2020 and 2 april 2020 among 4103 covid-19 patients 1999 were hospitalized of whom 292 146 died 445 patients required mechanical ventilation of whom 162 364 died the most relevant hospitalization risk criteria were age 6574 years bmi 40 and heart failure a key question would be how many of these obese individuals were metabolically unhealthy 62 for critical illness the most important parameters were abnormal oxygen saturation d-dimer ferritin procalcitonin and the proinflammatory c-reactive protein crp 200 the two more important features in the decision tree for admission were age 65 and obesity 63 of note this new research document has not been yet certified by peer review therefore it should not be used to guide clinical practicea valid question is why some covid-19 positive-test cases present with only mild symptoms compared to others that have severe symptomatology ending up with fatal outcomes so far all data indicates that people who are older immunocompromised or have significant underlying conditions such as heart failure coronary heart disease arrhythmia diabetic nephropathy and mainly any kind of limited lung function asthma acute or chronic pulmonary disease among others are more likely to develop poorer outcomes and multiorgan failure 61 however it is unclear why covid-19 has caused the death of perhaps thousands of young and not so young people without any apparent underlying health conditions scientists are desperately trying to unravel why covid-19 can be lethal to young and apparently healthy individuals they speculate that genetics play a key role and some young people might have structural variations in the gene that encodes the ace2 receptor influencing its binding with the sars-cov-2 spike protein making them more susceptible to covid-19 infection 64 sars-cov-2 supposedly affects women less than men due to the presence of two x chromosomes in women with immune regulatory genes encoded by x chromosome in female gender causing lower viral load levels 65 indeed current data shows that the overall covid-19 fatality rates are much higher for men some other factors indicate that perhaps men develop a higher susceptibility than women due to unhealthy lifestyle habits such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption as examples contributing to lung and liver disease which are risk factors for severe covid-19 according to the cdc 6667 the severity of some cases in the young may also be related to the viral load at the time of exposure to the virus 6according to the who 34 of men over the age of 15 are cigarette smokers compared to 6 of women 45 of the us population over the age of 50 is obese the us department of health and human services has reported that african americans are also dying from the virus at alarmingly disproportionate rates the risk of a severe coronavirus outcome is increased by high blood pressure and diabetes these are conditions more prevalent among black americans nearly a third of african american adults have high blood pressure compared to 24 of white adults unhealthy life styles cigarette smoking alcohol consumption obesity diabetes high blood pressure and male gender are clusters of cardiometabolic risk factors always accompanying the presence of the metabolic syndrome 68 we are well aware now that major inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of this syndrome 69 adipose tissue at dysfunction monocytes macrophages and phagocyte activity contribute to the proinflammatory milieu with the release of leptin low adiponectin chemokines cytokines circulating inflammatory crp and fibrinogen promoting systemic inflammation and insulin resistance therefore by far the metabolic syndrome is an inflammatory disorder 69 the combined data from the reports of rodriguez et al 49 and petrilli et al 63 seem to indicate perhaps that most symptom-free obese individuals with severe and fatal covid-19 could be metabolically unhealthy 62 or more concerning that non-obese symptom-free individuals with underlying but undetected adipose tissue dysfunction and a low alr with a high adipo-iri index exposed to covid-19 infection are also at high risk for severe and fatal covid-19 outcomes 49 metabolically unhealthy obese and individuals with adipose tissue dysfunction present key proinflammatory conditions that are highly underestimated and rarely diagnosed among symptom-free individuals figure 1 the systemic proinflammatory setting in symptom-free individuals without overt diabetes or hypertension but with metabolically unhealthy obesity or non-obese adipose tissue dysfunction could require hospitalization and progress to a more severe and critical reaction requiring icu intervention in turn this could perhaps contribute to enhance the hyperinflammatory state in symptom-free individuals infected with severe covid-19 triggering multi-organ failure as shown in figure 2we brought attention to two manifestations of a highly complex multifactorial developmental and environmentally dependent pathology of critical importance to human survival 70 although very different in their presentation and transmission the acute communicable covid-19 pandemic mirrors the chronic non-communicable diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects our interest was to emphasize the ties between the intimate molecular immunoinflammatory mechanisms that relate and enhance the morbidity and lethality when covid-19 meets diabetes figure 2 we should focus on how to use all information and scientific data to address both pathologies and study their common underlying pathways for example recent publications highlighted the significance of the two coronavirus receptor proteins angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 also highlighting their dual physiologic effects as transducers of metabolic signals and pathways regulating inflammation renal and cardiovascular physiology and glucose homeostasis 71 this opens the door to consider glucose-lowering agents such as the dpp4 inhibitors as tools to intervene in the interaction of covd-19 and dysglycemic states 72 there is still much to learn important considerations should include if the natural history of the covid-19 infection is different between t1d and t2d individuals how age relates to disease outcomes and severity among patients with or without diabetes and whether antidiabetic medications affect disease progression in infected diabetic individuals given the compelling data related to the two disorders we should not be surprised by the more serious consequences for those with frank diabetes or a dysglycemic state 7374 infected with covid-19 although it is not surprising this relationship is however frightening given the fast transmission rate of sars-cov-2 and the global prevalence of diabetes this unfortunate scenario should motivate the research community to use the current situation though dire to make meaningful progress in preventing and treating both epidemicsdiabetes mellitus dm is a complex chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose absolute and relative insulin deficiency it includes type1 diabetes type 2 diabetes and special type diabetes among them the morbidity of type 2 diabetes was the highest the global prevalence of t2 dm in 2017 is estimated to be 463 billion1 in 2017 the total number of deaths caused by high fasting plasma at all ages was 65 million of which type 2 diabetes accounted for 1 million deaths2 novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is seriously endangering human life and health and property safety march 11 2020 by the world health organization who announced as a global pandemic3 many early studies have found that patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes are more severe and have worse prognosis48 a number of retrospective analysis of patients with covid-19 showed that the prevalence of diabetes patients increased in varying degrees and the condition was usually more serious than that of general patients911 the analysis in china by chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc shows that the mortality combined with diabetic patients is 73 while the overall mortality is 2312 the national institutes of health in italy reported that the prevalence of diabetes in patients who died of sars-cov-2infection was 35513 according to the preliminary data from the american centers for disease control and prevention on march 28 2020 diabetes is the most common basic health condition among the people infected with sars-cov-2 about 109 furthermore it is estimated that 32 of the patients who need to be admitted to icu14 diabetic patients are more likely to suffer from serious infection due to hyperglycemia chronic inflammatory state microcirculation damage and other factors15 it was found that type 2 diabetes may increase the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 in the lung16 the novel coronavirus pneumonia is promoted by ace2 as a binding site of sars-cov-2 but the decrease of ace2 expression may result in severe lung injury after infection17 serious infections serious diseases and glucocorticoids can damage insulin sensitivity so infectious diseases lead to high mortality of diabetic patients18 however covid-19 mortality combined with diabetes is still not clear the duration age gender race and blood glucose control of diabetes may have effect on the mortality of covid-19 our study will solve that by meta-analysis and it is very necessarythe report of this system review plan is in accordance

hui zhouthe world health organization has declared coronavirus sars-cov-2 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 the virus is termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and responsible for outbreak of intense respiratory illness named coronavirus disease covid-19 yuen et al 2020 this infection first appeared in wuhan china and then spread all over the world and reached all continents and almost all countries muniyappa and gubbi 2020sars-cov-2 has a single-stranded rna and was confirmed to cause respiratory infections and lung injury in humans the betacoronavirus family includes sars-covs mers-covs and sars-cov-2 the members of this family share high genetic similarity and induce comparable pathological parameters particularly oxidative stress and inflammatory effect chen 2020 the respiratory system is the primary target of coronavirus members that induce lung injury and dysfunction leading to fatal pneumonia channappanavar and perlman 2017 respiratory dysfunction caused by the continuing outbreak of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is a major concern for diabetic and obese individuals worldwidedespite the low fatality rate caused by covid-19 compared with other earlier coronavirus epidemics produced by sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov diabetic and obese people are at a high risk yang et al 2020 recently it has been reported that diabetes is an important risk factor for the progression and adverse outcome of covid-19 and more attention must be paid to diabetic obese and hypertensive patients particularly considering the rapid deterioration bloomgarden 2020 guo et al 2020 therefore adequate information about the relationship between covid-19 and metabolic syndrome is required for better management of these patientsmelatonin 5-methoxy-n-acetyltryptamine is a neuroendocrine small molecule with a variety of important physiological functions under normal and pathophysiological circumstancesit is an effective antioxidant and has powerful free radical scavenging activity zare javid et al 2020 it also stimulates the messenger rna mrna levels of various antioxidant enzymes melatonin possesses anti-inflammatory capacity and immunomodulatory activity and effectively boosts the immune system in the body reiter et al 2016 these properties suggest the potential therapeutic use of melatonin to improve clinical outcomes in patients accordingly intervention with antioxidants is a potential approach to overcome oxidative stress and attenuate proinflammatory mediators in diabetic and obese patients we anticipated that upregulation of the immune system is a potential intervention to block virus progression and consequences in this context melatonin is a worthy candidate that can be used to strengthen the immune system against covid-19 infection and its related complications in obese and diabetic patientsin metabolic diseases cell death and oxidative stress are strongly related to inflammation and changes in proinflammatory cytokines have a strategic position at the crossroad between oxidative stress and inflammation muriach et al 2014 cytokine dysregulation may be responsible for clinical manifestation and high levels of proinflammatory biomarkers are a feature in diabetic and obese patients moreover several factors have been suggested to explain the increased susceptibility for sars-cov-2 infection in diabetic and obese persons these factors include weakness of the immune system with increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome muniyappa and gubbi 2020 the term inflammatory or cytokine storm was introduced to underscore the overreaction of the bodys immune system and massive production of inflammatory cytokines jose and manuel 2020 the prevalence of virus infection and its clinical consequences are most featured in older age and in individuals with obesity and diabetes this category of population exhibits weak immune activity and increased oxidative stress due to the decline in endogenous antioxidants the levels of inflammatory mediators typically increase with age and metabolic syndrome even in the absence of acute infection or physiological stress cardinali and hardeland 2017these individuals are at a remarkably high risk for hospitalization and death among sars-cov-2-infected patients muniyappa and gubbi 2020obesity is a risk factor for the pathogenesis of diabetes and insulin resistance it is known that cytokines and inflammatory parameters and other substances involved in insulin resistance are increased in obese individuals al-goblan et al 2014 in addition patients with metabolic disorders are more susceptible to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation alicka and marycz 2018 oxidative stress is caused due to the increased generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species over to the ability of the antioxidant system of the body oxidative stress is a major depressant of the immune system in the body it has been reported that patients with t2 diabetes mellitus are vulnerable to infections due to hyperglycemia-induced virulence of various microorganisms dworzaski et al 2020earlier studies have shown that infection with epsteinbarr virus ebv is accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species generation and activation of signaling pathways associated with reactive oxygen species gargouri et al 2011 hu et al 2017 ebv and sars-cov-2 induce an oxidative stress during infection and might contribute to their pathologya recent research reported that sars-cov-2-infected patients with diabetes were at a higher risk of developing severe pneumonia with uncontrolled inflammatory responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism compared with covid-19 individuals without dm guo et al 2020 furthermore serum levels of inflammatory mediators including il-6 and c-reactive protein were remarkably increased compared to those in nondiabetic patients suggesting that diabetic patients are more vulnerable to the high inflammatory wave leading to rapid deterioration guo et al 2020 individuals with diabetes mellitus and severe obesity bmi 40 kgm2 are more likely to be infected and are at a higher risk for complications and death from covid-19 muniyappa and gubbi 2020another recent study reported increased morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with sars-cov-2 infection indicating that glycemic control is essential in individuals with coexistence of covid-19 and diabetes hill et al 2020 similarly a yet another recent report unveiled the interaction between covid-19 infection and diabetes as two global pandemics maddaloni and buzzetti 2020 the authors emphasized that il-6 is a major inflammatory cytokine whose levels are increased in diabetes and contributed to the susceptibility of diabetic patients to covid-19 infection and initiation of serious pathological illness hence deactivation of il-6 receptors is a practical approach for the treatment of covid-19-induced lung dysfunction in diabetes a novel study reported that in stressed conditions it is necessary to improve and optimize the blood glucose management strategy for diabetic patients with covid-19 infection zhou and tan 2020 the authors of that study inferred potential and important reasons for the sensitivity of diabetic patients with covid-19 they demonstrated that a diabetic diet or a personalized diet was unavailable accompanied by the inability of quarantined inpatients to perform exercise due to limited indoor space and poor pulmonary function in addition the anxiety caused by covid-19 induces hyperglycemia miazgowski et al 2018 finally the pancreatic tissue is a potential target of viral infection leading to glucose metabolism disorders yang et al 2010 zhou and tan 2020 furthermore a recent report reviewed the possible mechanisms that play significant roles in diabetes mellitus including the hostviral interactions and the host immune responses muniyappa and gubbi 2020coronaviruses can penetrate cells leading to apoptosis and enhance inflammatory responses signified by the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that help attract inflammatory cells including cd and t helper th-1 cells sars-cov-2 infects immune cells and increases the apoptosis of lymphocytes cd3 cd4 and cd8 t cells leading to lymphocytopenia this results in excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a process termed cytokine storm leading to hyper-inflammation and consequent failure of body organs deng et al 2020 gao et al 2020infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis c virus results in severe inflammation with increased reactive oxygen species production leading to oxidative stress gravier-hernandez et al 2020 similarly oxidative stress-related gene polymorphisms are likely to be associated with hepatitis b virus-induced liver disease suggesting that information on these variations is useful for risk assessment of hbv-induced liver disease ma et al 2019 an experimental animal study demonstrated an important role of reactive oxygen species in the pathology and immune response to respiratory syncytial virus rsv the transcriptional profile of reactive oxygen species -related genes in the respiratory system after rsv infection in the natural host has been discussed recently hofstetter and sacco 2020 zika virus zikv is associated with congenital malformations and a recent research has reported that astrocytes are the targets of zikv infection with zikv induces mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress and dna breakage in human astrocytes ledur et al 2020regarding patients positive with the epsteinbarr virus an analysis of antioxidant enzyme activity demonstrated lower activities of superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gpx in patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity than healthy individuals dworzaski et al 2020 it has also been reported that chronic infections caused by various viruses influence the entire immunity of diabetic patients a previous study reported that oxidative stress was induced in infection with the epsteinbarr virus during the early stages of infection in b lymphocytes and epithelial and lymphoblastoid cell lines the oxidative stress was manifested by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activities of cat and sod suggesting an alteration in the molecular mechanisms promoting cellular resistance to reactive oxygen species lassoued et al 2008 other studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress and factors leading to dna damage induce the expression of ebv lytic genes arvey et al 2012 dworzaski et al 2020 gargouri et al 2009mitochondrial reactive oxygen species is a key player in the induction of pathological inflammation during influenza a virus infection in mice a recent research reported that infection with influenza virus enhanced the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species which induces innate immune inflammation leading to intensification of the viral pathogenesis this mechanism demonstrated the therapeutic potential of antioxidants to treat influenza virus pathology to et al 2020macrophages are essential for innate immune responses and play a remarkable role in protecting animals against viral infections infections of macrophages with infectious bronchitis coronavirus ibv and connecticut a5968 conn-a5968 strains produced intracellular coronavirus-like particles within cells ibv causes respiratory defects with increased macrophage count in the respiratory system of animals when macrophages were infected with ibv and conn-a5968 strains the production of the antimicrobial molecule nitric oxide no was inhibited amarasinghe et al 2017 it was also demonstrated that coronaviruses such as sars-cov-2 can replicate within human macrophages cheung et al 2005viroporins are virus-encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals many viruses including corona viruses encode viroporins which are required for maximal viral replication and virulence as in case of sars-cov castao-rodriguez et al 2018 most corona viruses encode two viroporins e protein and 3a protein which act as ion-conductive pores in experiments with planar lipid bilayers sars-cov encodes for additional viroporin 8a which was reported to have less impact on replication and virulence of sars-cov than the two other viroporins castao-rodriguez et al 2018 they could possibly be responsible for inflammasome activation inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes that can activate caspase-1 which in turn enhances the production of interleukin-1-beta il-1 and interleukin-18 il-18 recent research has reported that viroporin can induce production of il-1 fluxes of potassium hydrogen and calcium ions in addition to reactive oxygen species autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress are involved in this activation farag et al 2020melatonin is a neuroendocrine hormone synthesized and released primarily by the pineal gland melatonin is a multifunctional molecule based on its antioxidant activity direct and indirect free radical scavenging ability to boost the immune system mortezaee et al 2019 and anti-inflammatory actions hardeland 2018melatonin is associated with a variety of signaling mechanisms including the erk and mapk pathways cui et al 2008 sung et al 2018 in addition several cell signaling pathways including erk12-cebp are involved in the regulatory roles of melatonin in t-cell biology ren et al 2017 melatonin also stimulated the sirt1nrf2 signaling pathway to reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced reactive oxygen species generation shah et al 2017 moreover melatonin ameliorates h2o2-induced oxidative stress through modulation of erkaktnfkb pathway moniruzzaman et al 2018 melatonin exerts its action directly or indirectly using specific melatonin receptors mt1 and mt2 on cellular membranes melatonin achieves many of its physiological effects by interacting with membrane mt1 and mt2 receptors and intracellular proteins such as quinone reductase 2 calmodulin calreticulin and tubulin pandi-perumal et al 2008 melatonin mt1 and mt2 receptors are g protein coupled receptors which are expressed in various cells in the body organs pandi-perumal et al 2008 a study using melatonin receptor knock-out mice has indicated an active role of these receptors in the regulation of blood glucose muhlbauer et al 2009 it is also mentioned that melatonin administration normalized metabolic syndrome in elderly hypertensive patients via its receptors shatilo et al 2010blood melatonin levels are continuously decreased with age exhibiting the highest level at childhood and youth periods and the lowest level in older individuals furthermore at nighttime the melatonin levels in plasma are higher than those at daytime during the life span the secretion of melatonin exhibits a circadian rhythm and regulates the sleepawake cycle reutrakul et al 2018 this explains the deterioration of sleep quality in older people moreover this matches and might explain the higher number of infections susceptibility to infection and the severity of covid-19 symptoms in older persons than in young individualsincreased oxidative stress and inflammation are a common feature in patients with diabetes with periodontal diseases in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial supplementation with melatonin was found to significantly increase the serum activities of sod cat and gpx and decrease lipid peroxidation in diabetic patients with periodontal disease this effect was accompanied by lower il-1b levels in melatonin-treated patients than in control individuals zare javid et al 2020 the treated patients were administered 6 mg melatonin confirming a previous study using 5 mg as an immediate- or sustained-released dose in patients with t2 diabetes rybka et al 2016 both these studies indicate that melatonin significantly regulated the antioxidant enzymes and increased the total antioxidant capacity in the body an earlier study reported that melatonin is ubiquitous but shows unequal intracellular distribution including its high concentrations in mitochondria likely aid in its capacity to resist oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis reiter et al 2016 another study reported that melatonin improved the glycemic state and exerted an antioxidant activity by upregulating the gsh content and the activities of sod cat and glutathione-s-transferase in brain gurel-gokmen et al 2018 these and several other studies agree on the effectiveness of melatonin to block oxidative stress inflammation and cell death and improve organ function in several human trials the high-safety profile of melatonin also strengthens this conclusion reiter et al 2016diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia insulin resistance dyslipidemia and an augmented inflammatory state karamitri and jockers 2019 diabetic patients have lower melatonin levels in blood than healthy people reutrakul et al 2018 evidence indicating the ability of melatonin to reduce the development of diabetes is derived from the observation that altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in shift-workers and high illumination level during night are associated with low blood melatonin levels cipolla-neto et al 2014 this research group explained that through its receptors melatonin can regulate glut4 expression and initiate the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its intracellular substrates mobilizing the insulin-signaling pathway cipolla-neto et al 2014 the key role of melatonin receptors in the regulation of glucose metabolism was confirmed using melatonin receptor knock-out mice muhlbauer et al 2009the reduction in melatonin production as in elderly people or those with chronic metabolic diseases induces insulin resistance glucose intolerance sleep disturbance and metabolic circadian disorganization characterizing a state of chronodisruption leading to obesity cipolla-neto et al 2014 these findings indicate that melatonin complementary therapy can play a vital role in reestablishing a more healthy condition of individuals with chronic metabolic diseasesincreased accumulations of fat in body organs and tissues develop inflammation that can cause several metabolic disorders including diabetes hypertension and dyslipidemia due to its antioxidant properties melatonin treatment can improve the inflammatory mechanisms and energy metabolism animal experimental studies have shown that melatonin efficiently decreased the production of blood inflammatory cytokines such as leptin and resistin reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and improved the blood lipid profile farias et al 2019 therefore melatonin was termed as a modulator of glucose metabolism at its pharmacological dose melatonin enhanced the effects of metformin on insulin sensitivity and body weight gain and when given in combination with metformin it exhibited a dual therapy for the treatment of diabetes associated with obesity dantas-ferreira et al 2018 recently the latter research group demonstrated that melatonin has a remarkable therapeutic action in decreasing the obesity-induced inflammatory storm the authors anticipated that melatonin can be used as a low-cost therapeutic agent to improve disorders associated with obesity de farias et al 2019 this confirm previous study that melatonin has antidiabetic and hypolipidemic impact in human and animal model of metabolic syndrome cardinali and hardeland 2017it has been reported that melatonin has immunomodulatory roles with dual proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory actions the proinflammatory effect is exhibited to fight pathogens whereas the anti-inflammatory action is manifested in high-grade inflammation in case such as sepsis oxidative stress and organ injury and also in low-grade inflammation associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases hardeland 2018 this double-edge blade of melatonin is attributed to several mechanisms besides its ability to downregulate proinflammatory cytokine production and upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokine production melatonin exhibits high antioxidant capacity and can downregulate inducible nitric oxide synthases and inhibit neuronal nitric oxide synthases downregulate cyclooxygenase-2 inhibit high-mobility group box-1 signaling and toll-like receptor-4 activation prevent inflammasome nlrp3 activation and inhibit nf-b activation hardeland 2018 in a novel potential therapy using melatonin to prevent and treat obesity caused by systemic inflammatory disease it is reported that melatonin alleviates adipose tissue inflammation by elevating -ketoglutarate and diverting adipose-derived exosomes to macrophages in mice liu et al 2018 based on this information sustaining normal levels of melatonin in elderly individuals and diabetic and obese people is an important strategy to strengthen the bodys defense system and consequently the immune systemmelatonin was found to exhibit effective inhibition of pathological manifestations in cases with viral infections in humans reiter et al 2020 and plants wang et al 2020 as sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered virus there is a shortage of research in the literature which delays the development of effective treatment strategies and in particular the potential effects of melatonin in human or experimental animals against this deadly pathogen however melatonin exerts remarkable antiviral effects on several viruses in humans and animals an early work reported that encephalomyocarditis virus or the semliki forest virus causes severe inflammation in the nervous tissue and result in a high mortality rate melatonin when administered at the pharmacological dose successfully attenuated the inflammation parameters and reduced the number of deaths ben-nathan et al 1995 maestroni et al 1988 a recent report on ebola infection demonstrated that the virus hampers the immune system and initiates blood coagulation with significant inflammation reaction that induces an overwhelmed generation of toxic free radicals and the development of oxidative stress and severe damage in cells and tissue this eventually causes organ and system dysfunction and failure reiter et al 2020 in this regard these authors reported that melatonin can prevent hemorrhagic shock syndrome a major pathological parameter associated with ebola virus infection this action is mediated primarily by the reduction of circulating proinflammatory cytokines melatonin also upregulates heme oxygenase-1 ho-1 which obstructs the replication of the ebola virus anderson et al 2015 recently a research group confirmed that melatonin is an effective safe and low-cost therapeutic option for ebola virus junaid et al 2020it has also been strongly suggested that melatonin can protect against acute lung injury aliacute respiratory distress syndrome caused by virus and other pathogens this is attributed to its well-known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects zhang et al 2020bhuman papillomavirus is associated with oral and genital cancers dsouza and addepalli 2018 shafabakhsh et al 2019 melatonin exerted a defensive impact on oral cancer and oral ulcer the preventive and controlling role of melatonin on oral cancer caused due to hpv was attributed primarily to immunoenhancement by increasing t  b lymphocyte activity increasing monocyte activity increasing natural killer cell activity and increasing the secretion of cytokines il-6 and il-2 which ultimately lead to oncostatic activity dsouza and addepalli 2018 in addition melatonin in combination with indoleamine 23-dioxygenase-1 inhibitor administered as an immunometabolic adjuvant improved the efficacy of immunotherapeutic treatment of hpv-associated tumors moreno et al 2018it is possible that melatonin directly interacts with the sars-cov-2 membrane and its genetic material it has been speculated that melatonin can affect the biological activity of viruses this is supported by the fact that melatonin is a small molecule with amphiphilic nature and can readily cross biological membranes and freely enter all cells and reach subcellular organelles and structures amin et al 2015 in addition there is evidence indicating that melatonin pleiotropy encompasses the regulation of gene expression through the primary epigenetic mechanisms including dna methylation chromatin modification and noncoding rna capote-moreno et al 2019 based on these recent findings comprehensive molecular studies are required to elucidate the ability of melatonin to reverse or inhibit the biological activity of sars-cov-2 in diabetic or obese patients to date there is no direct experimental evidence on the viricidal effect of melatonin but it has indirect antiviral actions due to its anti-inflammatory antioxidant immunomodulatory and immune enhancing characteristics reiter et al 2020 zhang et al 2020bin contrast to aforementioned melatonins immunemodulatory characteristics other agents showed limited effectiveness in modulating immunoreactivity toward viruses for instance statins cannot prevent patients infected with the 2009 h1n1 pandemic influenza from developing severe disease in addition there is no direct evidence was shown that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis might be effective in the therapy of severe influenza-induced cytokine storm liu et al 2016 because of the sequence similarity between the spike proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2shang et al 2020 it was recently validated that sars-cov-2 also uses ace2 as its receptor zhou et al 2020 polyphenols are proved to have immunomodulatory and antioxidant effect in vivo and in vitro however the major obstacle is their bioavailability and its impact on the biofunctionality yahfoufi et al 2018melatonin has several properties suggesting its utility in a variety of circumstances it has high biological safety and exogenous melatonin can be used in a variety of doses even including extreme doses andersen et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a it worth mentioning that a melatonin dose of 310 mgday demonstrated acceptable safety level in clinical trials chen et al 2012 othman et al 2016 seabra et al 2000 zhang et al 2020b adverse events were generally minor short-lived and easily managed foley and steel 2019 in addition to its high-safety profile it can be administered through several routes melatonin constitutes a natural and easy-to-synthesize product that can be found over shelves with long half-timethis review presents a short brief account of recently published papers on the role of melatonin and its potential benefits based on which it can be included as a therapeutic adjuvant in the treatment course of covid-19 patients with chronic diseases a common trend exists between the increased number of sars-cov-2-infected cases and the low levels of blood melatonin in people with chronic metabolic diseases and elderly people these individuals show decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants including antioxidant enzymes and melatonin accompanied by a weak immune system and increased susceptibility to inflammation the ability of melatonin to decrease viral infections in obese and diabetic patients is attributed to its characteristics such as potent antioxidant effects improving the endogenous antioxidant system immunomodulatory and the strong anti-inflammatory capability altogether these features strongly recommend that melatonin can be useful as a therapeutic option for sars-cov-2-infected patients with or without chronic metabolic diseases to improve their health although there is no direct evidence to support the utility of melatonin in the treatment protocols of covid-19 patients extensive data published over the past 50 years recommend its utilitynonenonein december 2019 an acute infectious pneumonia of unknown cause broke out in wuhan and quickly spread throughout the world1

2 the pathogen was identified to be a unique clade from the -coronaviruses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east syndrome mers and was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-23 subsequently this coronavirus-caused pneumonia was defined as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by world health organization who on february 124 on april 18 2020 sars-cov-2 had caused 84180 confirmed cases and more than 4000 death in china globally this virus has spread to more than 200 countries including the united states britain italy south korea and japancovid-19 has a higher transmission rate and a greater risk of mortality in comparison with influenza although the majority of the patients are believed to have a favorable outcome older people with underlying diseases may have a poor prognosis5 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common conditions among the elderly and contributes greatly to the morbidity worldwide moreover numerous studies have shown that diabetic patients are more susceptible to various pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus6 several retrospective studies in wuhan indicated that diabetes was one of the most prevalent comorbidities in covid-19 patients7 8 9 and suggested that diabetics were probably more susceptible to sars-cov-2 and these patients might have a worse prognosisin order to understand whether covid-19 patients with diabetes have a more severe disease progression and a worse prognosis 584 covid-19 patients were studied the data of demographic clinical laboratory radiologic treatments complications as well as clinical outcomes were carefully collected and analyzed our results indicate that diabetes mellitus is significantly associated with poor prognosis of covid-19in this retrospective single-center cohort study we included 584 patients with covid-19 from december 25 2019 to march 20 2020 at the wuhan no7 hospital wuhan no7 hospital was temporarily taken over by zhongnan hospital of wuhan university and it was also the designated hospital for the treatment of covid-19 all adult patients who were diagnosed with covid-19 according to the new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control guideline 7th edition the study was approved by the ethics committee of zhongnan hospital of wuhan university 2020082k all research procedures are performed according to the criteria of declaration of helsinkiwe obtained all the data including demographic clinical laboratory radiological characteristics treatments complications and clinical outcomes from patients electronic medical records all patients were followed up on march 30 2020 the data were carefully reviewed by three independent researchers jian shang qian wang and haiping zhang discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by discussion or a fourth researcher jun linto confirm sars-cov-2s infection throat swab samples were collected from the upper respiratory tracts of all the patients and tested using the rt-pcr or next-generation sequencing technology as described previously pathogen detection was performed by the following four institutions the chinese center for disease control and prevention the chinese academy of medical science the academy of military medical sciences and wuhan institute of virology of the chinese academy of sciences10

categorical variables were presented as frequency rates and percentages  and continuity variables were described using median and interquartile range iqr we used chi-square test or fishers exact test to compare variables between diabetes and non-diabetes groups for categorical data otherwise mann-whitney u test was applied for continuous variables the kaplan-meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the prognosis of covid-19 patients in different groups furthermore multivariate cox proportional hazards analysis was used to analyze the independent prognosis factors for survival in covid-19 patients all statistical analyses were performed using spss software version 220 p value less than 005 was considered statistically significanta total of 584 patients with covid-19 were included in this retrospective study table 1
 the median age was 59 years iqr 25-75 ranging from 14 to 91 years and 307 patients were female 526 the most common symptom at the beginning of the disease was fever 702 followed by cough 606 anorexia 372 fatigue 351 and dyspnea 324 more than half of the patients had one or more comorbidities including hypertension 341 diabetes 144 cardiovascular disease 106 chronic respiratory disease 84 chronic liver disease 58 malignancy 48 and chronic kidney disease 14 according to the initial clinical data 57 98 patients were critical illas shown in table 1 covid-19 patients were divided into diabetes group n84 and non-diabetes group n500 and there were more elderly people in the diabetes group patients with diabetes were more likely to have symptoms such as fatigue 500 p  0003 and dyspnea 429 p  0030 the proportions of diabetes patients with hypertension 631 p  001 and cardiovascular disease 226 p  001 were significantly higher than those of non-diabetes furthermore more critical ill patients were in the diabetes group 202 p  0010laboratory and radiologic findings of patients are described in table 2
 on admission many patients tended to have lymphopenia elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers c-reactive protein  procalcitonin and abnormal levels of neutrophil alanine aminotransferase alt total bilirubin albumin blood urea nitrogen bun serum creatinine cardiac troponin i and d-dimer according to radiologic findings 450 patients 771 presented with bilateral pneumonia and unilateral pneumonia occurred in 67 patients 115compared to non-diabetic patients diabetic patients had higher levels of neutrophils p  0014 total bilirubin p  001 blood urea nitrogen p  0001 cardiac troponin i p  001 c-reactive protein p  0008 procalcitonin p  001 and d-dimer p  0033 and lower levels of lymphocytes p  0032 and albumin p  0035 furthermore diabetic patients had a significant higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia 869 p  0020 figure 1
 these results indicated that covid-19 patients with diabetes had a more severe inflammatory response and lung infiltration which might contribute to their poorer prognosisthe data of treatments complications and clinical outcomes were summarized in table 3
 of the 584 patients 435 patients 745 received antiviral treatment 418 patients 716 received antibiotic 380 patients 651 received traditional chinese medicine 175 patients 299 received corticosteroid and 107 patients 183 received intravenous immunoglobin a total of 57 patients 98 required mechanical ventilation and 38 patients 65 were admitted to icu in terms of complications the most common complication was respiratory failure 261 followed by acute cardiac injury 250 acute kidney injury 90 and acute liver injury 49 in addition a total of 57 patients 98 eventually diedcompared to non-diabetic patients diabetic patients were more likely to receive corticosteroid 417 vs 280 p  0014 intravenous immunoglobin 274 vs 168 p  0032 and mechanical ventilation 167 vs 86 p  0028 patients with diabetes had a higher proportion of complications including respiratory failure 369 vs 242 p  0022 and acute cardiac injury 474 vs 212 p  001 furthermore more patients died in diabetes groups 202 vs 80 p  0001 these above data indicated that the clinical outcomes of diabetic patients were worse than those of non-diabetic patientsthe kaplan-meier method and log-rank test were used in our study to investigate the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 prognosis the results indicated that diabetic patients had a significant lower overall survival rate than non-diabetic patients hr  2761 p  00002 figure 2
 furthermore multivariate cox analysis was performed following adjustment for potential prognostic factors which included the age sex hypertension cardiovascular diseases diabetes chronic respiratory diseases chronic kidney diseases chronic liver diseases acute kidney injury acute liver injury respiratory failure and acute cardiac injury the data showed that diabetes hr 2180 p  0031 and acute kidney injury hr 3520 p  001 were the only two independent prognosis factors for mortality in covid-19 patients table 4
 these results indicate that diabetes is a potential risk factor for the prognosis of covid-19of the 84 diabetic patients 29 had uncontrollable plasma glucose levels and required insulin therapy in subgroup analysis we divided diabetic patients into insulin required n  29 and non-insulin required n  55 groups according to whether they needed insulin table 5
 we found that there were more elderly p  0011 and critical ill p  001 patients in the insulin required group compared to the patients who did not need insulin insulin required diabetic patients had higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase p  0015 c-reactive protein p  0021 and d-dimer p  0043 and a lower level of lymphocytes p  001more patients in the insulin required group received corticosteroid 621 vs 309 p  0010 mechanical ventilation 448 vs 18 p  001 and icu admission 276 vs 18 p  0001 in terms of complications and clinical outcomes the incidence of respiratory failure 655 vs 218 p  001 acute cardiac injury 680 vs 356 p  0013 acute kidney injury 357 vs 19 p  001 and death 517 vs 36 p  001 in the insulin required group was significantly higher than those in non-insulin required group kaplan-meier survival curve showed that the insulin required diabetic patients had a shorter overall survival time hr  2055 p  001 figure 3
diabetes mellitus is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by multiple macrovascular and microvascular abnormities which can affect our bodys response to pathogens6 the relationship between diabetes and infection has always been an important concern of clinicians infectious diseases especially influenza and pneumonia are very common among elderly diabetic patients in addition previous studies had shown that diabetes was a risk factor for the morbidity and mortality of multiple viral infections including 2009 influenza a h1n1 mers-cov and sars-cov15 16 17 however the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 prognosis is rarely reportedin this retrospective cohort study we analyzed data from 584 patients with covid-19 including 84 cases of diabetes and 500 cases of non-diabetes first we compared the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups the results indicate that the proportion of elderly patients in diabetes group is significantly higher than that in the non-diabetes group it is well known that diabetes is an aging disease and previous studies have shown that aging is one of the important risk factors affecting the prognosis of covid-197 therefore a high proportion of elderly patients in diabetes group might suggest a poor clinical outcome furthermore we analyzed the symptoms of the patients at the first visit and found that diabetic patients were more likely to have symptoms of fatigue and anorexia which might eventually lead to poor nutritional status of the patients according to the criteria in the methods we evaluated the disease severity of all the patients and found that there were more critical ill patients in the diabetes group which suggest that diabetic patients are more likely to progress to a severe condition after the infection with sars-cov-2lymphopenia is common in the patients with covid-19 but thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are relatively rare18 previous studies have shown that covid-19 patients especially those with severe conditions have significantly increased levels of serum inflammation-related biomarkers including interleukin 6 c-reactive protein and procalcitonin and these indicators are closely related to the prognosis of the disease7

18 in diabetes hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can promote the synthesis of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules which can exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation in the body19 however it is not clear whether diabetes will further aggravate the inflammatory response in covid-19 patients in order to clarify this question laboratory data was analyzed in our study and the results showed that diabetic patients had higher levels of neutrophils c-reactive protein and procalcitonin and a lower level of lymphocytes in comparison with non-diabetic patients besides lab findings we also analyzed the radiologic data and found that diabetic patients had a significant higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia than non-diabetic patients these results indicate that covid-19 patients with diabetes had more severe inflammatory responses and lung infiltration which might contribute to the worse prognosis of sars-cov-2s infectiond-dimer is a fibrin degradation product and is one of the main markers of coagulation activity20 the high concentration of serum d-dimer is closely related to a variety of thrombotic diseases including myocardial infarction cerebral infraction pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis21 in our study we found that the concentration of serum d-dimer of diabetic patients was significantly higher than that of non-diabetic patients indicating that covid-19 patients with diabetes are more likely to develop a hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic stateboth sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace222

23 it is reported that ace2 is widely expressed in multiple organs including heart respiratory tract liver kidney pancreas and intestine24 which might provide an explanation for why some covid-19 patients have multiple organ dysfunctions in our study we observed that the incidence of respiratory failure and acute cardiac injury in diabetes group were significantly higher than those in non-diabetes group these results suggest that more attention should be paid to respiratory support and heart protection in covid-19 patients with diabetesso far there is no clear evidence to indicate that antiviral treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of covid-19 patients the majority of the patients only received treatments such as oxygen therapy fluid management and respiratory support some received antibiotics corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobin critical ill patients required icu monitoring and mechanical ventilation in our study the diabetic patients were more likely to receive corticosteroids intravenous immunoglobin and mechanical ventilation than non-diabetic patients which indicated that the diabetic patients had a more severe disease progression and needed more advanced therapydespite receiving advanced treatment the mortality of patients in the diabetes group was still significantly higher than that in the non-diabetes group in order to determine the role of diabetes on the prognosis of covid-19 patients kaplan-meier method and survival curve were applied in our study and the results indicate that the diabetic patients had a significant lower overall survival rate than the non-diabetic patients to exclude the influence of other factors multivariate cox analysis was performed and the data showed that diabetes was an independent prognosis factors for the mortality in covid-19 patients thus more intensive monitors should be conducted in diabetic patients to prevent the disease from getting worse aging is one of the important factors affecting the prognosis of covid-19 patients in our study kaplan-meier survival curve showed that patients older than 65 years had a shorter overall survival time hr  5260 p  001 supplementary figure 1
 suggesting that older-age is associated with the poor prognosis of covid-19 however the results of the multivariate analysis do not show that aging is an independent risk factor for covid-19 prognosis probably due to the influence of multiple confounding factors and limited sample size in this studydiabetes patients with uncontrollable plasma glucose levels may have more complications and a worse prognosis usually requiring insulin therapy we divided diabetic patients into insulin required and non-insulin required groups according to whether they needed insulin we found that the incidence of respiratory failure acute cardiac injury acute kidney injury and death in the insulin required group was significantly higher than that in non-insulin required group kaplan-meier survival curve showed that the insulin required diabetic patients had a shorter overall survival time these results indicate that diabetic patients requiring insulin have a higher risk of disease progression and worse prognosis after the infection of sars-cov-2our study has several limitations first a selection bias exits in this retrospective cohort study and more prospective studies are needed second our research is only based on a single center study and more large-scale multi-center researches need to be performed to validate our conclusionsin conclusion diabetes is an independent risk factor for the prognosis of covid-19 diabetic patients should be intensely monitored during treatment especially those who require insulin therapythe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has abruptly reached pandemic proportions sars-cov-2 is a member of the betacoronavirus family as well as sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus since the beginning of 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has dramatically increased worldwide leaping to more than a million by march 2020 1 although the majority of covid-19 patients develop mild to moderate clinical features 2 severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure leading to high death rate may develop notably marked sex differences have emerged in covid-19 prevalence and prognosis in particular the age-specific risk of disease is reported to be significantly higher in males than in females except under the age of 50 years moreover the age-specific risks of death and hospitalization is at least two fold higher in males than in females among all age ranges 3 furthermore patients with advanced age and underlying pathologies mainly hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvd are more prone to experience severe form of the disease 4 even though the overall mortality considerably varies among countries the fatality-rate by age groups displays very similar patterns rising consistently in the 6069-year age group 5 importantly the presence of comorbidities further increases mortality in a sample of 355 patients who died of covid-19 in italy the prevalence of diabetes was 355 5 not so differently from covid-19 the spread of diabetes has known no boundaries and the number of affected people has reached nearly half a billion worldwide 6 the number of deaths attributed to diabetes and its complications was around 42 million in 2019 6 notably more than 65 of diabetic patients are over 65 years old 7 thus although with extremely different connotations covid-19 and diabetes are two pandemics that share the burden of a wide diffusion in the elderly population and a dramatic impact on global mortality and economic health resourcesthis short review is focused on some open questions emerging from the effort to fully understand the link between covid-19 and diabetes mainly in the context of possible harmful or beneficial effects of commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes on the course of covid-19 infectiondiabetes is reportedly a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide a conceivable link between diabetes and infectious diseases has been postulated in particular lower respiratory tract infections are known to be rather common and severe in the elderly with type 2 diabetes t2d 8 although evidence suggests that diabetes is unlikely to significantly increase the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection a higher risk of worse covid-19 progression and outcomes has been observed 9 the mechanisms underlying this association are not completely clear yet but the exacerbated pro-inflammatory cascade and the impaired immune response in diabetic patients with covid-19 are suspected to be crucially involved in particular increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as leukocyte and neutrophil count pro-calcitonin c-reactive protein ferritin and circulating cytokines that trigger the cytokine storm namely il-6 il-8 il-2 receptor tnf- have been detected in diabetic patients with severe covid-19 compared to patients without diabetes 10 furthermore an altered immune response in diabetic patients possibly due to impaired lymphocyte neutrophil and monocytemacrophage function has been long hypothesised especially in the presence of poorly controlled glycaemia 11 12 higher concentrations of d-dimer and fibrinogen hallmarks of severe forms of covid-19 have been also reported in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes suggesting that these patients might be more prone to develop coagulation abnormalities in the course of the infection known to be significantly associated with worse prognosis 10 13in a recent retrospective study involving chinese patients n  904 with moderate severe or critical disease the major risk factors for mortality and poor outcomes were evaluated among the enrolled patients 15 n  136 had diabetes including t2d type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes overall diabetes increased the odds of in-hospital death and poor prognosis diabetic patients were older and had significant alterations of several laboratory parameters associated with poor prognosis compared to patients without diabetes in particular they had higher levels of d-dimer while female diabetic patients had increased ldh and neutrophil count compared to non-diabetic patients cvd was more common in men with diabetes than in non-diabetic men notably in multivariable regression analysis insulin therapy was independently associated with poor prognosis c-reactive protein was the only independent risk factor for either mortality or poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 and diabetes 14 besides this further research is also needed to clarify whether hypoglycaemia might also contribute to adverse outcomes and increased mortality in covid-19 patients with diabetes 15patients with diabetes have high prevalence of high blood pressure and are at increased risk of cvd 16 hence the treatment of hypertension largely includes drug classes that have demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events such as angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs 17 since ace converts angiotensin i into angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and sodium-retentive agent the blockage of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas leads to an effective reduction in blood pressure ace shows homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor to which the transmembrane spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binds allowing the internalization of the virus by the alveolar cells and other cell types 18 ace2 which is clearly not a direct target of ace inhibitors is a ubiquitous mono-carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin ii into the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic angiotensin-17 contrasting its potent vasoconstrictor sodium-retentive pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects indeed angiotensin-17 binding to the mas receptor induces nitric oxide release protecting against tissue injury 19 another known substrate of ace2 is angiotensin i which is converted into angiotensin-19 20 21 the latter is in turn converted into angiotensin-17 by ace therefore competing with angiotensin ii for its binding 22limited animal and in vitro studies have reported an upregulation of ace2 induced by arbs and to a far lesser extent by ace inhibitors predominantly in the heart and in the kidney the effect is partly explained by an increase in local levels of angiotensin ii induced by arbs but not by ace inhibitors 20 indeed arbs block angiotensin ii type 1 at1 receptors and consequently increase the availability of the substrate angiotensin ii which upregulates ace2 21 based on this assumption it has been speculated that the treatment with arbs and ace inhibitors might favour the entry of sars-cov-2 into the lung cells therefore increasing the risk for adverse outcomes and severe forms of covid-19 infectionconversely a beneficial effect of a background therapy with arb on the course of the disease has been supposed two complex mechanisms might support this hypothesis firstly angiotensin ii by binding to its receptor at1 might enhance the shedding of trans-membrane ace2 promoted by adam17 a disintegrin and metalloprotease therefore releasing soluble ace2 locally the soluble form of ace2 is unable to mediate sars-cov-2 internalization as it is no longer annexed to the cell membrane 21 secondly the up-regulation of ace2 probably induced by arbs might not necessarily have negative effects as sars-cov-2 internalization in the lung cells inevitably induces the downregulation of ace2 the increase in its substrate angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory agent might contribute to an exacerbation of lung injury indeed in animal models of lung injury a clear association between the activation of the angiotensin ii-at1 signalling and the severity of lung damage has been observed while the detrimental effects of this cascade are counterbalanced by the activation of the ace2-angiotensin-17-mas receptor axis 23 specifically in models of sepsis or acid aspiration which frequently cause acute lung injury and ards ace2 knockout mice experienced a more severe tissue damage characterized by marked inflammatory cell infiltration increased vascular permeability lung oedema and bleeding compared to wild-type mice similarly angiotensin ii type 2 at2 receptors knockout mice had a more marked lung damage in the same models the injection of recombinant human ace2 protein into ace2 knockout mice considerably decreased the severity of lung injury 24 in line with these findings the pre-treatment with recombinant human ace2 was able to reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injury in a mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection 25 evidence from clinical studies is still rather limited in patients with ards recombinant human ace2 increased angiotensin-17 and decreased angiotensin-ii concentrations even though the study was prematurely discontinued for the lack of clinical improvement 26 overall evidence from animal models suggests a conceivable pneumo-protective role of both ace2 and at2 receptor in the context of lung injury a loss of pulmonary ace2 might therefore have harmful effects exacerbating inflammation and promoting respiratory distress and fibrosis in the same way the activation of ace angiotensin ii and at1 receptor axis might exert detrimental effects worsening lung damage the rationale of raas inhibition is therefore counterbalancing these effects by reducing angiotensin ii and increasing ace2 notably arb and ace inhibitors attenuated lps-induced lung injury in several preclinical studies 2731 recently milne et al analysed gene expression of ace2 ace agtr1 encoding for at1 tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 requested cofactor for the internalization of sars-cov-2 and adam17 in a large number of healthy lung tissue samples collected from patients undergoing lung resection for cancer a significant association between use of ace inhibitors and reduced ace2 gene expression was observed differently the use of arbs was not linked to relevant changes in ace2 expression but was significantly correlated to increased ace and decreased agtr1 expression 32 although these findings are quite in contrast with data from animal studies it should be highlighted that gene expression rather than protein concentration was analysed and that the collected tissue samples did not exhibit lung injury or ards covid-19 results in severe lung damage and an imbalance of the raas system in this context cannot be excluded recently in a pilot study covid-19 patients were found to have higher levels of circulating angiotensin ii compared to healthy subjects and a correlation between angiotensin ii concentration and the severity of the disease was observed as well 33 thus the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs might be very different in extremely damaged context and should be therefore explored in animal models of covid-19mounting evidence from recent clinical studies suggests that raas inhibitor use is not related to an increased risk of covid-19 infection or poor outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 18472 patients screened for covid-19 test positivity was not significantly associated with ace inhibitor or arb therapy 34 similarly in a us study no relationship emerged between prior ace inhibitor or arb use and the increased likelihood of a positive sars-cov-2 test result adjusting for relevant confounding factors 35 in an italian community-based casecontrol study no association was found between ace inhibitor or arb treatment and covid-19 infection although the use of these drugs was rather frequent due to high prevalence of cvd 36 overall these findings excluded an increased risk of covid-19 infection in patients already treated with raas inhibitorsother studies have evaluated the link between covid-19 progression and raas inhibitor therapy in a recent korean population-based cohort study involving 5179 covid-19 patients the use of ace inhibitors or arbs was not associated with a higher mortality risk after adjustment for confounders 37 in a recent systematic review including a total of n  23565 covid-19 patients from different countries ace inhibitor or arb use was not associated with increased severity of covid-19 illness 38 interestingly in a meta-analysis of more than 19000 covid-19 patients from seven cohort studies and five casecontrol studies the use of raas inhibitors was not linked to a higher risk of covid-19 infection severity or mortality whereas mortality risk was significantly lower in patients treated with ace inhibitors or arbs compared to those treated with other antihypertensive drugs 39taking together data from observational studies indicates that raas inhibitor therapy is unlikely to have a negative impact on the course of the infection however whether patients with covid-19 might take advantage of initiating these drugs or not in terms of disease progression and outcomes should be explored in clinical trials which are still ongoingcvd is a well-known major complications of diabetes the risk of developing cvd is 2- to fivefold higher in patients with t2d than in non-diabetic patients mainly due to diabetes-related coronary atherosclerosis 40 in addition diabetic cardiomyopathy may occur independently of coronary artery disease likely developing from t helper 1 driven responses within the cardiomyocyte 41 42 besides the common clinical features of covid-19 cardiovascular damage may occur in nearly 12 of patients 43 being a cause of major concern due to a high related mortality the mechanisms underlying this complication are largely unknown the direct viral damage and the destabilization of coronary plaques reportedly are suspected to play a consistent role notably in a sample of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al observed that the presence of background coronary heart disease or cardiomyopathy was associated with frequent occurrence of myocardial damage highlighted by a marked increase in serum troponin t in the course of the disease 44 accordingly mortality was considerably higher among patients with myocardial injury and concomitant cvd 694 than in patients without cvd 375 remarkably a considerable percentage of patients displaying myocardial injury had diabetes 30 compared to patients without myocardial injury 89 myocardial injury may therefore contribute to the poorer outcomes observed in diabetic patients with covid-19 45 of note patients with myocardial injury were more prone to develop malignant arrhythmias ards coagulopathy and acute kidney injury which explained high mortality 44 importantly ace inhibitors and arbs were broadly used in patients with myocardial injury but mortality did not significantly differ between treated and non-treated patients although consistent evidence excluding harms or suggesting benefits of raas inhibitors on covid-19 patients with hearth injury is lacking most arbs were able to increase ace2 expression in the hearts of animal models of arterial hypertension 46 even in this pathological context the possible effects of these drugs should be further elucidated as the down-regulation of ace2 in cardiomyocytes and in blood vessels induced by sars-cov2 internalization might exacerbate myocardial injury and endothelial dysfunction compromising heart function in patients with diabetes and underlying cvd 20 47in addition patients with t2d have high rate of lipid alterations and statins are the first line therapy for dyslipidaemia remarkably evidence from preclinical studies suggests that statins might modulate ace2 expression in several tissues including the heart it has been observed that atorvastatin increased ace2 protein expression in the heart and in the kidney of rabbits with atherosclerosis 48 in another study diabetic rats displayed significantly lower expression of ace2 and impaired systolic and diastolic function compared to control rats and the combined treatment with insulin and fluvastatin was associated with higher levels of ace2 compared to non-treated diabetic rats 49ace2 is a multi-substrate enzyme and is a targeted by several molecules although extremely limited there is evidence in animal studies that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ppar- agonists which are insulin-sensitizer drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes t2d might increase the expression of ace2 in different tissues in an animal model of hypertension the insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone modulated the ace2angiotensin-17angiotensin ii axis in aortic tissue and lowered blood pressure by increasing the expression of ace2 50 similarly in high fat diet fed rats an animal model of obesity pioglitazone increased the expression of ace2 in insulin-sensitive tissues liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle likely through the modulation of renin-angiotensin system 51ace2 is widely distributed in human tissues and remarkably its expression was found to be even lower in the lung than in other sites 4 hence other mediators are thought to play a role in facilitating sars-cov-2 infection the priming by the serine protease tmprss2 is requested for the binding of ace2 and the internalization of sars-cov-2 tmprss2 cleaves the s protein in s1 and s2 subunits a necessary step for membrane fusion and viral internalization which contextually drags ace2 into the alveolar cells 18 in light of this both antibodies targeting s-protein and tmprss2 inhibitors might prevent sars-cov-2 entry in lung cell 18 individuating other possible candidate co-receptors is therefore of great importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to contrast the infectiondpp4 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface exopeptidase with important metabolic functions it mainly regulates the bioactivity of gut-derived hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide gip they stimulate insulin secretion in response to oral glucose administration known as the incretin effect 52 the dpp4 inhibitors dpp4i are commonly used drugs for the treatment of t2d they prevent the degradation of incretins by inhibiting the catalytic activity of dpp4 as a result -cell insulin secretion is potentiated and glycaemia is significantly reduced independently of its catalytic function dpp4 displays inflammatory and immune functions 53 indeed it is expressed mainly by t-lymphocytes and is involved in their activation and proliferation 54 interestingly pro-inflammatory factors significantly increase dpp4 expression in circulating immune cells 55 unlike sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which binds to ace2 to entry into lung cells dpp4 is the functional receptor for mers-cov 56 hence several mouse and human monoclonal antibodies preventing protein s binding to dpp4 have given promising results for the treatment of mers 57 of note it has been recently reported that dpp4 shares patterns of expression with ace2 in the lung precisely in alveolar type 2 cells the main target of sars-cov-2 58 vankadari et al have recently set up a docking model of dpp4 and the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 59 they predicted several dpp4 residues that might be involved in the interaction with sars-cov-2 s1 domain of the spike protein also targeted by other coronaviruses that enter the host cells through the functional receptor dpp4 however further validation is needed to draw conclusions and to establish whether the possible adhesion between dpp4 and spike protein may play a role in sars-cov-2 infection consequently there are some important issues to be addressed before claiming possible beneficial effects of dpp4 modulation on covid-19 60 according to data from chen et al in patients with diabetes and moderate-severe covid-19 the use of dpp4i did not significantly impact on mortality and clinical outcomes 14the presence of diabetes considerably influences the course of covid-19 infection being a risk factor for poor outcomes in limited preclinical studies ace2 expression was found to be modulated by several players in different tissues most of them are largely employed in the treatment of diabetes such as antihypertensive and to a considerably lesser extent insulin-sensitizers and statins in light of this the potential harmful or protective effects of these treatments in covid-19 infection might be an interesting soil for further research to date data supporting that these drugs clearly interfere with sars-cov-2 access in lung cells or in other tissues are completely lacking it should be stressed that in the absence of evidence from consistent clinical studies the discontinuation or the adoption of these therapies in the attempt to influence the course of the infection is strongly discouragedcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and it has emerged as a rapidly spreading communicable disease affecting individuals worldwide on march 19 2020 there were 209839 confirmed cases 81174 in china and 128665 outside of china and covid-19 has led to 8778 deaths globally1 which has posed a serious threat to human safetythe population is generally susceptible to this coronavirus especially those with diabetes who are more vulnerable to the disease2 several published studies have reported that 12 to 22 of covid-19 patients have comorbid diabetes37 and a report of 72314 patients with covid-19 published by the chinese center for disease control and prevention found increased mortality in people with diabetes 23 overall and 73 patients with diabetes8 in addition zhous research results also revealed that the risk of in-hospital death was 285 times higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes7 obviously the presence of diabetes is associated with increased mortality therefore the blood glucose management of diabetic patients plays an important role in reducing mortality this case presentation describes a successful experience with blood glucose management in a severe covid-19 patient with diabetesa 64-year-old woman with covid-19 was admitted to our hospital on february 19 2020 due to productive coughing for 8 days without any obvious cause the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 rna test was positive and a chest computerized tomography scan revealed that both lungs had multilobe patchy density with an increased shadow infectious lesions suspicious viral pneumonia lung involvement  and pneumonectasis the heart was enlarged predominantly in the left ventricle the aorta was hardened and mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged a physical examination at admission revealed a body temperature of 367c a pulse of 90 beats per minute a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute a blood pressure of 11070 mm hg and an arterial oxygen saturation of 90 with oxygen of 7 lmin the breath sounds of both lungs were thick with wet rales initial laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 74  10 9l neutrophil ratio of 772 and lymphocyte ratio of 134 urine sugar     and acetone bodies  she was diagnosed with covid-19 severe infection and type 2 diabetes lopinavir and ritonavir were given orally for antiviral therapy as well as interferon alpha inhalation on the second day after admission the biochemical test revealed multiple abnormal results blood glucose 174 mmoll interleukin-6 6131 pgml erythrocyte sedimentation rate 75 mmh etc the results of blood gas analysis indicated that the partial pressure of oxygen was 84 mm hg with oxygen 8 lmin and the oxygenation index was less than 200 mm hg therefore she was transferred to the intensive care unit on february 20 2020 with the diagnosis of covid-19 critical infection and type 2 diabetes and high-flow oxygen therapy was given no mechanical ventilation on the second day of intensive care unit admission the patients vital signs were relatively stable except for abnormal postprandial blood glucose 299 mmoll at 1730 and the peripheral blood glucose level was 222 mmoll at 1830 insulin 500 ml saline  insulin 25 iu was used to control blood glucose and the transfusion speed was adjusted according to the level of peripheral blood glucose based on the patients disease situation we implemented comprehensive measures to control blood glucose while actively treating covid-19 infectionfirst we established a multidisciplinary team including specialists in critical care respiratory endocrinology and nursing and discussed treatment and care plans on a daily basis given the postprandial and nocturnal blood glucose of the patient were relatively high and oral hypoglycemic agents could not be effective in controlling the patients blood glucose therefore insulin was used for the patient based on the current blood glucose condition endocrine experts recommended a predinner subcutaneous injection of 5 to 15 iu insulin hspart and 10 to 28 iu insulin glargine injection before sleeping the dose of insulin was adjusted daily according to the patients blood glucose to maintain a fasting glucose level 6 to 8 mmoll and a postprandial blood glucose level of 8 to 14 mmollsecond an individualized diabetic diet plan was formulated for the patient by dietitians and endocrinologists to degrade the blood glucose fluctuation caused by foodthird medical staff tailored an early activity plan for the patient which mainly included the following 3 aspectsfourth the patient was assisted in maintaining good mental healthfifth we monitored blood glucose changes closely according to 7 time points before and 2 hours after 3 meals before sleep and during the night we designed a blood glucose monitoring form to record the results after each measurement and told the patient the specific blood glucose value every time aiming to remind her to pay attentionafter implementing the comprehensive measures mentioned above without adverse or unanticipated events the patients blood glucose gradually became stable fig 1 she was discharged from the hospital on march 10 2020 after 2 consecutive negative nucleic acid tests for novel coronavirus normal blood glucose levels and achieving a satisfactory condition after the patient was discharged from the hospital she was followed up by professional medical staff to monitor her blood glucose fluctuations and covid-19 related condition and telemedicine wechat was used for remote guidancethe ethics committee of the affiliated hospital of zunyi medical university guizou china approved the study protocol and informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case reportto our knowledge this is the first report to share experience with blood glucose management in a severe covid-19 patient with diabetes the patient recovered and was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization by comprehensive treatment and nursing measuresdata about covid-19 in patients with diabetes are limited at present kulcsars research revealed that diabetes was associated with greater weight loss and greater pulmonary inflammation9 another study published by the chinese center for disease control and prevention also showed that the overall mortality of covid-19 patients was 23 while the number was 73 in those patients with diabetes8 it is obvious that diabetics have a higher risk of lung infection and death than their counterparts meanwhile blood glucose control in covid-19 patients with diabetes is difficult because of stress and anxiety condition210 pancreatic tissue as a potential target for the virus11 and the inability for quarantined patients to perform exercise due to space constraints or poor pulmonology condition12 therefore great attention should be paid to controlling patients blood glucose levels to reduce the complications and mortality caused by diabetesfor this patient we established a multidisciplinary team and closely monitored her blood glucose level and formulated a series of measures including an individualized diabetes diet early activities psychological care etc obviously the measures undertaken resulted in the desired effects in the process of treating and caring for covid-19 patients with diabetes it is necessary to pay attention to the following issues first when patients blood glucose fluctuates greatly it is recommended to report to an endocrinologist before injecting insulin to determine whether the insulin dose needs to be adjusted second diabetes diets are different from patients daily eating habits therefore it is extremely important to perform good health education and to obtain the patients support and cooperation in order to enhance their compliance third early activities should be carried out step by step according to patients individual situations and should be implemented while ensuring patient safety fourth in regard to psychological care it is important to understand patients family backgrounds educational levels hobbies and other information only by knowing patients basic information can medical staff implement individualized and targeted psychological carethis case showed that the comprehensive measures performed by a multidisciplinary team achieved good treatment effects on a covid-19 patient with diabetes targeted treatment and nursing methods should be performed based on patients actual situations in clinical practiceinvestigation rujun hu xiaoli yuan fang chen jin li and di huangwriting  original draft rujun hu huiming gao and bao fuwriting  review  editing zhixia jiang and deyu

between 1 march and 11 may 2020 onethird of people with covid19 who died in hospital in england had diabetes after adjusting for confounders the odds of dying in hospital with covid19 for people with diabetes compared with people without diabetes were 286 with type 1 diabetes and 181 with type 2 diabetes
4
 overall deaths in people with diabetes in england have more than doubled during the covid19 epidemic hyperglycaemia and obesity in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes were independently associated with increased covid19 mortality

diabetes is common in older people social isolation reduced intellectual stimulation and reduced physical activity increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people one us analysis concluded we found that social disconnectedness predicted higher amounts of perceived isolation which in turn predicted higher amounts of depression and anxiety symptoms in the reverse direction depression and anxiety symptoms predicted higher amounts of perceived isolation which in turn predicted higher amounts of social disconnectedness
17

many supporting resources during the covid19 pandemic are online and while many older people are it proficient some are not a nursing journal commented there is a need to recognise that older people who previously had not reported being socially isolated and lonely may be disproportionately affected by the requirements of social isolation due to covid19 because of the removal of social contacts which may have occurred during grocery shopping attending community groups and places of worship and other daytoday activities

httpswwwnhsemployersorgnews202004newstaffhealthandwellbeingsupport accessed 14 may 2020on 31 december 2019 the world health organisation who was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in wuhan city hubei province china on 12 january 2020 it was announced that a novel coronavirus had been identified 32 coronaviruses are a large family of viruses and although most are responsible for mild disease such as the common cold they have also been responsible for more severe disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov in 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov in 2012 38having declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern who named the syndrome caused by this novel coronavirus covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 40 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 infection appears remarkably heterogeneous ranging from very mild symptoms to multi-organ failure and deaththere is a perception that people with diabetes are at higher risk both of infection and severe disease from covid-19 27 people with type 1 diabetes who have glucose values close to target may not be at greater risk of developing sars-cov-2 23 similarly as evidence accumulates that many people infected with covid-19 remain asymptomatic 40 it remains uncertain exactly what additional risk pre-existing diabetes poses although the risk of contracting covid-19 may be no greater viral infections can cause more severe symptoms and complications in people with diabetes 24 it should also be noted that a number of people with diabetes are at increased risk due to concomitant immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation 39early reports from wuhan province revealed that those with diabetes mellitus were over-represented among the most severely ill patients with covid-19 16 19 this finding is in keeping with an analysis of people hospitalised by sars-cov where even transient hyperglycaemia was associated with increased mortality 41 diabetes was also identified as being one of the most common comorbidities in a case series of 5700 patients in the new york city area requiring hospitalisation for sars-cov-2 35proposed mechanisms to explain the observed association between diabetes and sars-cov-2 include chronic inflammation an impaired immune response increased coagulation activity and direct pancreatic islet cell injury 20 well-controlled diabetes is associated with better outcomes than poorly controlled diabetes 46 but even short-term hyperglycaemia can stun the innate immune system 22 emerging evidence suggests that in the context of covid-19 acute hyperglycaemia may be a greater risk factor for adverse outcomes than a diagnosis of diabetes 6the sars-cov-2 pandemic highlights the importance of understanding shared disease pathophysiology particularly where it might inform therapeutic choices for people with diabetes emerging data suggests that sars-cov-2 is also common in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease although the prevalence rate has varied in different studies as well as globally 37 obesity is also a risk factor for more severe covid-19-related illness 14 in a meta-analysis of eight studies n  46248 the odds ratio of severe sars-cov-2 was not significantly higher in patients with diabetes unlike hypertension and cardiovascular disease 42 it may therefore be more appropriate to say that complications and co-morbidities linked to diabetes are associated with a higher mortality rate than the presence of diabetes per se 17 the apparent association with worse outcomes might also reflect the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in older people 7angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is now established as the sars-cov receptor but with conflicting data as to its translational relevance 43 a role for ace2 in explaining the association between cardiovascular disease in diabetes and sars-cov-2 has been suggested ace2 expression is reduced in people with diabetes possibly as a result of glycosylation but expression is increased in patients taking ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers 30 speculation around possible adverse or protective effects has not proven helpful and people prescribed ace inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers have been advised to continue taking them 15 membrane-associated dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also functions as a coronavirus receptor 33 but there is currently no evidence to support clinically meaningful effects on immune function through dpp4 inhibition 14acute viral infection has previously been linked to the rapid development of transient insulin resistance 36 infection with covid-19 is also generally associated with an increased insulin requirement 17there are many unanswered questions regarding the course of clinical recovery following sars-cov-2 and it is of interest that diabetes appears to be associated with increased time for viral clearance 10covid-19 will also impact on the health of people with diabetes who are not infected with the virus but find that their clinical care is compromised because of service disruption clinical teams have been challenged to fulfil their general responsibilities and prioritise acute care in relation to covid-19 whilst ensuring that essential diabetes care continues 24people with diabetes continue to require emergency admissions and medical management and specialists have an important role to play expediting treatment and minimising length of stay 29 many inpatient diabetes services have looked to increase their capacity in recognition of the reported association between diabetes and hospitalisation with covid-19 infection and to mitigate against the impact of a potentially reduced workforcedirection has been given to minimise outpatient attendances with movement towards virtual consultations including support for those recently discharged from hospital to reduce the risk of readmission community services should not underestimate the importance of their contributions to maintaining diabetes care triaging of clinic lists supports the identification of those patients who might still require face-to-face review specialist teams should also acknowledge that clinic postponement will equate to cancellation in a proportion of cases traditional reliance on biochemical parameters to inform management decisions in diabetes does mean that access to phlebotomy services must also be considered where useful information cannot be obtained from shared data 29secondary care services that may need to continue at close to full capacity include multidisciplinary diabetic foot services and pregnancy and diabetes services the international working group on the diabetic foot has looked to remind clinicians that most patients with diabetic foot disease do not need to be hospitalised 21 inpatient teams should also ensure that acute foot infection is not missed as non-specific symptoms are attributed to sars-cov-2 the precautionary identification of pregnant women as being at higher risk of severe covid-19-related illness has led to the rapid implementation of remote antenatal care including diabetes management modifications have also been made to the screening pathway for gestational diabetes 34national and locally driven crisis management plans must look to manage anxiety about the health of clinical staff and the people they care for but also around redeployment and service reconfiguration redeployment and new ways of working will inevitably impact the education and training of healthcare providers in diabetes management and alternative approaches will need to be adoptedthe longer-term healthcare impact of social lockdown may not be apparent for some time in the short term interruption of daily activities including diet and exercise may have a significant impact on glucose control as may anxiety and sleep disturbance structured diabetes education has been recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence nice since 2003 13 much of this is delivered through group education which has been suspended and may not be able to restart for some timewhile technology companies have been quick to reassure users around their supply chains 3 centres where diabetes technology supplies have traditionally been delivered to the clinical site rather than directly to users have had to recognise the additional risk this carries companies have agreed to extend warranties for insulin pumps but have also offered remote pump upgrade services where appropriateinitial insights suggested that covid-19 infection increased the risk of emergency states of hyperglycaemia with ketones diabetic ketoacidosis dka and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state 28 these atypical presentations have challenged inpatient diabetes teams and led to some anxiety around the prescription of sodiumglucose co-transporter 2 sglt2 inhibitors it remains important that people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes follow the sick day rules should they become unwell from any illnesssglt2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and renal benefits in people with type 2 diabetes but are associated with a small but increased risk of ketoacidosis there are to date only anecdotal reports of ketoacidosis in patients with sars-cov-2 taking sglt2 inhibitors but they should be suspended in any acute medical admission vomiting or dehydration 2 metformin should also be used with caution in unwell patients interestingly metformin has been proposed to have immunomodulatory actions 8 glucagon-like peptide  1 glp1 receptor agonists also exert anti-inflammatory actions and may even attenuate pulmonary inflammation 44 although the short-term safety of glp1 agonists has been demonstrated in critically unwell patients 26 there is still insufficient experience to make recommendations around their use in patients with sars-cov-2with perhaps the exception of sglt2 inhibitors most patients with mild covid-19 symptoms and normal oral intake can continue their usual anti-hyperglycaemic medications review of glucose-lowering medications should be carefully considered given the possible implications of increased glycaemic variability 9 insulin has been used most extensively in the management of hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients 14 insulin also exerts anti-inflammatory actions 18challenges in fluid replacement in dka due to concerns over acute respiratory distress syndrome and with the availability of infusion pumps for intravenous insulin administration have also been reported 28 here subcutaneous insulin regimes may prove helpful in the management of hyperglycaemia where tissue perfusion has not been compromisedanalysis of capillary blood glucose tests in patients with sars-cov-2 admitted to a medical centre in wuhan suggested suboptimal adherence to current best practice for the management of hyperglycaemia 45 this is perhaps not surprising given the pressure on healthcare systems and the increased exposure of healthcare staff associated with frequent capillary blood glucose monitoring and adjustment of insulin infusions but emerging evidence suggests that good glycaemic control is associated with improved outcomes in patients hospitalised with sars-cov-2 46 automated closed-loop insulin-delivery systems have been proven safe and effective in non-critical care environments 4 the feasibility of fully automated closed-loop glucose control has also been studied in critical illness 25 and may be an option the finding that patients admitted with sars-cov-2 often developed acute hyperglycaemia following hospitalisation suggests that an opportunity exists for more interventional glycaemic management 6the prevalence of diabetes or stress hyperglycaemia in people hospitalised with covid-19 infection and recognition that improved glycaemic control might improve outcomes and reduce length of stay in patients with sars-cov-2 have underlined the importance of specialist inpatient diabetes teams to acute carethe current pandemic has also highlighted opportunities for continuing and expanding innovations in the delivery of diabetes care through virtual consultations between healthcare providers and people with diabetes and the use of diabetes technology 14 crisis management has created unprecedented interest in remote care from both patients and providers and removed many long-standing regulatory barriers the us food and drug administration has also allowed the use of personal blood glucose meters and continuous glucose monitoring devices in hospital for the duration of the pandemic 1 12virtual consultations might also support people with diabetes to be seen by the right person at the right time instead of waiting months between routine clinic appointments this might be a physician specialist nursediabetes educator dietician or clinical psychologist 31while group face-to-face structured diabetes education may not be possible for some time there are opportunities to pilot alternative forms of delivery patient-led remote models of structured diabetes education have been reported to improve both uptake and clinical outcomes the digital version of desmond an evidence-based type 2 diabetes structured education programme was made free to everyone with type 2 diabetes in the uk in april 2020 11 bertie online offers fully remote diabetes structured education for people with type 1 diabetes 5enforced service redesign through this pandemic will also enable other innovations in diabetes care which might only become apparent over the coming months this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authorsthe disease burden of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars cov-2 has been increasing continuously with more than a million confirmed patients and more than 45 thousand deaths globally 1 with a high prevalence of diabetes it is important to understand the special aspects of covid-19 infection in people with diabetes this becomes even more important as most parts of the world are seeing restrictions on mobility of patients in order to contain the pandemic recently our group has published an article highlighting special considerations in the management of diabetes in todays times with covid-19 pandemic 2 much more data from various parts of world has accumulated since then about the association between diabetes and covid-19 management of diabetes in those with covid-19 infection and innovative strategies for medical consultation in view of limited access to healthcare facilities for patients with chronic diseasesthis review aims to collate currently available data about diabetes and covid-19 infection it specifically looks at the relation between diabetes and covid-19 in terms of epidemiology pathophysiology and therapeutics the review is updated

antidiabetic therapy up to april 2 2020 full texts of the retrieved articles were accesseddiabetes and associated complications can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during acute infections due to suppressed innate and humoral immune functions the levels of glycated hemoglobin hba1c  9 have been linked to a 60 increased risk of hospitalization and pneumonia-related severity during bacterial infection 3 past viral pandemics have witnessed the association of diabetes to increased morbidity and mortality diabetes was considered as independent risk factor for complications and death during 20022003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-1 4 similarly the presence of diabetes tripled the risk of hospitalization and quadrupled the risk of intensive care unit icu admission during influenza a h1n1 infection outbreak in 2009 5 during the 2012 outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov diabetes was prevalent in nearly 50 of population and the odds ratio or for severe or critical mers-cov ranged from 72 to 157 in diabetic cohort 6 as compared to overall population mortality rate in patients with mers who had diabetes was 35 78emerging data suggests that covid-19 is common in patients with diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease cvd although the prevalence rate varied in different studies as well in country-wise data in the pooled data from the 10 chinese studies n  2209 on characteristics of comorbidities in patients with covid-19 singh et al 9 have reported a prevalence of hypertension diabetes and cvd in 21 11 and 7 patients respectively similarly in a meta-analysis of 8 trials that included 46248 covid-19 patients yang et al 10 reported a prevalence of 17 8 and 5 for hypertension diabetes and cvd respectively in patients with covid-19 epidemiology working group of chinese center for disease control and prevention that investigated 20 982 patients of covid-19 have shown that hypertension diabetes and cvd were associated in nearly 13 5 and 4 of patients respectively 11 in contrast an italian study by onder et al found diabetes in nearly 36 while cvd was associated in nearly 43 of 355 patients admitted with covid-19 12 similarly in a small study of 24 patients from united states bhatraju et al 13 reported diabetes to be associated with 580 patient with covid-19 while the study from the covid-19 surveillance group of italy n  481 has shown that 34 patients with covid-19 had diabetes who died the covid-19 response team from centers for disease control and prevention cdc usa reported a prevalence of 11 from the data of 7162 covid-19 patients 1415 table 1

mortality however this association of diabetes and mortality was no longer significant after a multivariate regression analysis nevertheless in a bivariate cox regression analysis wu et al 24 demonstrated a hr of 158 95 ci 080 to 313 p  019 for death in patients with diabetes with covid-19in a summary report of 44672 patients of covid-19 the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported a case fatality rate cfr of 23 1023 deaths among 44672 confirmed cases however the cfr was as high as 105 in patients with cvd 73 in diabetes and 60 in hypertension 29 based on these findings and acknowledging the higher morbidities and mortality associated with comorbidities researchers have recently proposed that the course of treatment and prognosis of covid-19 should be stratified based on the absence or presence of co-morbidities in to type a b and c while type a represents covid-19 patients with pneumonia with no comorbidities type b denotes covid-19 pneumonia with comorbidities and type c denotes covid-19 pneumonia with multi-organ dysfunction 30ace-2 receptors are expressed in pancreatic islets and infection with sars cov-1 has been seen to cause hyperglycaemia in people without pre-existing diabetes hyperglycaemia was seen to persist for 3 years after recovery from sars indicating a transient damage to beta cells 40 though the similar effect has not been reported in covid-19 it may be important to monitor blood glucose levels in acute stage and during follow upthere is no data on the differential effects of oral antidiabetic drugs on the disease course in covid-19 metformin has antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects by virtue of inhibition of amp activated protein kinase and has shown protective role in pneumonia in mouse models 41 in one study in patients with tuberculosis patients treated with metformin had better survival than those who did not receive metformin 42 in a median 62 years of follow up of 5266 patients with diabetes mendy et al 43 showed that metformin was significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality in patients with chronic lower respiratory diseases hr 030 95 ci 010 to 093 even after the adjustment for multiple confounding factors in a study of 4321 patients with a follow up of 2-year period ho et al 44 showed metformin users had a significantly lower risk of death hr 046 95 ci 023 to 092 compared with non-metformin users in patients with coexistent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes thiazolidinediones tzd seen to increase the risk of pneumonia in a study when compared to sulfonylureas 45 experimental studies suggest that pioglitazone reduces steatohepatitis by increasing the ace-2 expression in liver tissues 46 this purported increase in ace-2 expression and its relation to covid-19 has led some researchers to propose avoiding tzd in patients with diabetes and covid-19 experimental studies also suggest that liraglutide a glp-1 receptor agonist increases the ace-2 expression in lungs in type 1 diabetic rat and improves right ventricular hypertrophy 47 implications of these findings in the current context of covid-19 and its relation to anti-diabetic drugs is not yet fully cleardipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 are tissue oligopeptides involved in multiple biological processes that include control of the activity of growth factors chemokines and bioactive peptides and t-cell activation beside regulating glucose metabolism 48 the relationship of coronavirus to this cellular type-ii transmembrane protein dpp4 cd26 has generated a great interest recently dpp4 serves as the receptor for mers-cov in the same way as ace-2 is the receptor for sars cov and sars cov2 4950 experimental studies have suggested that certain polymorphisms of dpp-4 are associated with reduced chance of mers-cov infection 51 this finding might explain the perplexing absence of mers-cov cases in africa despite the presence of virus in camels presumably because of frequent presence of protective polymorphisms of dpp-4 in africans 51 moreover this has generated an immense interest whether use of dpp4 inhibitors dpp4i can reduce the viral entry of mers-cov in one in vitro study sitagliptin vildagliptin and saxagliptin could not block the coronavirus viral entry into cells 52though ace-2 is recognized as the main receptor for sars cov-2 a recent modeling study did not rule out its interaction with cd26 or dpp4 53 moreover a possible interaction of dpp4 and renin-angiotensin system ras pathways seems to be plausible although not completely studied interestingly dipeptidyl aminopeptidase i-iii cleaves the angiotensin ii 18 to angiotensin iii 28 and iv 38 which has cascading favorable effect through angiotensin-4 at-4 receptors similarly various endo- and oligo-peptidase cleaves angiotensin i 1-10 directly to angiotensin 17 which has a very favorable cascading effect this suggest that a plausible interaction of non-specific dpp-4i with ace-2 is theoretically possible and therefore this area needs a future researchin this regard some of the studies found that co-administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace-i with dpp4 inhibitors led to an increased sympathetic tone and a consequent adverse hemodynamic effect 54 55 56 there has been an interaction observed between ace-i and vildagliptin where a 4- to 5-folds increased risk of angioedema was noted possibly due to the diminished degradation of bradykinin or substance p 57 in contrast in the experimental study sitagliptin was shown to inhibit ace which could partially explain the purported beneficial cv effects 58dpp4 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory infections however these agents have not been shown to lead to increased risk of pneumonia 45 at present there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of dpp-4i in patients with diabetes and covid-19 59glycemic control is important in any patient who has covid-19 though there is limited data about the association of blood glucose levels with disease course in covid-19 at present data from other infections like sars and influenza h1n1 has shown that patients with poor glycemic control have increased risk of complications and death 6061 most patients with mild infection and with normal oral intake can continue the usual antihyperglycemic medications however it is advisable to discontinue sglt-2 inhibitors because of the risk of dehydration and euglycemic ketosis metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake doses of other antihyperglycemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levelsmost hospitalised patient with covid-19 especially those with respiratory distress would require insulin ideally patients with very poor oral intake or those on mechanical ventilation would require intravenous insulin infusion with frequent monitoring of blood glucose every hour or every 2 h see next section however the adjustment of infusion rates would necessitate visit to the patient and increase exposure to the medical personnel there is a need to explore alternate insulin administration strategies one of these is use of subcutaneous short acting insulin analogues an approach which has been used successfully in mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis however its safety in critically ill patients is less clear 6263 secondly single dose of basal insulin has been attempted in critically ill patients as in one study from thailand this could be an attractive option as it would reduce contact with the patient considerably 64 but needs more research especially in critically sick patients finally insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion csii could be an option and some models have the advantage of altering the insulin rates remotely via bluetooth 65 fully automated closed-loop glucose control has been tried in critical illness and if feasible could be useful in treating patients with covid-19 66blood glucose monitoring poses a special challenge as it necessitates frequent visits to patients bedside especially if the patient is critically ill and receiving intravenous insulin however attempts could be made to minimize exposure if the patient is not critically ill heshe may be given a glucose testing device and self-monitoring may be taught blood glucose readings can then be communicated on phone and necessary action taken continuous glucose monitoring cgm could be of help especially the systems where the data can be remotely accessed without visiting the patient though there is some evidence of cgm interference with commonly prescribed medications like acetaminophen atenolol and lisinopril it has been shown to be useful and reliable in critically ill patients 6768treatment with ace inhibitors and arb has the potential to cause up regulation of ace-2 69 mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 70 a retrospective analysis showed reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ace inhibitors 71 however a contrary view is that increased expression of ace-2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with sars cov-2 this could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors however there is no evidence to support this hypothesis currently in a retrospective analysis of 112 covid-19 hospitalised patients with cardiovascular disease in wuhan there was no significant difference in the proportion of aceiarb medication between non-survivors and survivors 72 in view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm it is reasonable for patients to continue using ace inhibitors and arb as recommended by european society of cardiology council on hypertension european society of hypertension and american heart association 73 74 75there are several studies about the protective effect of statins in pneumonia 76 statins are known to increase ace-2 levels and may protect against viral entry of sars cov-2 77 however this increase in ace-2 could be counterintuitive in the current context nevertheless statins are known to inhibit nuclear factor kappa b nfb activation and might help in blunting the cytokine storm 78calcium channel blockers ccb have been shown to reduce severity of disease and mortality in patients with pneumonia presumably by inhibiting calcium influx into the cell 79 the precise role of these agents in covid-19 has not been studied however it seems safe to continue these drugs for control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients since ccb has no effect on ace2 expression some researchers have proposed its preferable use in patients with covid-19 and hypertension 80though aspirin has anti-inflammatory properties it may not be advisable to continue it in patients with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation however in patients with underlying coronary artery disease it needs to be continued as anticoagulant unless otherwise contraindicated
1patients with diabetes need to maintain regularity in daily diet care should be taken not to vary the calorie intake markedly healthy balanced diet with good amount of protein fiber and limitation of saturated fats is important to maintain a good glycemic control2exercise should be continued home based exercise like cycling treadmill stationary jogging and resistance exercise with small weights are beneficial3regular intake of antidiabetic drugs and insulin is important and should be emphasized4telemedicine can be very helpful in these times patients can consult their physician via telemedicine and appropriate advice about treatment can be given 81 an article dealing with telemedicine is under publication in the special issue5care of feet should be emphasized in order to avoid foot related complications there are telemedicine temperature mats which can screen for inflammation without having to visit the clinic the patients who show inflammation can then be called to the clinic 826patients need to be educated about the need to visit the hospital urgently in emergency situations like vomiting drowsiness shortness of breath chest pain weakness of limbs altered sensorium etc
diabetes is associated with increased incidence and severity of covid-19 there is experimental evidence of the effect of diabetes on viral entry into cell and inflammatory response to the infection it is important to control blood glucose in patients who are infected with covid-19 treating diabetes at present with restrictions on movement is challenging however innovations like telemedicine can be useful in these trying timeswe hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest related to this articlepneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 was first time reported on december 31 2019

 since then the covid19 pandemic disease caused by this virus had spread around the world until april 10 over 16 million confirmed cases in total and almost 100 000 deaths were identified worldwide everything started from wuhan hubei province in china more than 4 months ago and therefore practically all relevant clinical data are coming from china these findings are showing that arterial hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are common comorbidities in patients with covid19

 table 3 however findings are inconsistent and data are more epidemiological than analytical majority of studies did not analyze effect of many confounding factors such as age sex and obesity which could significantly change interaction between comorbidities and outcome it is clear that sudden outbreak of covid19 raised a great attention and forced rapid publication in order to explain epidemiology therapeutic approach and outcome many parameters were not available and inclusion of some risk factors such as obesity that would probably interfere with final results was not possible so far therefore one should be careful in interpretation of available data and indicating hypertension and diabetes as one of the most responsible risk factors at least not in global populationthe aim of this review was to summarize currently available data regarding the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid19 and its role in outcome in these patients hence a comprehensive systematic search was performed on pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar to find articles published until april 10 2020it is still unknown whether patients with diabetes have a higher susceptibility to covid19 but there is an observation that the risk is higher for both infection and disease severity however the percentage of patients with diabetes varies from 3 to 21
16
 
17
 in two largest metaanalyses that included 46 248 and 76 993 covid19 patients respectively diabetes was detected in 86 and 79
19
 
20
 however it should be noted that large level of heterogeneity exists between published studies that differ in sample size age of patients severity of covid19 hospital facilities investigated comorbidities therapeutic approach and finally outcomein one of the largest study published n  1099 so far diabetes was present in 74 of covid19 patients and it was significantly more prevalent in patients with severe form of disease and those who experienced primary outcome end point admission to an intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death
2
 the same group of authors in a larger group of covid19 patients n  1590 reported diabetes in 82 and it was significantly more prevalent among covid19 patients with severe form than in patients with nonsevere form of disease 346 vs 143
11
 the most recent study which included 1012 noncritically ill covid19 patients reported diabetes in only 3 of patients
17
 even though the prevalence of diabetes was low covid19 patients with aggravation of illness during followup were more frequently diabetic in comparison with those who did not have complication during covid19lian et al
3
 included 788 patients with covid19 and divided patients into two groups younger than 60 years and older than 60 years thereby contributing to explain why diabetes is related to susceptibility and severity of covid19 the authors showed that many comorbidities hypertension cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including diabetes were more prevalent in patients older than 60 years than in patients younger than 60 years
3
 difference in age is probably one of the main reasons for risk that is ascribed to diabetes in patients with covid19studies that investigated cardiac injury in covid19 patients defined by increased cardiospecific enzymes showed that diabetes was significantly more frequent among patients with cardiac injury than in patients without it
4
 
5
 nevertheless prevalence of hypertension cardiovascular diseases and chronic renal disease was significantly higher in patients who experienced cardiac injury and it would be difficult to separate the effect of diabetes from other underlying diseases moreover there was a large difference in age between covid19 patients with detected cardiac injury and those who did not have cardiac injury which also could contribute to worse outcome and cardiac injury
4
 
5
 the authors concluded that cardiac injury is common in covid19 patients 2028 and it is associated with significantly higher mortality in this population

guo et al
16
 investigated the effect of diabetes on the progression and prognosis of patients with covid19 in limited sample it was found that serum levels of inflammationrelated biomarkers such as il6 creactive protein serum ferritin and coagulation index and ddimer were significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared with those without
16
 which indicates that diabetic patients are predisposed to an hyperinflammatory state that ultimately leads to prompt deterioration of covid19 there was no significant difference in age between diabetics and nondiabetics but diabetics had more frequently cardiovascular disease than their nondiabetic counterparts
16
 however even when diabetic patients without other comorbidities were analyzed the results remained the sameinflammatory and procoagulant factors were significantly higher in diabetic patients among patients with diabetes 292 were on insulin therapy and increased the dose of insulin after admission whereas 375 were on oral antidiabetic therapy before admission and started insulin therapy after admission
16
 this means that patients had poor glycemic control during hospitalizationdiabetes is hyperinflammatory condition and seems that it may increase susceptibility for covid19 independently of other underlying diseases there are several possible mechanisms a inflammation b hypercoagulable state and c activation of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas and dysregulation of sympathetic nervous system there is evidence that sarscov the novel coronavirus responsible for covid19 uses ace2 on the surfaces of epithelial cells to bind and enter to infected cells
24
 ace2 is located in cardiac kidney lung and intestinal tissues and converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 which promotes vasodilation the function of raas in diabetic patients is already significantly modified
25
 and acute change in activity of ace2 may be the final trigger for hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable storm in covid19 however these are only hypotheses without reliable clinical evidence some observations from the covid19 pandemic indicated that raas inhibitors were more frequently taken by covid19 patients with unfavorable outcome
5
 these raised large concerns about use of raas inhibitors which are often prescribed to diabetic patients with or without concomitant hypertension another frequent comorbidity in covid19 patients recent findings from covid19 patients showed that raas inhibitors improve outcome in these patients
26
 and confirmed recent position statements from several societies who strongly recommended continuation of regular treatment with raas inhibitorsdata regarding influence of diabetes on outcome in diabetic patients are still limited table 3 guo et al
5
 in the large study of covid19 patients showed that diabetes was not a prevalent comorbidity in total population 74 but it was significantly more prevalent in patients who experienced the primary composite end point intensive care admission mechanical ventilation and death than in patients who did not have these complications 269 vs 61 nevertheless only 67 out of 1099 patients experienced primary end point and it should be cautious in interpretation of these resultsother studies that investigated outcome were significantly smaller and results about impact of diabetes are different in most of the studies exists the trend toward higher prevalence of diabetes among nonsurvivors but in majority of studies it did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size
6
 
7
 
13
 
18
 table 3 zhou et al
8
 reported significantly higher prevalence of diabetes among nonsurvivors and they proved that diabetes was associated with mortality from covid19 but after adjustment for age and smoking status this predictive value vanished the same was reported for other comorbidities such as hypertension coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
8
 which raised the question about actual importance of diabetes and emphasized the unfavorable significance of patients age the same study showed that proinflammatory biomarkers were not independent predictors of mortality whereas ddimer 1 gml was the only independent predictor from coagulable parameters these findings are challenging the hypothesis that hyperinflammation state in diabetic patients may be responsible for mortality of these patients in covid19 nevertheless the number of patients in this study is very limited n  51 and drawing conclusion is not an easy taskwu et al

 compared covid19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and found that diabetes was a significant predictor of ards hr 234 95 ci 135405 but not of mortality hr 158 95 ci 080313 it should be underlined that multivariate analysis with adjustment for age sex and other possible confounding factors was not performed due to small sample size n  84in metaanalysis that included 1558 patients with covid19 it was found that diabetes as well as hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with exacerbation and admission to intensive care unit
23

in the only study that aimed to investigate the effect of diabetes on progression and prognosis of patients with covid19 was reported significantly higher mortality among diabetic patients without other comorbidities 167 vs 0
16
 however diabetic patients were almost twice as old as nondiabetics 61 vs 32 years which must be taken into consideration the majority of inflammatory parameters creactive protein serum ferritin erythrocyte sedimentation rate and interleukin6 and procoagulant factors ddimer and fibrinogen were also significantly higher among diabetic patients without other comorbidities
16
 diabetic complications were more prevalent in patients who died with borderline statistical significance interestingly ketoacidosis and infectious shock conditions that would be assumed to be the most responsible for these findings were not more prevalent among covid19 patients with lethal outcome
16
 initiation of insulin after admission which speaks in favor of poor glycemic regulation was also not related to higher mortality however only 37 diabetic patients were included in this study and only 24 of them did not have other comorbidities which is why this study may provide only directions for some future studies but not conclusions coronary artery disease particularly asymptomatic form which is frequently present in diabetic patients could not be excluded as potential confounding factor which is additional limitationthere are still many uncertainties whether diabetes interferes with sarscov2 and facilities the entrance of coronavirus in epithelial cells as well as development of severe complications resulting in lethal outcome it is reasonable to hypothesize that preexisting diabetesinduced target organ damage can be responsible for higher susceptibility of diabetic patients to this virus furthermore diabetic patients with increased inflammatory factors and hypercoagulability are more likely to progress into a worse prognosis therefore patients with diabetes deserve more intensive attention and should be closely monitored due to the risk of rapid deterioration in order to prevent infection and possible complications diabetic patients together with hypertensive patients and particularly those with both comorbidities should have advantage once the vaccine is availablethere are a number of limitations in available data the selfreporting of comorbidities on hospital admission which was used in most of investigation can cause significant underreporting of comorbidities due to the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing which could further interfere with the relationship between comorbidities and clinical outcome furthermore followup was short and some patients remained in the hospital when data were analyzed meaning that actual outcome is unknown which directly influenced published results obesity was not reported in any of these studies and influence of bmi could not be investigated or included in adjustment which would be of a great importance in diabetic patient data about antidiabetic therapy at baseline and during treatment are poor and the prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes is unknown both parameters are potential confounding factors in evaluation of diabetes as independent predictor of susceptibility to virus or outcome of disease the majority of studies involved only limited number of patients which can be an important limitation for reaching statistical power the last but not the least important is the fact that all data are coming from china and one should be careful when extrapolating these findings to other countries with current outbreak of covid19 because the prevalence of comorbidities varies significantly among countriesthe influence of diabetes on severity and outcome in covid19 patients is not clear because of large gap in evidence it is not known which antidiabetic therapy was used in diabetic patients how many patients were untreated and how many had uncontrolled diabetes obesity as one of the most important comorbidities in diabetic patients has not been investigated at all large studies with comprehensive analysis of all risk factors and longer followup are necessary to answer all questions that have been raised and we should not be surprised if upcoming results from western countries that are currently affected by covid19 will be different from currently available data nevertheless patients with diabetes and hypertension particularly in advanced age should have priority once the vaccine becomes availableno conflict of intereston 31 december 2019 the who office in china was informed of a few cases of pneumonia of unknown cause originating from the city of wuhan hubei in china1 over the next 3 months the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 illness commonly called covid-19 has affected more than four million people globally with over 14 million cases in the usa itself making it the new epicentre of the illness followed by much of western europe the mortality rates from different parts of the world show vast differences but studies have consistently shown that the presence of comorbidities specially type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly increases mortality in patients with sars-cov-2 with an or of 28525 a study from china also showed that patients in the intensive care unit with sars-cov-2 infection were more likely to have underlying diabetes 222 vs 59 than others6 certain forms of hypophysitis thyroiditis and adrenalitis have viral aetiologies changes in endocrine functions observed during the previous coronavirus outbreak with sars-cov led to considerable morbidity and were important predictors of mortality therefore it is imperative to know the endocrinopathic impact of sars-cov-2 illness the purpose of this review is to highlight the available data on endocrine changes in such patients and to recapitulate the existing knowledge from previous coronavirus outbreaks for better risk stratification and management of patients with sars-cov-2 infectionall articles reporting endocrine changes in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients were considered electronic database of pubmed was searched using medical subject headings mesh terms related to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and different hormones since the sars-cov outbreak occurred in 2002 search results were limited to january 2002 onwards to consider articles pertaining to the outbreaks of both the viruses a considerable number of articles were in the chinese language and were included after being translated into english this was supplemented by handsearching reference lists for additional studies and case reports similarly google scholar database was handsearched studies listing type 2 diabetes mellitus as a risk factor of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were excluded since they did not mention any biochemical changes articles about corticosteroid induced hyperglycaemia audio interviews and articles detailing the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system raas inhibitors were excluded an initial search showed 1585 articles finally 17 of them were included figure 1a detailed histopathological study on the effects of sars infection on the thyroid gland was done during the sars-cov outbreak7 there was extensive injury of the parafollicular cells and follicular epithelium with the destruction and exfoliation of epithelial cells into the follicle leading to its disruption these changes were responsible for lower levels of thyroid hormones noted in clinical studies parafollicular cells are responsible for calcitonin production and they could not be identified on he sections in the tissue sample from patients with sars damage to interfollicular tissue including parafollicular cells may adversely affect calcitonin production an interesting finding was the absence of inflammatory infiltrate and features of cellular necrosis supporting the hypothesis of extensive apoptosis responsible for thyroid injurythe pathology data of the thyroid gland in patients with sars-cov-2 infection have been published by yao et al they conducted minimally invasive autopsies from different organs in patients who had died of sars-cov-2 and investigated the pathological changes8 they reported no abnormalities in the thyroid follicular morphology but did note lymphocytic infiltration in the interstitium none of the tissue immunohistochemistry and pcr analyses detected sars-cov-2 in the thyroid gland these findings are at variance with those reported in sars-cov though the patient characteristics in the two studies were nearly the same however irrespective of pathological findings most of the studies found a similar pattern of biochemical changeslimited data suggest that the thyroid gland and the hypothalamopituitarythyroid hpt axis are directly affected in sars-cov-2 illness a study of 274 patients with sars-cov-2 showed that thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and free triiodothyronine t3 concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients 07 miuml and 28 pmoll than in recovered patients 14 miuml and 43 pmoll the difference in the thyroxine t4 levels was not statistically significant9
a study by wang et al reported that serum levels of t3 and t4 in patients with sars-cov were significantly lower than those in the control group and low t3 levels correlated with disease severity serum t3 and t4 levels were decreased respectively in 94 and 46 of 48 patients with sars-cov during the acute phase and 90 and 38 during the convalescent phase of the disease10 the authors also noted lower levels of tsh in these patients dysfunction of the hpt axis caused a diminished level of serum tsh in patients with sars-cov despite low serum t3 and t4 no significant difference in serum parathyroid hormone level was observed between patients with sars-cov and the control group during the acute or convalescent phases of the illnesschanges in thyroid hormone levels may persist after clinical recovery leow et al studied sars-cov survivors for hormonal derangements 3 months after recovery and noted that 67 of the patients had developed biochemical hypothyroidism11 the majority of these patients 75 had a central aetiology and only 25 developed primary hypothyroidism with positive antibodies and continued to receive thyroid hormone replacement at the end of the study on follow-up changes in the thyroid profile of the patients with central hypothyroidism had normalised central hypocortisolism was also present in 66 of patients who had central hypothyroidism the authors suggested a dysfunctional hpt axis as evidenced by the results of thyroid hormones and the coexistence of central hypocortisolismthese studies suggest for the monitoring of thyroid function tests during acute illness as well as during convalescence of sars-cov-2 with the possibility of replacement therapy as indicated there were reports of recovery of thyroid function in 3 6 months in sars-cov patients implying reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic11
many viruses such as enteroviruses coxsackie b virus12 retroviruses rubella mumps cytomegalovirus epstein-barr and varicella zoster virus have been implicated in the development of diabetes mellitus in humans13
coronavirus has also been reported to cause diabetes in animal and human studies in a case report of a foal it was suggested that the pancreas could have had direct viral damage due to coronavirus leading to diarrhoea and transient diabetes mellitus simultaneously14
it has been demonstrated that coronaviruses enter human lungs pancreas and other tissues by interacting with the ace2 receptor the expression of ace2 is much stronger in pancreatic endocrine tissue compared with the exocrine tissue15 the extent of tissue damage by sars-cov is a direct function of the level of expression of tissue ace2 thus sars-cov viruses may damage pancreatic islets and cause acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus but not acute pancreatitisthe pancreatic biopsy findings in sars-cov-2 patients have been identical to the previous studies in sars-cov patients yao et al reported no obvious abnormalities in the epithelial cells in the exocrine pancreas however degeneration of a few islet cells was noted8
it was observed that patients with mild sars-cov who did not receive glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of fasting plasma glucose fpg on the first day of hospitalisation than those who had non-sars pneumonia new-onset diabetes developed in 51 of sars-cov patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment during illness15 hyperglycaemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in sars-cov patients with and without a history of diabetes mellitus4 yang et al demonstrated that before steroid treatment the mean fpg level was significantly higher in sars-cov patients deceased vs survivors vs non-sars pneumonia group 9752 vs 6530 vs 5110 mmoll p001 hyperglycaemia fpg70 mmoll before steroid treatment was significantly associated with death or 33 after adjustment for age and gender there was an incremental rise in mortality with increasing fpg another interesting association noted was between hypoxaemia and higher fpg levels4 among patients with no known history of diabetes and before the commencement of steroid therapy those who had hypoxaemia arterial oxygen saturation 93 had higher fpg levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor 8749 vs 6321 mmoll and deceased 9848 vs 7215 mmoll groups it was estimated that for every 10 mmoll increase in fpg the hr increased by 108-fold for death and 107-fold for hypoxia morbidity in both survivors and deceased patients irrespective of steroid dosage elevated fpg values started falling in the third week indicating gradual recovery of islet cell functionabout half a billion people are currently living with diabetes worldwide patients with diabetes had a poorer outcome in previous epidemics of sars-cov and h1n1 epidemics16 17 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes and without other comorbidities was recently reported by guo et al from wuhan china18 patients with diabetes may present with milder symptoms initially but they were at higher risk of rapid progression to severe pneumonia uncontrolled cytokine storm and hypercoagulable state contributing to a poorer prognosis interleukin-6 il-6 level was found to be higher in sars-cov-2 cases with diabetes than those without diabetes wang et al hypothesised that sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes might trigger stress condition and increase secretion of hyperglycaemic hormones such as glucocorticoid and catecholamines resulting in elevated blood glucose abnormal glucose variability and diabetic complications in turn leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates in these patients19
a study of 99 sars-cov-2 patients demonstrated that 52 of patients had elevated blood glucose with a mean glucose value of 74 mmoll20 wu et al
21 showed that sars-cov-2 patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards had higher glucose levels 74 vs 54 mmoll compared with patients who did not develop ards hr 113 similarly in sars-cov-2 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms increased glucose level was an independent risk factor for severecritical illness on multivariate analysis or 24222 sars-cov-2 patients with diabetes are at high risk of progressing rapidly with ards and septic shock ma et al recommended fpg of 4461 mmoll 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose 2 h pg 6178 mmoll in mild cases and fpg 78100 mmoll 2 h pg 78139 mmoll for critically ill patients of sars-cov-223
to sum up sars-cov infections damage islet cells causing acute temporary diabetes high fpg and associated metabolic changes lead to increased morbidity and mortality in these patients in addition pre-existing diabetes may be considered a risk factor for poorer outcomes of sars-cov-2 pneumonia intensive blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy to obtain optimal metabolic control may improve the outcome of these patients tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 may have a role in patients with diabetes to control overexpressed il-6 it is being used off-label currently and a randomised controlled trial is testing its utility24 the european society of endocrinology statement advises patients with diabetes to avoid physician office visits and seek telephonicelectronic consultations for optimal control of blood sugar they need to get an early referral to emergency services in case of possible symptoms of sars-cov-225
the histological changes in adrenal glands of the patients dying from sars-cov were described by ding et al from postmortem biopsy samples26 they noted that the adrenal medulla had been infiltrated by mainly the monocytes and lymphocytes another interesting finding was the focal necrosis of the gland in addition vasculitis of the small veins of the adrenal medulla was present no similar studies have been conducted in sars-cov-2 patients until date however there are reasons to believe that similar adrenal gland changes could occur given the similarity of the viral structure and mechanism of entry into human host cellssars-cov genome sequences have been detected in the cytoplasm of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex27 it might induce either hypophysitis or directly affect the hypothalamus leading to hypothalamicpituitary dysfunction leow et al
11 studied hypocortisolism in patients who had recovered from sars-cov patients with an intact hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis at the time of acquiring sars-cov were included in the study these patients also had symptoms like lethargy malaise lassitude fatigue weakness orthostatic dizziness anorexia apathy anxiety and depression after recovery three months after recovery 393 of patients had hypocortisolism of which 833 had central hypocortisolism as depicted by low adrenocorticotropic hormone acth levels it was interesting to note that the majority of these patients had not received any systemic glucocorticoids as part of the treatment for sars ruling out the possibility of hpa axis suppression by exogenous corticosteroid use the hypocortisolism was however transient and resolved in 625 of patients within a year with an average duration of 5931 months these patients also reported resolution of symptoms including orthostatic hypotension in comparison to the start of the study six patients 25 continued with residual hypocortisolism at 1-year follow-up and one of them still required hydrocortisone replacement a quarter of the patients also revealed transient biochemical thyroid changes with some patients developing both a central hypothyroid and hypoadrenal state with the hpa axis affected more frequently than the hpt axis the authors also found low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate dheas in 131 patients after adjusting for age sex and menopausal status dheas replacement could further ameliorate symptoms in those with dheas deficiencyfindings from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients suggest for actively monitoring biochemical changes like serum cortisol and acth shall these biochemical changes go unnoticed it may complicate post-sars recovery symptomatic patients with orthostatic hypotension may require physiological doses of hydrocortisone replacement until hpa axis recovery in addition patients with adrenal insufficiency and cushings syndrome are at increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and should adhere to enhanced preventive stepschanges in the cells of anterior pituitary were noted in biopsy samples of sars-cov patients28 on immunohistochemical staining the number of somatotrophs thyrotrophs and corticotrophs was reduced while the number of lactotrophs and gonadotrophs was significantly increased these findings correlated with biochemical abnormalities of increased prolactin luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in sars-cov reported earlier in chinese literatureseasonal and the h1n1 influenza a virus h1n1 pandemic have been associated with increased severity and greater risk of morbidity and mortality in obese persons compared with normal weight persons being overweight and obesity both negatively impact cellular immune response to h1n1 influenza29 obesity is associated with several chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus obstructive sleep apnoea and surfactant dysfunction in the lungs which may increase the risk of complications of sars-cov-2 the intensive care management of patients with severe obesity is always very challenging and difficult30 it is likely that obesity is an independent risk factor for severe sars-cov-2 illness and should be further investigatedearly studies have linked the increased mortality rates in sars-cov-2 patients with the presence of diabetes mellitus increased glucose levels have been associated with the development of ards and worsening of sars-cov-2 illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation hyperglycaemia can be a useful predictor to assess patients and triage them effectively to provide early management strategies strict glucose management is required in such patients to reduce mortality central hypothyroidism and central hypocortisolism seem to occur commonly in patients infected with coronavirus these changes are usually transient and occur during the illness or after recovery this crucial information calls for reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic and identifying these changes early with prompt management can prevent further complications prospective randomised clinical trials cohort studies and pathology studies of sars-cov-2 patients are ongoing and may further elucidate the mechanisms of these endocrinopathies translating into better treatment of patients affected by this virustoday the coronavirus 2019-ncov pandemic is considered a great threat to the global health and numerous deaths are attributed to this deadly virus all across the world during the last months morbidity and mortality have been reported all across the world during the last two months 1 as documented in details elsewhere everybody is susceptible to this newly-emerged coronavirus but people with underlying conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are more apt to develop serious and life-threatening complications 2 although people with osteoporosis and those taking osteoporosis medications are neither at a greater risk for contracting the disease nor more susceptible to develop serious complications prevention from osteoporotic fractures in the present situation is of utmost importance 3 however seeking medical attentions including treatment and monitoring services by osteoporotic patients makes them at a higher risk for the infection as a matter of fact in todays resource-constrained health systems both in developing and developed world placing extra burden on health systems is quite irresponsible moreover patients with osteoporosis and diabetes can exponentially increase their risk of contracting the disease by exposing themselves to hospitals and other healthcare facilities this can be potentially remedied through promoting usage of digital health technology and patients with osteoporosis and diabetes should be encouraged to use telehealth services as far as they can and avoid exposing themselves to the high-risk clinical environments 4iran is unfortunately among the countries with the higher numbers of both contracted and diseased corona virus cases both in the globe and the middle east 5 endocrinology and metabolism research institute emri of tehran university of medical sciences tums has been assigned as a world health organization who collaborating centre for research and education on management of diabetes and osteoporosis since 2007 and this collaboration continued until 2019 6 in such capacity emri regularly designs and carries out different national and international events with the objective of promoting the knowledge and skills of iranian clinicians and scientists about latest advances in the field of endocrinology and metabolic diseases many of these educational events and sessions are designed and implemented under direct supervision of globally-renowned organizations such as who world health organization and iof international osteoporosis federationduring the past few months in collaboration with other domestic and international organizations concerned scientist at the emri have been meticulously following the covid-19 pandemic developments as they unfold with the main objective of delivering the best possible prevention and management service to people with diabetes and osteoporosis these activities include design and publication of treatment protocols as well as professional and public educational materials books booklets videos in persian language all published materials are freely accessible to all iranian and persian-speaking patients and clinicians all across the worldin the early beginnings of the outbreak emri published a booklet entitled diabetes management during the sick days which aimed at easing psychological burden imposed on patients with diabetes and their caregivers this publication is freely available on the official website of the institute moreover simultaneously an educational video clip in persian language entitled diabetes management in coronavirus was produced and published on emri websiteinitially with the view of development a robust infrastructure iranian diabetes academy ida 7 was formed as a platform for production and dissemination of valid and credible information about diabetes and its complications for both healthcare providers and patient through e-learning technology addressing the current epidemics an instruction pamphlet for patients with diabetes and their caregivers entitled covid-19 outbreak guidance for people with diabetes was published moreover based on the information provided by the international diabetes federation idf a booklet entitled professional guideline for management of patients with diabetes during the coronavirus pandemic was adapted for the use of iranian health care providers and made accessible for all interested individuals and organizations it is noteworthy moreover that there are several cme modules in persian about diabetes management on the ida website which can be of immense benefit to health care providers all interested individuals can freely access these online modules and promote their knowledge and skills about diabetes management during the current pandemicsimilarly international osteoporosis foundation iof has published a set of general recommendations for people with osteoporosis entitled covid-19 and osteoporosis to encourage patients to continue taking medications and avoid fracture risks also iof has produced and informative material entitled delays to medication which aims to inform patients about continuation or modification of the medicine they currently use likewise the other material of iof about vitamin d and coronavirus was translated to provide applied information about taking vitamin d supplements and sunlight during stay home all aforementioned materials were translated in persian and uploaded on the official website of the emri and this invaluable information is all accessible free of charge moreover emri is working to develop an online course for education of health care professionals on the management of osteoporosis during the pandemic periodconcerning to the who global strategy on digital health the success of the digital transformation of the health-care sector requires all stakeholders to think of new ways to contribute to conquering national and global health goalsless than six months ago noone had heard of covid19 and few people knew what a coronavirus was yet today it is on everyones lips on 11 march 2020 the who declared the outbreak a global pandemic and the disease has spread to multiple countries across the globe covid19 is characterized by a fever dry cough fatigue and shortness of breath and for the majority the symptoms will be minor however for a few the illness can progress to pneumonia and multiorgan failure while data are emerging it seems that the mortality rate is of the order of 12 1 so what does the epidemic mean for people with diabetes

caption covid19 coronavirus particles coloured transmission electron micrograph tem also called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 this virus causes the disease covid19 this sample was isolated from a patient in the usa sarscov2 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 it is an enveloped rna ribonucleic acid virus the coronaviruses take their name from their crown corona of surface proteins which are used to attach and penetrate their host cells as of midmarch 2020 over 230000 people have been infected with over 9500 deaths
people with diabetes have a higher overall risk of infection that results from multiple perturbations of innate immunity while humoral immunity appears relatively unaffected people with diabetes have impaired phagocytosis by neutrophils macrophages and monocytes impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and bactericidal activity and impaired innate cellmediated immunity as overall mortality related to cardiovascular disease continues to decline among people with diabetes pneumonia has become an increasingly important cause of death in diabetes with different contributing pathogens 2whether people with diabetes have a higher susceptibility to covid19 is currently unknown but there is a perception that the risk is higher both of infection and severe disease for example the first three deaths related to covid19 in hong kong all occurred in people with diabetes in a large series 173 cases of 1099 laboratoryconfirmed covid19 cases 16 in china were classified as severe 3 sixteen percent of those with severe disease had diabetes in contrast only 57 of the remaining 926 cases with mild disease had diabetes likewise 24 of those with severe disease had hypertension compared to 13 among those with mild disease highlighting the increased risk of adverse outcomes among those with chronic diseases like diabetesit is currently unknown why people with diabetes hypertension or other chronic diseases are more severely affected by covid19 but one possible explanation involves angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is present in cardiac kidney lung and intestinal tissue and by converting angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 it counteracts the effects of angiotensin ii and promotes vasodilation in a similar manner to the coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscov the novel coronavirus responsible for covid19 utilizes ace2 on the surfaces of epithelial cells to bind and gain entry to infected cells 4 5 diabetes and conditions such as hypertension are associated with activation of the reninangiotensin system in different tissues furthermore people with diabetes and hypertension are often treated with ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs which can lead to increased expression of ace2 thereby facilitating viral uptake and increasing the risk of severe infection for people with diabetes 6 whilst these observations have led to suggestions that switching people on reninangiotensin system blockers to other agents may modify disease risk 6 this would be premature and unwarranted in the absence of any experimental evidence to support this approach on the contrary treatment with arbs has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for covid19 7 supported by observations that blocking the reninangiotensin system in animal models attenuated the lung injury caused by the sarscov which also utilizes ace2 8 a recent position statement from the european society of cardiology also strongly recommends that physicians and patients continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive treatment and that there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ace inhibitors or arbs should be discontinued because of the covid19 infection 9direct infection however is not the only issue for people with diabetes the infection and outbreak has challenged the delivery of healthcare in many ways healthcare professionals in hospitals may be redeployed to caring for the increasing caseloads of people admitted with fever and suspected disease and the workforce may be further diminished as healthcare providers become affected by the disease clinic visits may be postponed and treatment for diabetesrelated issues may be delayed there may be an unwillingness of people with diabetes to expose themselves to potential infection and so they may avoid attendance at hospitals clinics and retinal screening although this may be overcome to a certain extent by utilising phone or video consultations or other forms of communication as healthcare delivery becomes increasingly interrupted and fragmented access to basic medical supplies such as insulin may become increasingly difficult somewhat akin to the challenges faced in other natural disasters panic buying has already made it harder for people with diabetes to obtain alcohol wipes or gel to perform hygiene before injection or glucose monitoring in some regionslack of access to medications and supplies has also been experienced by people who need to undergo quarantine colleagues in hong kong for example were contacted by people quarantined on a cruise ship who had run out of medications including insulin due to unexpected delays to their travels and difficulty in gaining access to medications another contagion that has occurred as a result of covid19 is fear and the resulting anxiety and sleep disturbances may adversely affect glucose controlsome important lessons have been learned with regard to controlling the epidemic and should be shared and highlighted back in march 2003 almost exactly 17 years ago several asian countries and subsequently other countries were hit by the sars outbreak caused by the sars coronavirus 10 since then many measures have been implemented in the region to prevent similar outbreaks of infectious diseases for example in hong kong these measures include increasing distances between inpatient beds and provision of negativepressure ventilation rooms and isolation wards in all major public hospitals there are defined protocols for protection against aerosolgenerating procedures as well as a public health response alert system perhaps most important of all however is the response and attitude of the general public having experienced the threat of a major infectious disease outbreak the population as a whole has developed a high degree of awareness tenacity and preparedness in doing their part to help avoid transmissionin hong kong people have accepted the need for frequent handwashing environmental hygiene and wearing surgical masks regardless of whether one has respiratory symptoms or not there is tolerance towards social isolation and avoiding unnecessary gatherings during the outbreak these socialdistancing measures coupled with government policies towards restricting travel limiting transmission in largescale institutions such as universities and schools rigorous contact tracing early testing diagnosis isolation and treatment appear to be having some effect in controlling the spread in some asian countries and flattening the epidemic curve 11 as an increasing number of countries find themselves battling a rapid rise in cases the lessons learned should serve to inform and guide the public health response to this alarming pandemic these lessons are only now being learned in europelastly another casualty of the covid19 epidemic was this years diabetic medicine symposium 12 in line with many other medical organizations diabetes uk took the decision to cancel this years professional conference in a bid to limit spread of the virus although people cannot hear the lectures the accompanying review articles are still available in the journal 13 14 15bariatric surgery has been used for decades to treat patients with severe obesity in 2016 global guidelines established through the diabetes surgery summit dss an international consensus conference series formally recognised gastrointestinal surgery as a standard therapy for type 2 diabetes this practice is known as metabolic surgery1 during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak under unprecedented pressure to free up inpatient capacity and because of intraoperative risks for viral contagion among patients and staff hospitals worldwide have been obliged to postpone most elective operations including bariatric and metabolic surgery increased hazards of severe covid-19 complications in patients with obesity type 2 diabetes or both2 3 4 5 further support the rationale for a pause in elective surgery during the peak of the pandemicthe return to normal services will be gradual with surgeons competing for reduced capacity to address a backlog of elective procedures hence access to bariatric and metabolic surgery will continue to be constrained given the uncertainty regarding the effects and duration of the covid-19 outbreak combined with the progressive nature of obesity diabetes and related conditions delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery could increase the risks for morbidity and mortality in surgical candidates the risk of harm however is variable among individuals depending on the type and severity of disease and their indications for bariatric and metabolic surgery the traditional weight-centric criteria for patient selection in bariatric surgery which are still commonly used today do not reflect severity of disease6 and they therefore cannot be used to prioritise treatment based on actual clinical needs furthermore physical distancing policies and continued lockdowns might limit adherence to lifestyle interventions worsening metabolic deterioration among candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery additionally reduced access to non-urgent care during the covid-19 pandemic might impede postoperative monitoring for potential surgical and nutritional complicationsa clear and urgent need therefore exists for strategies to mitigate harm to patients during and after the covid-19 pandemic these approaches should include non-surgical interventions to optimise metabolic and weight control in patients awaiting surgery telemedicine protocols for postoperative surveillance and use of appropriate criteria to triage surgical candidates during a foreseeable period of reduced capacity for elective surgery to address these issues the dss1 organisers directed a group of international experts to assess the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on candidates for surgical treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes our specific aim was to develop criteria to help prioritise bariatric and metabolic surgery for when elective surgery is resumed and beyondsurgery ameliorates a wide range of conditions and diseases both acute and chronic emergency surgery is required when acute problems pose immediate threat to life organs or limbs and must be done without delay elective surgery refers to operations that can be planned and scheduled in advance these procedures however are not optional because they can have important life-changing implications when access to elective surgery is reduced doctors should prioritise patients with the greatest need or with a greater risk of harm from delayed treatment in some health-care systems elective surgery is categorised into urgent semi-urgent or non-urgent7 8 urgent elective surgery is required within 30 days for conditions that might deteriorate quickly semi-urgent conditions are those that although not likely to deteriorate quickly could reasonably cause severe pain or dysfunction or further harm if delayed beyond 3 months non-urgent elective surgery is planned for conditions that are unlikely to cause substantial discomfort dysfunction or harm if treated within 1 yearalthough some complications from bariatric and metabolic operations can require emergency surgical treatment eg haemorrhage leak or intestinal obstruction most bariatric and metabolic procedures represent genuine elective surgery to date however no consensus exists for criteria to identify urgent semi-urgent or non-urgent indications in bariatric and metabolic surgery on the basis of the type and severity of patients conditionslaparoscopic surgery involves aerosol-generating techniques such as carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum electrocautery and ultrasonic shearing these techniques could easily increase the risk of viral contagion for staff9 10 including with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 upper gastrointestinal endoscopy another aerosol-producing procedure is also commonly done before bariatric and metabolic surgery patients undergoing major surgery are at risk of life-threatening inflammatory complications such as infection including from viruses the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis11
although there is no conclusive evidence that laparoscopy or upper endoscopy can promote covid-19 transmission postponing elective metabolic and bariatric interventions during the acute phase of the covid-19 outbreak seems sensible except for urgent revisional surgery or emergency endoscopic interventions for complications eg haemorrhage stoma stenosis or leaksdespite the potential for a higher risk of contagion the laparoscopic approach in bariatric and metabolic surgery is associated with substantial benefits compared with traditional open surgery especially in patients with severe obesity these benefits include lower rates of mortality and complications including pulmonary and procedural and shorter hospital stays12 13 for these reasons laparoscopic access should remain the preferred approach over open techniques when elective bariatric and metabolic surgery resumes appropriate personal protective equipment should be used however given the increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection for staffobesity increases the risk of complications from viral respiratory infections during the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic in california 91 of people who died had obesity and higher bmi was associated with mortality14 in patients admitted to intensive care for sars-cov-2 class 23 obesity bmi 35 kgm2 is an independent risk factor for disease severity5 similarly patients with diabetes have augmented risk for severe covid-19 and mortality2 3 4 5
several mechanisms have been suggested to increase the risk of complications from viral infections in obesity and type 2 diabetes including low-grade chronic inflammation with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines reduced natural killer cell number and activity and impaired antigen-stimulation responses15 16 17 another factor that might have a role in the relationship between obesity diabetes and increased risk for complications is that sars-cov-2 enters host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 ace2 receptor ace2 transforms angiotensin 2 to angiotensin14 15 16 17 18 19 20 thereby reducing vasoconstriction sodium retention inflammation and metabolic degeneration21 chronic hyperglycaemia downregulates ace2 expression22 and further reduction of ace2 during covid-19 infection could contribute to hyperinflammation and respiratory failure in patients with type 2 diabetes23 people with obesity are also prone to hypoventilation syndrome cardiovascular disease24 heart failure25 and other conditions that could increase the risk of covid-19 mortalitywhen elective bariatric and metabolic surgery resumes the pandemic will be contained but sars-cov-2 will probably still circulate in the population given the risks of severe complications from covid-19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes we recommend that covid-19 screening should be mandatory preoperatively for patients considering bariatric and metabolic surgerydiabetes is a major cause of morbidity and death including from cardiovascular renal neurological and retinal complications approximately two-thirds of people with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease with a relative risk 1826 times greater than in people without diabetes26 the biological progression of type 2 diabetes characterised by declining -cell function and continuing insulin resistance is manifested clinically by deteriorations in multiple parameters including hba1c fasting and postprandial glucose levels the uk prospective diabetes study27 reported significant associations between hyperglycaemia and development of diabetes complications or death and a 21 risk reduction for any diabetes-related endpoint with each 1 absolute hba1c reductionfactors beyond hyperglycaemia can also influence type 2 diabetes prognosis in the triad study28 29 predictors of all-cause mortality at 4 years and 8 years of study follow-up included older age male sex non-hispanic white race lower education and income longer duration of diabetes lower bmi hypertension macrovascular disease retinopathy nephropathy and neuropathy among the specific predictors of cardiovascular mortality were also treatment with insulin with or without oral medication higher ldl cholesterol history of nephropathy transient ischaemic attack stroke angina myocardial infarction coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease and use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering medicationsobesity increases the risks of many other illnesses including diabetes hypertension dyslipidaemia liver disease coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease many cancers cholelithiasis infertility psychosocial dysfunction osteoarthritis chronic kidney disease and now also covid-19 together these complications powerfully reduce quality of life and exacerbate obesity-associated mortality even before covid-19 obesity reduced life expectancy by 520 years30 notably higher all-cause mortality is associated with obesity class 2 bmi 35399 kgm2 and 3 bmi 40 kgm2 corresponding to candidates for bariatric surgery but not with class 1 obesity bmi 30349 kgm231
obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obesity-associated heart failure substantially increase mortality obesity hypoventilation syndrome represents the combination of obesity and chronic daytime hypercapnia32 33 the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is highest among patients with a bmi of more than 50 kgm234 mortality from untreated obesity hypoventilation syndrome can be as high as 24 at 152 years after diagnosis35 obesity heart failure is associated with increased mortality and for each 5-unit increase in bmi heart failure-related mortality increases by 14 times36
since bmi alone does not reflect obesity-related mortality and morbidity staging systems such as the kings obesity criteria37 and edmonton obesity staging system eoss38 have been developed to assess individual patients risk on the basis of evidence of subclinical established or end-stage comorbidities39 retrospective application of eoss to data from the national health and nutrition examination survey showed that patients in stages 24 of eoss have increased all-cause mortality compared with stages 0 or 1 this finding supports the idea that the presence type and severity of obesity-related complications in addition to bmi39 should inform decision making about the prioritisation of treatment especially surgerynon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterised by excess hepatic fat its more aggressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis includes hepatocyte injury inflammation and fibrosis40 41 42 these two conditions affect 2025 of the western population with rates rising worldwide40 43 66 of patients with obesity and diabetes have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis44 45
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can lead to cirrhosis in 1520 of cases liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma46 beyond liver-related mortality non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can substantially increase microvascular and macrovascular complications and cardiovascular mortality in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes40 41 42 43 47 48 non-randomised trials suggest that roux-en-y gastric bypass resolves the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in up to 80 of patients49 50
randomised clinical trials and observational studies show that in patients with all classes of obesity bariatric and metabolic surgery promotes greater long-term weight loss than the best available non-surgical interventions regardless of the operation chosen47 51 52 53 multiple observational studies also indicate that bariatric and metabolic surgery lowers long-term risk of all-cause mortality compared with matched non-surgical patients54 55 56 57 58 59 data from eight observational studies involving a total of 635 642 patients suggest that bariatric and metabolic surgery is associated with a reduced risk of all types of cancer odds ratio or072 95 ci 059087 and obesity-associated cancer or055 95 ci 03109660 61 62 without exception each of the 29 all-cause mortality studies published to date shows that patients who have bariatric and metabolic surgery live longer than matched non-surgical controls54 55 56 57 58 59 63 64
concerning type 2 diabetes at least 12 randomised controlled trials comparing bariatric and metabolic surgery with conventional diabetes therapies ie lifestyle plus medication in patients with type 2 diabetes show that surgery is superior for control of hyperglycaemia reduction of cardiovascular and overall mortality risk improvement in quality of life and reduction in risk of renal complications1 65 66 the safety of bariatric and metabolic surgery compares favourably with that of most elective operations including hysterectomy cholecystectomy and knee replacement surgical treatments for diabetes are highly cost-effective with the cost per quality-adjusted life-year ranging between us3200 and 13 0001 65 67
based on this evidence dss guidelines which have been formally endorsed by 56 worldwide medical or scientific organisations and recognised by payers worldwide recommend the consideration of bariatric and metabolic surgery for appropriate candidates including those with only class 1 obesity who do not achieve adequate glycaemic control with medical therapy1
the delay of bariatric and metabolic surgery that is occurring due to covid-19 will augment the burden of disease among surgical candidates this increase will particularly affect patients with type 2 diabetes given that metabolic surgery causes remission of hyperglycaemia in most cases65 the likelihood of hyperglycaemia remission however depends upon how soon an operation is done during the natural history of diabetes algorithms designed to predict surgical remission eg diarem-2 ad-diarem diabetter and abcd68 69 70 71 consistently show that longstanding disease is one of the most powerful indicators of failure to achieve this benefit72 remission rates drop off notably after 10 years of diabetes moreover the sos study73 reported substantially lower type 2 diabetes remission among patients with only 4 years of known disease than in those with 2 years of known disease thus delaying metabolic surgery reduces the chances of diabetes remissiondelayed metabolic surgery might cause even greater harm to patients with type 2 diabetes who are at higher risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality especially when medications and lifestyle interventions are not achieving adequate metabolic control patients without diabetes but with severe respiratory obesity hypoventilation syndrome cardiac or renal complications of obesity and individuals for whom weight reduction is crucial to advancing time-sensitive and life-saving treatments eg organ transplants also have greater risks of harm from delaying bariatric and metabolic surgerypatients with surgically remediable metabolic diseases especially diabetes incur more health-care costs per day than do those without these conditions all studies that compared costs for 15 years between surgical and non-surgical patients found that pharmacy expenses decrease substantially after bariatric and metabolic surgery compared with matched non-surgical patients74 75 76 77 78 primarily due to lower diabetes medication costs69 hence metabolic surgery decreases daily health-care costs especially for patients requiring multidrug therapy the longer surgery is delayed for these patients the less cost-saving it becomesvarious non-surgical options can be used to mitigate the harm from delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery and to manage patients who have had surgery panel 1
 regarding the need to optimise glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes especially those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications79 we considered available evidence of pharmacological strategies that promote weight loss such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists glp-1ra or sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 sglt-2 inhibitors or both80 glp-1ras reduce hba1c by about 181 while promoting clinically relevant weight loss82 sglt-2 inhibitors however might be contraindicated with covid-19 because of concerns about potential subclinical vascular congestion and risk of acute metabolic decompensation associated with these drugs83

non-surgical options to mitigate harm from delaying surgery

glycaemic control should be optimised in patients awaiting metabolic surgery for type 2 diabetes especially for those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications this is desirable to prepare for surgery and also in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infectionin patients who do not achieve glycaemic targets with lifestyle modifications and metformin the addition of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist glp-1ra or sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 sglt-2 inhibitor or both can advance the combined goals of improving metabolic control and causing weight loss or limiting weight gain use of sglt-2 inhibitors however is not recommended in the case of acute coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infection because of concerns about potential subclinical vascular congestion and risk of acute metabolic decompensation associated with these drugsfor patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities who face prolonged waiting times for surgery dietary or pharmacological interventions for weight control might become necessarydiets with higher protein content and lower glycaemic index can be effective and should be consideredamong patients already taking weight-loss medications efforts should be made to continue the drugs until surgery is scheduled since rapid weight regain is predictable when they are discontinuedin countries where weight-loss medications eg phentermine orlistat glp-1ras naltrexonebupropion and phenterminetopiramate are accessible clinicians could consider their use when weight loss or weight maintenance is important such as for patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities

management of patients who have had surgery

telemedicine strategies that are supervised by specialist bariatric and metabolic surgery providers should be usedin people with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after surgery weight-reducing diabetes medications eg glp-1ras should be considered weight maintenance should also be encouraged in patients with type 2 diabetes remission to mitigate risk of disease recurrencethere is insufficient evidence to justify deviations from current evidence-based recommendations for postoperative nutritional care in patients who have had bariatric and metabolic surgeryto minimise risk of nutrition-related complications providers should engage with patients at the same intervals as in current guidelinesclinical signs eg weight visual changes rash weakness oedema or anasarca and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms eg nausea tingling bowel-habit changes and fatigue of nutritional deficiency must be assessed during virtual clinic sessionsroutine laboratory tests eg albumin thiamine b12 vitamin a vitamin d iron and calcium should not be deferred but obtained at standard intervals particularly for patients who had operations with greater risk of nutrient malabsorption such as long-limb diversionary proceduresurgent face-to-face meetings and laboratory tests are mandated when symptoms suggest severe biochemical deficiencies or surgical complications eg intestinal obstruction or acute cholecystitis

preparation for surgery and surgical technique

misconceptions and stigma about obesity and bariatric and metabolic surgery might further penalise candidates for surgical treatment of obesity and diabetes in times of limited resources clinicians policy makers and hospital managers should recognise the seriousness of the diseases that require metabolic and bariatric surgery and ensure that these operations are not further delayedgiven the risks of severe complications from covid-19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes covid-19 screening should be mandatory preoperatively for patients considering bariatric and metabolic surgerydespite the potential higher risk of contagion for staff the risk and benefit of a laparoscopic approach remain favourable for patients and should be preferred over the use of open techniquesappropriate personal protective equipment should be used as recommended by professional bodies and public health agencies to minimise risk for staff and operators
we also considered available data regarding the efficacy of dietary or pharmacological interventions for weight loss84 85 86 87 88 or both as a strategy to achieve weight loss or weight maintenance in patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities who face prolonged waiting times for bariatric and metabolic surgery regarding strategies to maximise surgical outcomes in patients who have already had surgery our recommendations are based on results from studies investigating the efficacy of pharmacological approaches in people with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after surgery among these individuals a recent study89 showed that the glp-1ra liraglutide can reduce hba1c by 12 with up to 5 additional weight loss we reviewed existing evidence-based recommendations for postoperative nutritional care79 to define safe and pragmatic methods of virtual consultation by telemedicine panel 1the prioritisation of any elective operation should seek to facilitate access according to clinical need maximise equity of access and minimise the harm from delayed access we have adapted previous categorisations of elective surgery7 to define an objective prioritisation system reflecting these principles for bariatric and metabolic operations panel 2

patients conditions are unlikely to deteriorate within 6 monthsonly mild dysfunction or symptomsdelaying surgical treatment beyond 90 days is unlikely to significantly reduce effectiveness of surgery
given the factors contributing to morbidity and mortality in obesity and type 2 diabetes surgical prioritisation should be based on disease-specific considerations for patients with type 2 diabetes we suggest that surgery be prioritised for patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality this risk would be indicated by poor glycaemic control despite maximal medical therapy use of insulin previous cardiovascular disease albuminuria and chronic kidney disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or multiple cardiometabolic comorbidities28 insulin use is a meaningful prioritisation criterion because it correlates with increased cardiovascular mortality28 and reduced quality of life92 moreover metabolic surgery reduces or abolishes the need for insulin in most patients1 47 52 to mitigate the risk of substantially reducing treatment efficacy we suggest prioritising surgery in patients with more than 5 years of diabetes this suggestion is based on evidence that individuals with shorter diabetes duration have greater chances of achieving disease remission92 whereas type 2 diabetes duration of 810 years remits far less often postoperatively1 65 93
the severity of obesity-associated symptoms eg mobility issues or joint pain as a consequence of extremely high bmi regardless of comorbidities must also be considered when establishing priorities equally important is the effect of obesity-related conditions that increase morbidity and mortality eg obesity hypoventilation syndrome chronic kidney disease or severe obstructive sleep apnoea38 the availability of non-surgical options that slow disease progression ie pharmacological diabetes treatments achieving adequate glycaemic control reduces need for prioritisation expedited access to surgery should also be considered when bariatric and metabolic operations are used as adjuvant therapy to enable other time-sensitive treatments that are made unfeasible or unsafe by excess weight poor metabolic control or both figuremany candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from comorbid conditions for these patients access to surgical treatment should be prioritised on the basis of disease-focused clinical needs rather than primarily on bmi to mitigate harm from delaying surgery this approach is especially needed in periods in which access to surgery is reduced as in the current covid-19 pandemic societal crises often spur developments that provide benefits long after the storm passes disease-oriented medically meaningful strategies to triage patients seeking metabolic surgery after the covid-19 crisis should help prioritise patients in more urgent need both now and long into the future
we did a rapid narrative literature review for this personal view for references about the effect of viral infections including coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on diabetes obesity and laparoscopic surgery we searched pubmed for articles in english published between jan 1 2002 and april 10 2020 we used combinations of terms such as sars h1n1 coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 diabetes obesity bmi laparoscopy endoscopy severe acute respiratory syndrome acute respiratory distress syndrome and co-morbiditieswe also reviewed recent guidelines from professional organisations and public health agencies about elective surgery and the covid-19 pandemic for evidence about the benefits of bariatric and metabolic surgery the predicting factors of morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and the classification of elective surgery we reviewed recently published systematic reviews and consensus statements by major scientific societies and relevant individual articles cited in these documentsmembers of the expert panel were selected on the basis of their previous participation in the diabetes surgery summit series and their relevant expertise additional experts were also invited to join the group and provide complementary expertise or ensure global representation or both a subgroup of the expert panel did a first appraisal of the evidence and draft recommendations and they generated the first draft of the report synthetising the literature review in response to each specific query the entire expert group then engaged in online discussion to further appraise the evidence and refine the final consensus recommendations
in december 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin has been reported in wuhan china only a few days later chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with coronavirus hui et al 2020 and the disease caused by it was named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by who confirmed by comparative homology analysis covid-19 is closely associated with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 with 88 identity but is far away from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov about 79 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov about 50 lu et al 2020 a total of 77 658 confirmed cases including 9 162 with severe illnesses and 2 663 deaths had been reported as of february 25 2020 by the national health commission of the peoples republic of chinahuang et al firstly reported the clinical features of 41 confirmed patients and indicated 13 32 of them had underlying diseases huang et al 2020 including cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subsequently wang et al reported findings from 138 cases of covid-19 the results suggested that 64 464 of them had comorbidities importantly the patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit icu had a higher number of comorbidities 722 than those not admitted to the icu 373 this suggested that comorbidities maybe risk factors for adverse outcomes wang et al 2020 assessing the prevalence of these chronic diseases are the basis for mitigating complications in patients infected with sars-cov-2 however the effort was hampered by the limited number of casesto get more convincing results we will provide a systematic evaluation and detail which will not only estimate the prevalence of comorbidities in all patients but also assess the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients the results may aid in patient management while helping to develop policies for prevention and response to covid-19 and its critical outcomesa systematic search was conducted on studies published from january 1 2019 to february 25 2020 in pubmed embase and web of science databases records were managed by endnote x90 software to exclude duplicates according to the indices of the various databases we use the search term 2019 novel coronavirus and covid-19 and comorbidities clinical characteristics epidemiological without any language restriction to identify missing studies we checked the reference list for each selected paper eligible were those that described the epidemiological clinical features of covid-19 and the prevalence of chronic diseases in infected patients studies that were a duplicate publications b reviews editorials case reports letters and family-based studies or c only have childrens cases were excluded the steps of the literature search are shown in figure 1

meta-analysis was based on data from 7 studies with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 all cases were from hospitals in china the results observed males took a larger amount than females statistics showed about 890686 in the covid-19 patients the results consisted with that the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc reported the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 mers-cov and sars-cov have also been found that males are more likely to be infected than females badawi and ryoo 2016 channappanavar et al 2017 it is customary to think women are less likely to be affected by many bacteria and viruses than are men partly because of their more robust innate and adaptive immune responses jaillon et al 2019 elderly people and severe patients are more susceptible to sars-cov-2 which may be associated with a higher frequency of comorbidities zhang et al 2020aa meta-analysis of the comorbidities suggested that hypertension was prevalent in approximately 211 of the patients diabetes cardiovascular disease and respiratory system disease were present in 97 84 and 15 of the cases respectively hypertension and diabetes mellitus consistent with the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in china were 232 hu et al 2019 and 109 liu et al 2019 in adults a recent study about influenza illness suggested that compared to patients with no comorbidities the risk of death for severe patients was higher in those who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 149 95 ci 110201 and in those who had cardiovascular disease or 292 95 ci 176486 or hypertension or 149 95 ci 110210 mertz et al 2013 the comorbidities had also been noted to have similar effects in other respiratory illnesses such as mers badawi and ryoo 2016 in our study the associations were also observed in hypertension cardiovascular disease and respiratory system disease groups overall the severe patients were older wang et al 2020 and had more significant number of comorbid conditions than those who were non-severe these results may suggest that age and comorbidities are risk factors for critical patientsdiseases such as hypertension diabetes respiratory system disease cardiovascular disease and their susceptibility conditions may be linked to the pathogenesis of covid-19 chronic diseases share several standard features with infectious disorders such as the proinflammatory state and the attenuation of the innate immune response for instance diabetes occurs in part because the accumulation of activated innate immune cells in metabolic tissues leads to the release of inflammatory mediators especially il-1 and tnf which promote systemic insulin resistance and -cell damage odegaard and chawla 2012 additionally metabolic disorders may lead to low immune function by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function dooley and chaisson 2009 which may make individuals more susceptible to disease complications badawi and ryoo 2016 recently guo et al 2019 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia and found that the absolute count levels of cd3t cells cd3cd8 t cells and cd3cd4 t cells in the deceased group were significantly lower than those in the survival group suggesting that the levels of various inflammatory factors in the deceased group were higher than those in the survival group a prospective case control study about seasonal influenza was conducted by hong et al 2014 their results showed that diabetes and chronic cardiovascular disease were significantly related to development of complications and diabetes was an independent risk factor for severe seasonal influenza or 363 95 ci 1151151 p  002 furthermore a study analyzed the risk factors for patients with mers-cov infection finding diabetes smoking and heart disease were also significantly associated with mers-cov illness alraddadi et al 2016limitations of this meta-analysis should be addressed first high heterogeneity statistics could be found this may relate to the study designs and large variation among studies in the sample size 9 to 1 099 patients second different lengths of follow-up may miss the events leading to heterogeneity some patients in the included studies are still in hospital third because only a few studies compared the comorbidities of severe and non-severe patients we did not conduct sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysisif causality exists between chronic diseases and severe covid-19 patients it will help the health sector guide vulnerable populations and assess the risk of deterioration lau et al 2013 followed up the fiu vaccinations of 91 605 people with diabetes the results showed that the flu vaccine could decrease the incidence of influenza and pneumonia in people with diabetes aged 65 years by 43 and diabetes in elderly people 65 years by 55 the symptoms of covid-19 are similar to those of influenza e g fever cough or fatigue and the covid-19 outbreaks occured during a year of a high prevalence of respiratory diseases caused by influenza respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses vaccines can still be useful in preventing flu and will reduce possible confusion with the sars-cov-2 infection patel and jernigan 2020the people with hypertension diabetes respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease should be included in influenza and future sars-cov-2 vaccination recommendations given the limited level of evidence more adequately powered studies should be conducted to prove the association the prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing year by year and targeted public health vaccination interventions must be adopted to better protect people with chronic diseases from infection with sars-cov-2 and other respiratory virusesthe authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this workthe study does not require ethical approval because the meta-analysis is based on published research and the original data are anonymoussince the first case in china in december 2019 the epidemic of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 virus rapidly spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the world health organization on 11 march 2020 1 2it is well known that people with diabetes have increased infection risk especially for influenza and pneumonia 3 4 moreover diabetes was previously reported as a major risk factor for mortality in people infected with the 2009 h1n1 pandemic influenza and more recently with the middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-cov 5 6 epidemiological studies have quickly and consistently pointed out diabetes as one of the major comorbidities associated with covid-19 and affecting its severitythe prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 was first reported to range from 5 to 20 in chinese studies increasing with the severity of the disease 7 more recently grasselli et al have reported a diabetes prevalence of 17 in patients admitted to intensive care units icus for severe covid-19 infection in lombardy italy 8 furthermore the covid-19-associated hospitalisation surveillance network covid-net reported a diabetes prevalence of 283 in hospitalised patients in the usa 9more importantly all studies published so far have reported a two- to threefold higher prevalence of diabetes in patients in icus compared with those with less severe disease and an increased mortality in people with diabetes 1014 for instance in a retrospective study from wuhan diabetes was present in 19 of 191 covid-19 inpatients but its prevalence raised to 31 in deceased people compared with 14 in those who survived 12 a recent meta-analysis further demonstrated that diabetes was associated with a more than doubled risk for icu admission and a more than tripled risk for death 14in this context patients with diabetes have been listed as people at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 by several health authorities and learned medical societies 15 however precise data regarding diabetes characteristics in hospitalised people with covid-19 are still lacking moreover the relationship between diabetes-related phenotypes and the severity of covid-19 remains unknown coronado coronavirus sars-cov-2 and diabetes outcomes is a nationwide multicentre observational study that aims to identify the clinical and biological features associated with disease severity and mortality risk in people with diabetes hospitalised for covid-19the coronado study was launched in all french hospitals volunteering to share data on hospitalised covid-19 patients with diabetes the study was sponsored by chu centre hospitalier universitaire nantes designed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and conducted in accordance with french legislation with approval obtained from the local ethics committee institutional review boardinstitutional ethics committee  gneds groupe nantais dthique dans le domaine de la sant ref coronadov2 the cerees comit dexpertise pour les recherches les tudes et les valuations dans le domaine de la sant n inds institut national des donnes de sant1544730 and the cnil commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts dr-2020-155920129 in light of the purely non-interventional design of this observational study and the emergency situation related to the covid-19 pandemic the cnil and the gneds have repealed the systematic collection of written informed consent they recommended that we collect an oral non-opposition to participate as far as possible in particular by publishing study information via posters in the hospitals living patients who were unable to give consent on admission all received information about their inclusion in the coronado study before discharge and therefore had a clear and free choice to object to the use of their clinical data any patient declining to participate in the study or expressing his or her opposition to data collection from hospital information systems even after hospital discharge was excluded from the studythe aim of the coronado study was to describe the phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of individuals admitted to hospital with covid-19 between 10 march and 10 april 2020 inclusion criteria were 1 hospitalisation in a dedicated covid-19 unit with covid-19 diagnosis confirmed biologically by sars-cov-2 pcr test andor clinicallyradiologically ie as ground-glass opacity andor crazy paving on chest computed tomography ct scan 2 personal history of diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes on admission ie hba1c 48 mmolmol 65 during hospitalisationowing to the rapid recruitment rate and in order to make clinically relevant findings available as quickly as possible the scientific committee on 5 april 2020 suggested a premature database lock on 18 april 2020 for participants admitted in the period 1031 march 2020 and continuation of recruitment with no further modification a first set of analyses was performed in 1317 participants selected according to the following criteria 1 meeting the eligibility criteria 2 available information on the main outcome recorded on day 7 following admission 3 available data on age and sex see flowchart in fig 1the composite primary endpoint combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and death within 7 days of admission secondary outcomes included death on day 7 tracheal intubation on day 7 admission to icus and discharge on day 7 participants discharged before day 7 were systematically contacted to check for the non-occurrence of these events on day 7data collection was performed by clinical research associates and physicians in participating centres they were instructed to systematically review the medical files of all covid-19 inpatients select those with diabetes extract data from their medical files and if needed contact the patients general andor specialist practitioners regular pharmacist or biomedical laboratory collected data included clinical data age sex ethnicity bmi classification of diabetes as noted in the medical file by the physician in charge of the patient duration of diabetes recent glycaemic control ie two most recent hba1c levels determined before admission microvascular and macrovascular complications and comorbidities hba1c considered in the analysis was determined locally in the 7 days following admission or if not available was the result of a routine determination in the previous 6 months microvascular complications were defined as severe diabetic retinopathy proliferative retinopathy andor laser photocoagulation andor clinically significant macular oedema requiring laser andor intra-vitreal injections andor diabetic kidney disease proteinuria aer 300 mg24 h urinary albumincreatinine ratio 300 mgg urinary albumincreatinine ratio 30 mgmmol creatinine proteinuria 500

were defined as ischaemic heart disease acute coronary syndrome andor coronary artery revascularisation andor cerebrovascular disease stroke andor transient ischaemic attack andor peripheral artery disease amputation owing to ischaemic disease andor lower limb artery revascularisation in addition covid-19-related clinical radiological and biological characteristics were collected at admission as well as their clinical evolution during the hospital stayquantitative data were expressed as mean  sd or median 25th 75th percentile categorical variables were given as number percentage of participants as prespecified in the protocol the main objective of the study was descriptive we calculated that a population size of 300 participants with an attrition of 20 for missing data and a percentage of 16 of our main outcome would give us a 95 ci equal to 117211 using the clopperpearson estimateunivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate or associated with primary outcome or death on day 7 natural log transformation was consistently considered in cases of skewed distribution which applied to bmi and biological featuresage- and sex-adjusted ors for the primary outcome were plotted for bmi hba1c and admission plasma glucose using degree 2 fractional polynomial approaches 16multivariable logistic regression models were used to separately assess the association of the primary outcome and death on day 7 with clinical and biological features a standardisation process was also applied using z scores for the purpose of direct comparison in our initial statistical analysis plan four covariates were systematically forced in the models age sex bmi and hba1c however since hba1c did not contribute to the risk of either the primary outcome or death on day 7 and owing to a significant number of missing data for hba1c and bmi our multivariable models ultimately took only age and sex into account other variables were considered only if associated with the main outcome in univariate analysis threshold two-sided p value 010 and selected in the final model after a stepwise backwardforward selection process in the event of obvious collinearity such as alanine aminotransferase alt with aspartate aminotransferase ast or white cell count with lymphocyte count only the variable associated with the smaller p value was considered for multivariable analysis in the final model interactions were checked between all pairs of covariateswe built two distinct multivariable models both separately for the main outcome and for the risk of death 1 the first included covariates related to patient history prior to admission chronic diabetes complications and other comorbidities and routine medications 2 the second included covariates related to medical presentation on admission such as covid-19 symptoms and biological determinations this corresponds to the situation of a physician in an emergency room or department assessing the prognosis of hisher patientall statistical tests were two-sided with a type 1 error set at 5 all analyses were performed on available data without imputation and using statistical software r version

electronic supplementary material esm table 1furthermore several characteristics prior to admission were associated with the risk of death on day 7 including age hypertension micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications and comorbidities such as heart failure or treated obstructive sleep apnoea osa among prior medications metformin use was lower in people who died in contrast insulin therapy raas blockers -blockers loop diuretics and mras were found to be associated with death on day 7 table 1 and esm table 1when using age- and sex-adjusted nonlinear models bmi was significantly and positively associated with the primary outcome p  00001 but not with death on day 7 p  01488 fig 2 in contrast hba1c level was neither associated with the primary outcome nor with death on day 7multivariable analyses were then conducted with characteristics prior to admission bmi remained associated with the primary outcome in a model where sex and age were forced into models when comorbidities and routine treatment were entered in an adjusted model with stepwise selection bmi was the only independent factor associated with the primary outcome with an adjusted or of 128 95 ci 110 147 table 3 finally age history of microvascular or macrovascular complications and treated osa were found to be independently associated with the risk of death on day 7 table 4 a sensitivity analysis conducted only in patients with a positive sars-cov-2 pcr test found similar results for both the primary outcome and death data not shownregarding covid-19 symptoms on admission dyspnoea was positively associated with the primary outcome and with death on day 7 whereas cephalalgia upper respiratory tract symptoms rhinitis andor pharyngeal symptoms and ageusiaanosmia as well as time between symptom onset and admission were negatively associated with death on day 7 table 2 and esm table 2 several biological parameters reflecting the severity of the infection were also associated with both primary outcome and death on day 7 such as crp creatine phosphokinase cpk and lymphopaenia reduced kidney function assessed by admission egfr and increased plasma ast level was associated with both outcomes table 2 and esm table 2 in age- and sex-adjusted nonlinear models admission plasma glucose was significantly and positively associated with the primary outcome p  00001 and with death on day 7 p  00059 fig 2the prognostic value of characteristics on admission was finally investigated in multivariable models table 5 among clinical symptoms dyspnoea was the only predictor of the primary outcome regarding biological parameters lymphopaenia on admission was independently associated with the primary outcome as were increased ast and crp concentrations dyspnoea and plasma levels of both ast and crp were also independently associated with the risk of death on day 7 as well as decrease in platelet count and egfr table 6 once again similar results were obtained for both the primary outcome and death on day 7 when considering only the patients with a positive pcr test data not showncoronado is the first study specifically dedicated to people with diabetes infected with sars-cov-2 and admitted to hospital coronado was designed to address three main goals 1 assess the phenotypic characteristics of patients with diabetes hospitalised for covid-19 2 estimate the prevalence of the primary outcome which combines death and tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation within the first 7 days following admission 3 identify in this specific population certain prognostic factors associated with early severity of covid-19 when considering variables prior to admission our results support no independent association between a severe course of covid-19 and age sex long-term glucose control chronic complications hypertension or usual medications including raas blockers and dpp-4 inhibitors only bmi turned out to be independently associated with the primary outcome when considering variables on admission dyspnoea lymphopaenia and increased ast and crp levels were independent prognostic factors for severe course of covid-19to our knowledge coronado is the first study that provides precise information regarding the characteristics of diabetes in the severe forms of covid-19 the study population roughly resembles the french population of people living with diabetes except for hba1c which was clearly higher in our study 65 mmolmol 81 compared with the nationwide entred-2 survey participants older than 65 years 54 mmolmol 71 17 of note there was no overrepresentation of declared type 1 diabetes only 30 of participants in people with diabetes hospitalised for covid-19the primary outcome occurred in 290 of coronado participants while the design of the present study did not enable comparison of the severity of covid-19 in people with or without diabetes 203 of the study population required tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation with a mortality rate of 106 as early as 7 days after admission the severity of the prognosis of covid-19 observed in people with diabetes in the present study is in accordance with previous epidemiological studies 1013 18 19 and meta-analyses 14 20 an important issue is the choice of our primary endpoint which combines death an unequivocal outcome with tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation it should be emphasised that the latter outcome can result from different factors which were impossible to standardise in all centres such as 1 clinical deterioration 2 refusal to be intubated or 3 futility ie a medical decision not to intubate leading to potentially fewer patients actually intubated compared with those meeting intubation criteriaregarding the clinical characteristics of covid-19 in coronado participants there was a high prevalence of fever and respiratory symptoms cough dyspnoea and to a lesser extent digestive disorders in addition to symptoms directly related to covid-19 people with diabetes can also require management of acute metabolic disorders in particular physicians should be warned not only of the risk of ketoacidosis but also of hypoglycaemia probably favoured by covid-19-induced anorexia without concomitant adaptation of glucose-lowering drugswith the aim of providing clinicians with criteria to evaluate the risk of severe covid-19 on an individual level in people with diabetes we performed multivariable analyses to identify pre-admission and on-admission prognostic factors since some preclinical studies previously highlighted potential mechanistic links between glucose control immune response and mers-cov infection 21 we were particularly interested in studying the relationship between long-term glucose control and covid-19 prognosis in fact we failed to find any association between hba1c even with the highest values 75 mmolmol 90 and either the primary outcome or death on day 7 on the basis of this result and in order to increase the sample size for our analyses we decided not to force hba1c in the multivariate modelsan interesting finding is the association of bmi with study outcomes indeed in our study bmi was positively and independently associated with the primary outcome which is largely driven by tracheal intubation interestingly a recent report on covid-19 patients in icu showed an association between bmi and the requirement for mechanical ventilation irrespective of diabetic status 22 however such an association with bmi was no longer statistically significant when considering death on day 7 it should also be noted that the increased risk for the primary outcome appears to be less pronounced in patients with morbid obesity grade 3 bmi 40 kgm2 compared with those who were overweight or with grade 12 obesity a situation previously described as the obesity paradox in icus 23 additional studies are clearly warranted to decipher the link between obesity metabolic complications and covid-19 severity with specific attention to fat mass distribution insulin resistance and inflammatoryimmune profileswhile hypertension was previously reported as the most prevalent comorbidity in the general population with severe covid-19 2 9 12 it was not independently associated with the severity of the disease in the study in addition raas blockers ace inhibitors arbs and mras were not independently associated with the main outcome supporting the recent recommendation not to discontinue raas blockade 24 moreover we found no association between glucose-lowering drugs including dpp-4 inhibitors that have been suggested to potentially interfere with coronavirus infection and covid-19 prognosis 21 25our complementary multivariable approach was suitable for the identification of characteristics on admission associated with covid-19 prognosis of particular relevance for the management of people with diabetes in the setting of an emergency room notably we found an age- and sex-independent association between increased admission plasma glucose levels and the severity of covid-19 as previously reported in critically ill patients 26 however we speculate that this observation is rather the consequence of the severity of the infection than a causal primary factoranother important result concerns the identification of the prognostic factors of early death in people with diabetes and covid-19 compared with the primary outcome which reflects aggressive management in icus with tracheal intubation death on day 7 was more prevalent in elderly participants with an or 14 for people older than 75 years compared with younger individuals in addition these individuals also very frequently exhibited complications of diabetes microvascular and macrovascular complications mainly coronary heart disease as well as pulmonary diseases such as osa as expected they were also more frequently on insulin therapy and taking multiple drugs such as diuretics conversely metformin use was associated with a reduced risk of early death probably reflecting a less advanced stage of diabetes with fewer comorbidities such as severe chronic kidney disease that contraindicate its use in multivariable analyses age diabetic complications and treated osa remained significantly and independently associated with death on day 7 in addition dyspnoea reduced egfr and platelet count and increased ast and crp on admission were independent markers of early deaththe discrepancy between the primary combined outcome mainly driven by tracheal intubation and death on day 7 could be explained by the fact that there were medical decisions not to pursue aggressive therapy in this frail population in contrast our data can be considered reassuring for the majority of people living with type 1 diabetes indeed there was no death in participants with type 1 diabetes younger than 65 years additional data collection is currently ongoing to provide a precise picture of the rare individuals with type 1 diabetes hospitalised for covid-19some limitations must be acknowledged in the current analysis we focused on hospitalised covid-19 cases and our results cannot be generalised to all people with covid-19 and diabetes especially those with a less severe form of the disease a secondary limitation is the size of our study population and the large proportion ie 357 of patients without available hba1c this is in accordance with the observation that only 55 of the people with diabetes had had three or more hba1c determinations in the previous year according to french national registry data 27 finally the present report focuses only on short-term prognosis ie 7 days after admission and one cannot exclude the possibility that diabetes characteristics prior to admission could be associated with severe covid-19 outcomes in the longer term however strengths must be acknowledged such as the originality of the medical question leading to the coronado initiative and the inclusion of participants on a national basis in addition a large majority 93 of covid-19 cases were confirmed with a positive pcr test with few cases diagnosed from medical andor radiological observations only we also structured data collection in order to obtain a precise and standardised recording of phenotypic characteristics of the diabetic study populationin conclusion the coronado study refined the phenotypes of covid-19 individuals with diabetes admitted to hospital and showed that chronic glycaemic control did not impact the immediate severity of covid-19 elderly populations with long-term diabetes with advanced diabetic complications andor treated osa were particularly at risk of early death and might require specific management to avoid contamination with sars-cov-2 bmi also appears as an independent prognostic factor for covid-19 severity in the population living with diabetes requiring hospital admissionnamed by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the novel coronavirus with origin associated with the city of wuhan hubei province china spread rapidly worldwide causing thousands of deaths characterizing the infection as a public health problem of global interest 12 with a high infectivity rate the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 reached pandemic proportions 3according to the report published by world health organization who on june 1st the number of confirmed cases reaches 6057853 distributed in 216 countries with emphasis on the european and american continents with more than two million cases each together adding up around 82 of infected global number covid-19 has already killed more than 371166 people worldwide especially among elderly patients and individuals with comorbidities currently the united states us has already more than 1734040 confirmed cases but despite its large number of infected people it is countries like spain 29045 deaths italy 33415 deaths and the united kingdom 38489 deaths which presented the highest mortality rate exceeding 10 4the disease evolution and the symptoms vary from asymptomatic patients to severe cases of respiratory failure which can lead to death 5 some risk factors may be associated with the evolution and disease severity in a study conducted in the us during march 2020 with 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in fourteen states 12 of the total were history of comorbidities of this total 497 were hypertensive 483 were obese patients with chronic liver diseases totaled 346 diabetics represented 283 and people with cardiovascular diseases were 278 6 in another study conducted in wuhan city china 191 patients with covid-19 were followed up of which 48 had comorbidities such as hypertension 30 diabetes 19 and coronary disease 8 7 until june 1st 2020 brazil had 347398 confirmed cases of covid-19 with 13868 deaths associated with comorbidities heart disease was the most common comorbidity with total of 7318 deaths followed by diabetes kidney disease neurological disease pneumopathy obesity immunosuppression and asthma with a total of 5627 1218 1159 1061 742 740 and 397 deaths respectively 8in this context metabolic syndrome ms is inserted as a common denominator to these comorbidities since it is defined as a set of metabolic disorders that include insulin resistance dyslipidemia central obesity and hypertension which are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases 910 in 2017 it was estimated that ms affected 20 of north american population 25 of european population and approximately 15 of chinese population 1112 in this scenario the relationship between ms and its comorbidities that aggravate the covid-19 prognosis cannot be ignored also its presence in different ethnicities and continents places sm as an important risk factor for covid-19 thus this review is aimed at providing overview of metabolic changes associated with ms and its relationship with development and worsening of sars-cov-2 infection as well as to review the proposed drugs for the treatment of these patients we collated and discussed the available evidences that have emerged so far on the presence of obesity diabetes cardiovascular and liver disease in the patients with covid-19 and proposed therapieswe systematically searched the pubmed and google scholar databases until june 1st 2020 using the keywords covid-19 metabolic syndrome and following terms obesity diabetes liver nafld hypertension cardiovascular disease chloroquine hydroxychloroquine antiretroviral drugs and treatment of coronavirus we also accessed the full text of the relevant cross references from the search resultsthe who points obesity as a global epidemic estimating that in 2016 more than 650 million people over aged 18 years were obese worldwide 12 since obesity is a risk factor for several diseases including infectious ones these data become even more alarming 13 the bodies of obese patients are in constant chronic inflammation due to the high concentrations of chemokines adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines this chronic inflammation causes a delayed and inferior immune response with decreased activation of macrophages in infection course in addition the immune memory of obese individuals is also impaired both humoral and cellular weakening both adaptive response of immune system to disease and immunization of these patients 13 14 15obesity had previously been identified as a risk factor for viral infections due to its influence on immune response 15 during the 2009 h1n1 outbreak obese patients had more stringent complications and care needs 14 in relation to covid-19 research points to the high rate of obese patients with complications and need for hospitalization 16 a study carried out in new york city nyc us showed that among the 3615 patients who tested positive for covid-19 21 had obesity and 16 of total had a body mass index bmi  35 kgm2 severe obesity being much more likely to develop the most severe forms of the disease these patients had a greater need for hospitalization and care in the intensive care unit icu 17 in another study also in nyc that followed 4103 patients with covid-19 of which 1999 489 were hospitalized it was observed that individuals with bmi  40 kgm2 were six times more likely to be hospitalized 18 in a retrospective study of 112 patients with covid-19 conducted at a hospital in wuhan city the bmi of patients in critical group bmi  25 kgm2 was significantly higher than the non-critical group and of 17 patients who died 15 882 had a bmi  25 kgm2 19in view of alarming number of cases in countries like the us where it is estimated that around 36 of population is obese 20 and in europe where according to the most recent who estimates obesity affects 1030 of the population 21 obesity represents a serious problem when related to covid-19 these data reflect the current alarming situation faced by european countries such as those already mentioned the united kingdom italy spain and also the us and brazil whose number of serious cases and deaths tops the global statistics pointing to obesity as risk factor for covid-19 mortality 4in 2016 diabetes was seventh most deadly disease worldwide with approximately 16 million deaths directly 22 it represents a risk factor for the development of other pathologies standing out as a disease of great medical interest 23 its relationship with infectious diseases is not yet fully understood however in addition to suppressing the patients immunity it can cause metabolic dysfunction that directly affects homeostasis of the entire organism 24in a study about relationship between diabetes morbidity and mortality rate among patients with sars-cov it was observed that patients with a known history of diabetes who died were 215 versus 39 of diabetic survivors 25 diabetes patients have been reported to have up to four times more chance of hospitalization during the h1n1 pandemic 26 like sars-cov and h1n1 diabetes appears as a comorbidity with potential to aggravate and lead to death by the sars-cov-2 infection in a meta-analysis that included more than 40000 infected people from wuhan hubei province china 8 of these were diabetic patients 27 in another study conducted in wuhan 191 patients were followed up and 54 died among non-survivors 31 were diabetic 28 the death rate reported by the chinese center for disease control for more than 70000 cases was 23 but this was increased to 73 when analyzed diabetics patients in the same group 29diabetes has been identified as the second most common comorbidity among cases of covid-19 hypotheses have been raised that this high incidence rate in diabetic patients is directly linked to high gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in their cells which are used by sars-cov-2 to enter human cells due to treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers arbs 30 this would not only increase the risk of these patients to infection but would also make it difficult to control comorbidity during treatment against covid-19 this relationship is not yet fully understood and further studies are needed to confirm it since the drug treatment protocols for diabetic patients remain the same for their metabolic dysfunction 31hypertension has appeared in research in various countries and continents as the most common comorbidity among those infected with sars-cov-2 5 6 7272830 as well as cardiovascular diseases cvd that appear as risk factors for severe complications of covid-19 arterial hypertension heart failure and arrhythmia are some of diseases of the cardiovascular system that can generate several complications in sars-cov-2 infection course 32in an analysis of 99 patients with covid-19 it was observed that 21 of patients had problems such as hypertension or coronary heart disease and of the 32 patients who developed severe forms of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 17 individuals had some heart disease 33 a meta-analysis involving more than 3000 patients with covid-19 found that patients with cvd are up to five times more likely to develop the disease critical stage 34 data from the chinese center for disease control and prevention pointed a 23 mortality rate in a group of 44672 infected with covid-19 however this number was much higher among patients with hypertension and cvd reaching 6 and 105 respectively 32in addition to history of cvd being an aggravating factor in covid-19 development cardiovascular complications can also be result of the infection acute myocardial injury has been observed in 8 of confirmed cases of disease with an elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i found in up to 12 of cases while the troponin among patients with mild symptoms of infection was found in low concentration 3235 in the investigation 187 patients with covid-19 were evaluated of the 36 patients who had a history of cvd and died 25 had high troponin levels 35the high concentration of ace2 in cardiac tissue can be pointed out as possible mechanism for the lesions since this enzyme is used by sars-cov-2 to invade the cell making the heart a favorable site for viral colonization as in diabetes many of drugs used to treat hypertension act as ace inhibitors and arbs increasing ace2 expression in the individual 303236 as a highly active tissue with a high demand for energy produced by mitochondria hypoxia promoted by covid-19 can cause damage in the myocardium and have severe consequences for the infected patient 3235currently cvd are the main cause of death being responsible for 31 of deaths in 2016 much of this is reflection of eating habits and sedentary lifestyle that modern life has provided for the population ms is a contributing factor to the development of cvd and in the current pandemic scenario this sedentary lifestyle takes its toll 37the liver is an important organ for the most diverse body metabolic functions damage caused to hepatic tissue by covid-19 has been observed in addition pathologies that affect it are inserted as risk factors for complications and severe manifestations of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 38 like other organs liver cells especially bile duct cells have ace2 enzyme on their surface placing liver tissue as a possible infection site for the virus 39previously during the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-cov outbreak studies have shown direct action of virus on hepatocytes causing apoptosis in cells and inducing injury elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have also been found in patients with liver damage like the 2012 epidemic by middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus mers-cov liver damage caused by infection was observed in infected patients however unlike sars-cov and sars-cov-2 mers-cov uses another receptor to invade the cell dipeptidyl-peptidase iv dpp-4 which is widely expressed in hepatocytes as with sars-cov infection high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines have been described in these patients 4041in the current pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus some studies have already observed abnormal concentrations of liver function markers in the study with 202 patients it was observed that patients with nafld had a higher risk of covid-19 progression and of the 39 patients with progressive condition 34 87 had nafld inflammation of liver tissue resulting from pro-inflammatory cytokines released by adipose tissue becomes even more aggravated by the pathogen presence such as sars-cov-2 with complications not fully clarified but potentially severe for infected patient 42 it was observed that approximately 2030 of patients with covid-19 had elevated transaminases especially in those with metabolic disorders associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld 4243it is not yet clear whether liver damage is primary caused directly by the virus and inflammatory reaction or secondary caused by drugs used in treatment and hypoxia caused by pneumonia however even if modest the changes exist and certainly the history of pre-existing liver disease tends to worsen the infection prognosis 4144in this context nafld which is considered the hepatic manifestation of ms characterized by the deposit of fat in liver tissue is inserted as a comorbidity subject to detailed observation 45 its prevalence is estimated between 20 and 30 in the population of western countries and between 5 and 18 among asian countries being significantly increased in obese and diabetic patients 46 researches on the relationship between nafld and covid-19 are still scarcein the absence of any known effective therapy and due to the pandemic situation recently many drugs in the treatment of covid-19 have been tested drugs previously proposed for the treatment of viral diseases including previous outbreaks by other coronavirus sars-cov and mers-cov began to be tested with emphasis on chloroquine and its hydroxychloroquine analog associated or not with azithromycin corticosteroids and other antiviral medications in patients with covid-19 4748 the proposed pharmacological treatments are summarized in table 1
 which shows the mechanism of action and adverse effects of drugsexperimental studies have suggested that chloroquine cq is a proven antimalarial drug that can inhibit the replication of various intracellular microorganisms including coronavirus in vitro 4950 it is suggested a possible inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication by terminal glycosylation of ace2 produced by pulmonary vessels inhibiting the link between virus and receptor inhibition of viral infection by raising the endosomal ph is also reported thus interfering with virus-cell fusion in addition it was observed that this medicine contributed to prevention of viral spread in cell cultures 47hydroxychloroquine hcq can also increase intracellular ph and inhibit lysosomal activity in antigen-presenting cells this process reduces t cell activation differentiation and expression of costimulatory proteins and production of cytokines in the cytoplasm it interferes with synthesis of viral nucleic acids attenuating pro-inflammatory response both mechanisms strengthen the hypothesis that hcq can suppress sars-cov-2 by inhibiting the hyperactivation of immune system triggered by the virus and thus reducing disease progression from mild to severe however still without clinical evidence 4950although hcq and cq have shown antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro hcq appears to have a more potent action furthermore hcq has a clinical safety superior to cq with its long-term use as it allows the use of higher doses and has few interactions with other drugs 51 a non-randomized controlled trial showed that azithromycin associated with hcq was significantly more efficient to eliminate virus where 70 of patients had no detectable viral load after 6 days of treatment however these drugs must be used carefully the azithromycin indiscriminate use being an antimicrobial can cause bacterial resistance the use of cq may cause an increase of qt interval retinopathy and cardiovascular disorders which should certainly be of concern in hypertensive patients 52the research warns to the adverse effects and real effectiveness of medications according to studies widespread use of hcq will expose patients to fatal consequences including skin reactions liver failure and ventricular arrhythmia especially if prescribed in association with azithromycin furthermore there is a risk that cq phosphate can cause acute poisoning or even death 53 54 55 56 researchers analyzed 1376 patients with covid-19 in new york city where 589 811 were treated with hcq of the treated total 346 developed respiratory failure 180 were intubated and 166 died without intubation according to the analysis patients who took hcq were more likely to develop respiratory failure than those who did not use it 54 this makes randomized controlled trials with hcq extremely necessary in patients with covid-19 mainly associated with metabolic disorderspatients who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes andor hypertension who are treated with ace inhibitors andor arbs have a considerable increase in eca2 receptors expression which may facilitate the virus entry the same authors report that patients using these drugs can develop severe and fatal covid-19 56 as an appropriate alternative treatment the use of calcium channel blockers as antihypertensive agents is suggested a patient-centered approach should be used to guide the choice of pharmacological agents considering age severity of covid-19 cardiovascular comorbidities and risk of hypoglycemia 5657another possibly promising drug is favipiravir a drug with proven action against ebola virus the drugs efficiency in reducing sars-cov-2 infection is due to the inhibition of rna polymerase activity 5859 a randomized clinical trial with 240 patients in china showed that favipiravir 7143 is more effective than arbidol 5586 in the treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension andor diabetes who used favipiravir experienced a reduction in fever and cough relief faster than patients who used arbidol however there was no difference in auxiliary oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation between patients 60antiretroviral drugs lopinavirritonavir an oral combination agent approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of hiv demonstrated in vitro activity against other coronaviruses by inhibiting 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 61 adverse effects of lopinavirritonavir include gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea and diarrhea up to 28 and hepatotoxicity 210 62 in patients with covid-19 these adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection 43remdesivir gs-5734 as adenosine nucleoside analogue prodrug has a broad-antiviral spectrum against phyloviruses paramyxoviruses pneumoviruses and coronaviruses 63 in vitro studies have shown the ability of remdesivir to inhibit coronaviruses replication in primary human lung cells 6364 patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 treated with compassionate-use remdesivir showed clinical improvement in 36 of 53 patients 68 65 well as showed shortened time to recovery and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection in the remdesivir group 66 however in another study remdesivir in adults with severe covid-19 was not associated with significant clinical benefits but the patients who received remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo with symptom duration of 10 days or less 67 in all studies adverse events were reported during follow-up of patients between 28 and 66 such as anemia or decreased hemoglobin thrombocytopenia acute kidney injury decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate increased blood creatinine increased total bilirubin hyperglycemia and increased aminotransferase levels which suggests clinical investigation in patients with complications associated with metabolic syndrome 65 66 67another potential adjuvant therapy for covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins 68 the justification for this treatment is that the antibodies of recovered patients can help in the immune response against the virus in individuals with covid-19 or be a preventive measure of infection in cases of vulnerable individuals with diverse metabolic disordersnitazoxanide traditionally an anthelmintic agent has broad antiviral activity and relatively favorable safety profile demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against mers and sars-cov-2 6970 in the lack of robust evidence antiviral activity immunomodulatory effects and safety profile of nitazoxanide justify further study as a therapeutic option for covid-19current evidence demonstrates the use of corticosteroids to decrease inflammatory responses in the lungs however this benefit can be overcome by its adverse effects including delayed viral clearance of the respiratory tract and blood and high rates of complications including hyperglycemia psychosis and avascular necrosis as well as increased risk of secondary infection although the direct evidence for the use of corticosteroids in covid-19 is limited result revisions in other viral pneumonias are instructive observational studies in patients with sars and mers have not reported an association of corticosteroids with improved survival 71 72 73 the risk of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients can be reduced although not eliminated by good glycemic controlalthough several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of covid-19 no therapy have yet been shown to be efficacious for patientsmetabolic syndrome is a risk factor that influences covid-19 progression and prognosis the prevalence of obese diabetic hypertensive or liver damage patients with severe cases of covid-19 in multiple countries demonstrates the importance of the care with this risk group in prophylaxis monitoring and treatment similarly the drugs currently evaluated for the infection treatment are promising but need further studies to prove their efficacy and safety due to the adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection the development of a vaccine for immunization is still the best long-term solution for the prevention of future outbreaks of sars-cov-2 in addition people of any age who have pre-existing diseases such as heart disease diabetes obesity among others also need to redouble their care in measures to prevent coronavirusthe world is experiencing a viral onslaught of herculean proportion in the form of covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 caused by sars-cov-2 severe acute 69 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 1 both the infection rate as well as death from covid 19 have exhibited an exponential growth 2 the whole attention now is on prevention and management strategies related to it however as the disease evolved we learned that not all patient population are at equal risk of morbidity and mortality the elderly and those with additional co-morbidities in the form of diabetes hypertension and background cardiovascular compromise are at higher risk than those without these co-morbid diseases 3india houses the second largest population of patient with diabetes mellitus after china 4 although the pandemic of covid 19 originated in china unlike diabetes prevalence india is as yet experienced lesser impact of covid19 5 in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus from individuals travelling into india from endemic areas to internal community spread a feature of the stage 3 of the disease process a temporary 21 days lockdown complete restriction on all international and domestic travel social isolation and suspension of all non-essential services as announced by prime minister of india on 24th march 2020 on one hand this could be a vital step in stemming the spread of the virus however on the other there are likely to be issues related to the impact of this lockdown on patients with diabetes the worsening of hyperglycaemia an increase in diabetes-related complications this could be due to the limitation of free space to exercise limited resources to implement a healthy lifestyle restrictions on the availability of anti-hyperglycaemic agents and difficulty in obtaining of physicians guidance further because of limitations of transport of goods and movement of patients there is likely to be shortage of drugs insulin and glucose testing strps and glucose meters all these factors have the potential to increase the stress level and its associated impact on the pre-existing diseasewhat impact will this lockdown have on the glycaemic target and diabetes-related complications while it is difficult to collect real data one could use a simulation model created with the aid of a multivariate regression analysis which could predict and answer these questions we hypothesised that this lockdown of india for period of 21 days and beyond will lead to worsening of glycemia and later increase in diabetes-related complicationsthis analysis was planned to answer above stated hypothesis in the absence of any previous data we searched for scenarios very similar to the lockdown situation and zeroed in to several disasters earthquakes tsunamis hurricanes and wars which closely simulatea lockdown in so far as resource limitations and challenges are concerned 6 7 8 9 10 11 for baseline glycosylated haemoglobin hba1ca1c and associated diabetes-related complications for indian population data from diabcare study was taken 12 using these parameters as baseline this analysis was planned aiming at predicting the end-of-lockdown hba1c as well as the diabetes-related complication rates thereofa web-based search was conducted addressing diabetes control during times of disaster when resources become scarce and lifestyle modification opportunities become constricted this background was selected to simulate the proposed 21 days lockdown in india facing the menace of coronavirus outbreak the disaster period was included to closely simulate the resource challenged atmosphere a search of pubmed google scholar and cochrane library was conducted using following search terms disaster diabetes mellitus blood glucose targets and diabetic complications as keywords subsequently clubbing disaster and diabetes mellitus yielded 7 citations and then combined with blood glucose targets and diabetes complications yielded 546 citations as per pre-planned inclusion criteria filters were imposed to include trials only resulting in 7 studies available for analysisthere were six citations related to disaster and diabetes mellitus which were included to analyse the predicted hba1c at the end of the lockdown the disasters included for analysis were hurricane katrina usa2005 days considered as lockdown period - 8 kobe earthquake japan1995 days considered as lockdown period - 8 hanshin-awashi earthquake japan 1995 days considered as lockdown period - 14 the gulf war in iraq 1991 days considered as lockdown period - 60 murmura earthquake turkey 1999 days considered as lockdown period  21 and the great eastern japan earthquake and tsunami japan 2011 days considered as lockdown period - 14 data was collected in a comma separated-values csv file and uploaded in jupyter notebook and analysed with the python 382 software windows 10 64 bit usa as a re-validation process and for simplicity of understanding the data was also analysed using excel with xl-stat statistical software windows 10 64 bit usa once the post-lockdown hba1c was available the plan was to include the seventh citation which was related to the indian data on the mean hba1c value of representative indian population 2014 and the prevalent diabetes-related micro-  macro-vascular complications this baseline data diabcare study was collected over one year from 330 centres across the country resulting in surveying 6168 diabetic patients 12 mean hba1c as well as the annual rates of complications was collected in this cross-sectional studythe final step planned was to predict the post lockdown complication rates depending on the predicted hba1c and the duration of lockdown in days these data were calculated with the premise that current state of conditions of the patients and constrained resources continue and that major intervention to control glycemia introduction of new drugs and insulin etc were not carried out
the results of this analysis are presented in five stepsstep 1the first step was to estimate the hba1c increment observed during the time period of the respective disasters table 1
the correlation analysis revealed a moderately good correlation between the post-disaster hba1c  the duration of the disaster r  048 and a strong correlation with baseline hba1c r  081step 3a multivariate regression analysis was done revealing a very strong association between the inputs days count and the baseline hba1c and the output post-disaster hba1c the relationship between days count and post-disaster hba1c was statistically significant p  0009 as was the relationship between the baseline hba1c and the post-disaster hba1c p  0004 the multivariate linear model was robust with a r2  099 and an adjusted r2  098 table 2
the formula generated by the multivariate regression analysis was post-disaster a1c  b0 b1 number of days of lock-down  b2baseline a1c inserting all the intercepts the equation turns out to be post-disaster a1c  095 009 number of days of lock-down  104baseline a1cwith increasing duration of the lockdown the increment in hba1c from baseline continues to increase and carries along with it the increasing annual complication rates the annual predicted percentage increment in complication rates from baseline at the end of 30-day lockdown due to covid19 pandemic was 28 for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy 29 for proliferative diabetic retinopathy 15 for retinal photocoagulation 93 for microalbuminuria 142 for overt proteinuria 29 for peripheral neuropathy 105 for amputation 09 for myocardial infarction 05 for stroke and 05 for infections the annual predicted percentage increment in complication rates from baseline at the end of 45-day lockdown due to covid19 pandemic was 45 for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy 48 for proliferative diabetic retinopathy 24 for retinal photocoagulation 151 for microalbuminuria 47 for overt proteinuria 171 for peripheral neuropathy 48 for amputation 14 for myocardial infarction 08 for stroke and 09 for infectionsin this first of the kind analysis we show substantial increase in hba1c and diabetes-related complications in people with diabetes while these data are estimates based on some assumptions numbers generated are good enough to alert us to strengthen already challenged healthcare resources toward this high-risk populationachieving and maintaining good glycemic control defined as an hba1c 70 is one of the primary requirements to reduce diabetes related complications 1314 it is also important to take into consideration that while the whole world is struggling to contain this deadly viral illness focus on the co-morbidities facilitating the viral-related morbidities and mortality cannot be compromised there is sufficient evidence to indicate that poor glycemic control and presence of organ dysfunction predisposes an individual infected with covid19 to far greater risk of mortality than those without hence it is of paramount importance to achieve as well as maintain good glycemic control for short as well as long term benefits during this pandemicone of the most worrisome factors is restriction to routine physician consultations as a result patients suffering from chronic diseases although stable are not offered the usual standards of care not only physicians but also the para-medical staff numbers are reduced and channelized toward dedicated covid19-related care as a result non-covid related complications rate are expected to rise which independently predispose these patients to acquire covid19 infectionthis analysis was therefore designed to deduce the adverse impact of a total lockdown on glycemic targets and associated complications this is likely to be the first study to make such a deduction in the absence of any prior data on the same a simulation model was created from the natural and unnatural disasters we faced in the past based on the simulation a model was created to predict the adverse impact of covid19 related lockdown on diabetes and related complications there was a moderate correlation between the post-disaster hba1c and the duration of the disaster r  048 and a strong correlation with the baseline hba1c r  081 based on this result a multivariate regression analysis was done revealing a very strong model to predict the post-lockdown hba1c depending on the duration in days of the lockdown assuming a uniform baseline hba1c derived from the diabcare study which is the latest epidemiological database on diabetes and its complications in india the post-lockdown hba1c increases from baseline as the duration of lockdown got extended example- hba1c of 226 with a 30 days lockdown to 368 with 90 days lockdown in addition this increment in hba1c permitted us to calculate the annual proportional increase in diabetes-related complications rate which increased as the duration of lockdown increasedto prevent the increase in hba1c and associateddiabetes-related complications a system must be put in place to facilitate patent doctor interface through telecommunication online consultations use of social media platforms which can bring the whole medical care at home in a virtual sense dedicated campaigns can be launched utilizing the audio-visual media encouraging lifestyle modifications at home further government must put required mechanism to prevent shortages of medicines and insulinsone of the main limitations of this study is the non-availability of diabetes-related outcomes in a lockdown this was replicated by bringing in a scenario natural  non-natural disasters which is similar to but not the same to as may occur in a lockdown clearly there are a lot of differences between a lockdown and a hurricane earthquake or a tsunamithe disasters that we have taken for analysis have occurred several years before gulf war was 29 years ago since then information flow and modes of virtual consultations have increased and may help patients control their diabetes better further information flow availability of physicians and drugs and resources varied in different countries and may be in general better now than previously these factors may lead to overestimation of risk in our model however the limited availability of resources needed to manage diabetes being a bridging factor made us choose disasters as a prior for the analysis finally any model-based prediction has its problem related to over-estimating the risk profilethe principle strength of this analysis is the robustness of the multivariate regression model it was both robust and statistically significant secondly in the absence of any previous data available on a lockdown related situation this was the case best scenario which could have been created in spite of all the limitationsthis is probably the first analysis to predict the adverse effect of a total lockdown on glycemic targets as well as diabetes-related complications we demonstrated an incremental increase in both hba1c as well as diabetes-related complications with the increase in the duration of lockdown days a pre-planned strategy must be put in place to prevent such a scenario as poorly controlled diabetes is an independent risk factor of mortality from covid19nonenone to declarediabetes mellitus is associated with a more severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and higher mortality 1 data obtained from 21 hospitals in wuhan china showed that 25 of the reported covid-19 fatalities had a history of diabetes mellitus 1 a literature search was performed using pubmed to review the interrelationships between hyperglycemia renin-angiotensin system ras and covid-19 and the effects of antihyperglycemic medications herein we discuss the roles of the classic and non-classic renin-angiotensin system ras in lung injury and glucose homeostasis among patients with covid-19 we also discuss the putative roles of glucose-lowering medications in type 2 diabetic patients with covid-19 and introduce the current evidence for their use in hospitalized patientsthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 receptor to enter the host cell and the serine protease tmprss2 for virus spike protein priming 2 the binding of sars-cov-1 spike protein to ace2 activates disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 adam17 and induces ace2 shedding via a process tightly coupled with tnf- production 3 down-regulation of ace2 cell surface expression in lung tissue is associated with a severe clinical outcome in cases of sars-cov-1 infection 4 considering that sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 share 70 sequence in the spike protein 5 sarscov2 is likely to downregulate the ace2 expression recently monteil v et al showed that human recombinant soluble ace2 significantly blocks sars-cov-2 infections providing a rationale that soluble ace2 might not only protect from lung injury but also block the sars-cov-2 from entering target cells 6ace2 is expressed in the lung kidney pancreas and other tissues and degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 7 the ace2 receptor protects against lung injury by modulating of the ras and decreasing angiotensin ii levels 8 moreover activation of the angiotensin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7ace2 axis inhibits reactive oxygen species production downregulates proinflammatory cytokine secretion and has immunomodulatory tissue-protective features 9 from a physiologic standpoint while increased baseline ace2 expression could potentially increase sars-cov-2 infectivity upregulation of ace2 expression and ace2 replacement in the acute respiratory distress syndrome phase ards phase may turn out to be beneficialaccumulating evidence supports the protective roles of ace2 in diabetes ace2 might play several roles in glucose homeostasis1ace2 deficiency leads to altered glucose metabolism ace2-knockout mice showed a -cell defect associated with a decrease in insulin secretion in a manner that is not dependent on angiotensin ii but may reflect the collectrin-like action of ace2 10 in mice ace2 overexpression in the pancreas significantly improved glucose tolerance enhanced islet function and increased -cell proliferation and insulin content 112loss of ace2 increases insulin resistance in the high-calorie diet fed mice by reduction of glut4 and administration of angiotensin-17 improved insulin tolerance suggesting a significant role of angiotensin-17 in glucose homeostasis 123hyperglycemia stimulates tissue ras and vice versa that is increased activity of angiotensin ii signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and its complications 1314 ace2 is thought to act as a compensatory mechanism for hyperglycemia-induced ras activation loss of ace2 in mice disrupts the balance of the ras in a diabetic state and leads to an angiotensin iiat1 receptor-dependent systolic dysfunction and impaired vascular function 15
adam17 is involved in the shedding of transmembrane ace2 to release the catalytically active ectodomain into the circulation 16 adam17-mediated ectodomain shedding might compromise the ras compensatory axis by impairing ace2 enzymatic activity or its ability to process angiotensin ii on the cell surface 16 in mice hyperglycemia increases adam17 activity and renal ace2 shedding into the urine 17 this urinary ace2 excretion correlated positively with the progression of diabetic renal injury probably resembling an unopposed angiotensin ii effect in humans urinary ace2 levels are significantly higher in insulin-resistant subjects and type 2 diabetes mellitus than in controls with normal glucose tolerance 18 in addition urinary ace2 appears to be positively associated with inflammatory cytokines resembling increased ace2 shedding 184the localization of ace2 expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that sars coronavirus enters islets using ace2 as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes in fact yang j et al reported that 50 of sars patients who had no previous history of diabetes or steroid treatment have been diagnosed with diabetes during hospitalization and only 10 had diabetes after 3 years of follow-up 19
it can be hypothesized that sars-cov-2-mediated downregulation of ace2 expression in the pancreas and peripheral tissues may decrease insulin secretion increase insulin resistance and induce hyperglycemia-induced ras activation on the other hand ace2 expression in the pancreas might facilitate sars-cov-2 invasion and direct -cell damageadam17 activation by sarscov2 might also increase the risk of hyperglycemia in mice accumulating evidence suggests that increased adam17 activity results in increased insulin resistance and hyperglycemia 20 adam17 plays a potential role in inflammation as it can cleave and thereby activate a variety of cytokines and cytokine receptors including tumor necrosis factor  tnf and the interleukin-6 receptor il-6r 21 increased inflammation might also contribute to the development of islet -cell failure 22 accumulating evidence suggests that patients with severe covid-19 and ards might have a cytokine storm syndrome including high levels of il-6 and tnf 23 meanwhile ras activation can propagate acute lung injury 24hyperglycemia is commonly observed during acute and critical illness early administration of insulin in acute illness is associated with better outcomes and lower mortality rates 25insulin therapy in diabetic patients with covid-19 disease that warrant hospital care might be associated with better outcomes and here are the explanations1insulin exerts immunomodulatory effects independent of glycemic control several studies suggest a potential benefit of insulin therapy in different animal models of acute lung injury and ards insulin inhibits synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors including tnf and il-6 and attenuates oxidative stress seen in acute lung injury 26272treating hyperglycemia with insulin might restore ace2 and adam17 expression and the ras balance as was shown in mice in the akita mouse model of type 1 diabetes insulin treatment normalized hyperglycemia decreased urinary ace2 excretion restored renal ace2 and adam17 expression to physiological levels and normalized the rate of shedding 28 a recent study has demonstrated a marked serum and pulmonary alterations in the ace activity of non-obese diabetic nod mice in the lung of nod mice ace activity was increased and the ace2ace activity ratio was decreased as compared to control mice interestingly insulin significantly increased ace2ace activity ratio in the mice lung and restored ace and ace2 and ace2ace ratio activities in serum samples 29 therefore it can be hypothesized that by restoring ace2 expression to physiological levels on the cell surface and decreasing angiotensin ii levels insulin therapy might prevent the rapid propagation toward cytokine storm and lung injury in covid-193early insulin therapy reduces the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar states taking into account that some diabetic patients with covid-19 may deteriorate rapidly to acute lung injury and ards
other antihyperglycemic medications table 1
 might have a protective role in covid-19-induced lung injury1metformin by inhibiting mitochondrial complex i could be useful in reducing oxidative stress and lung injury 30 however metformin should be withheld in hospitalized and critically ill patients because of the increased risk of lactic acidosis 312peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- ppar- agonists attenuated lipopolysaccharide lps-induced lung injury in murine models 32 of note in type 2 diabetic mice the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone normalized hyperglycemia attenuated renal injury and decreased urinary ace2 excretion and renal adam17 protein expression but unlike insulin did not affect renal ace2 expression 33 on the other hand pioglitazone upregulated ace2 protein expression in liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in rats with high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 34 an elevated ace2 expression in insulin-sensitive tissues can attenuate the angiotensin ii-induced insulin resistance pioglitazone effect on ace2 expression in the lung is unknown however taking into consideration the risk of fluid retention it is advisable to withhold ppar- agonists in acutely ill patients3dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 inhibitors attenuated lps-induced lung injury in mice models and may have some anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects on cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells in vitro 35 nevertheless the available evidence does not support clinically meaningful alterations in immune response after administration of dpp4 inhibitors to human subjects 36 previous study findings have shown that dpp4 serves as the functional receptor for the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 37 however unlike mers-cov the sars-cov-2 does not utilize dpp4 for cell entry and dpp4 inhibition per se seems not to exert direct antiviral effects a prospective phase iv clinical trial will assess the effect of dpp4 inhibitor linagliptin in glucose control and reducing the severity of the covid-19 infection clinicaltrialsgov nct04341935 384glucagon-like peptide 1 glp-1 agonists attenuated lps-induced lung injury in murine models 39 interestingly the glp-1 agonist liraglutide provoked an increase in ace2 expression in the lungs of both diabetic and control rats and in the circulating angiotensin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in diabetic animals 40 based on these findings it might be proposed that glp-1 agonist therapy might exert protective effects against sars-cov-2 induced lung injury5there is some emerging evidence suggesting anti-inflammatory effect of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors sglt2 inhibitors 41 however recently published treatment recommendations advise to withhold these agents during covid-19 illness due to the increased risk of dehydration and development of diabetic ketoacidosis dka 42 anyhow a prospective phase iii clinical study dare-19 is ongoing to assess the potential effect of dapagliflozin in reducing the risk of serious complications and organ failure in hospitalized patients with covid-19 illness clinicaltrialsgov nct04350593 436the sulfonylurea glibenclamide can alleviate acute lung injury by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 nlrp3 inflammasome signaling pathway 44 glibenclamide downregulates proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species and suppresses migration of inflammatory cells 45 however the use of sulfonylureas in the inpatient setting is discouraged because of the potential risk of hypoglycemia 46
in summary the current evidence reveals considerable interrelationships between hyperglycemia and coronavirus-induced lung injury insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury given the wide clinical spectrum of covid-19 and the fact that patients needing hospital care may deteriorate rapidly it is reasonable to consider the early introduction of insulin upon admission to the hospital the suggested target glucose range is 140180 mgdl 78100 mmoll in most cases 47 although considerable evidence supports the use of incretin-based therapies in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia more prospective studies comparing these agents with insulin are required to establish their efficacy and safety 4849 other antihyperglycemic agents lack safety data concerning their use in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe covid-19 pneumonia future studies should be carried out to elucidate the interface between diabetes and covid-19 and unveil glycemic and extra-glycemic effects of glucose-lowering medications in this diseasean had the idea for this paper an  ns collected the data an drafted the manuscript both authors read and approved the final submitted paper after revisionthe authors have no conflicts of interestthe high prevalence of diabetes globally makes it a frequent comorbidity in patients with coronavirus-associated disease 2019 covid-19 though diabetes increases the risk of infection in general most studies have reported prevalence of diabetes almost similar to that in general population in patients with covid-19 a meta-analysis of eight trials in china showed that diabetes was present in 8 of 46248 patients with covid-19 1 understandably prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 varies by region age and ethnicity it is not known whether patients with diabetes with well-controlled blood glucose levels have an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov-2patients with diabetes who develop covid-19 have been seen to have a worse prognosis and increased mortality in most studies in 201 chinese patients with diabetes a hazard ratio of 234 95 ci 135405 p  0002 for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 2 has been reported further meta-analysis of nine studies from china n  1936 showed a significant correlation between severity of covid-19 and diabetes or 267 95 ci 191374 p  001 3 similarly case fatality rate was 73 in patients with diabetes as opposed to 23 in those without diabetes in a report of 44672 patients of covid-19 by chinese centre for disease control 4 a recent study in 1122 patients with covid-19 in 88 centres across the usa found diabetes to be associated with more than fourfold increase in mortality 5how diabetes increases severity of covid-19 is unclear though several factors may be responsible table 1 poor glycaemic control impairs several aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections and to the potential secondary bacterial infection in the lungs 6 7 defects in immunity namely inappropriate t-cell action impaired natural killer cell activity and defects in complement action could reduce viral clearance 8 interestingly ards in patients with covid-19 is driven by severe hypoxaemia despite relatively well-preserved lung mechanics pre-existing proinflammatory state could accentuate the cytokine storm which is believed to be responsible for ards as well as multi-organ dysfunction in covid-19 9 in this context it is important to note that there is strong association between type 2 diabetes obesity and abnormal secretion of adipokines and cytokines like tnf-alfa and interferon which may further impair immunity and predispose to severe infection 10 further diabetes is associated with increased plasminogen levels which has been postulated to increase the virulence of sars cov-2 11 presence of these inflammation and prothrombotic factors has been shown in a study in 174 patients hospitalised with covid-19 in wuhan china significantly higher serum levels of interleukein 6 erythrocyte sedimentation rate creactive protein ferritin fibrinogen and ddimer were reported in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes 12 increased viral replication in diabetes may also due to an increase in furin which is a type1 membranebound protease involved in the entry of coronaviruses into the cell 13 in addition pre-existing comorbidities associated with diabetes like hypertension coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease further worsen the prognosis lastly hypoglycaemia which could occur during treatment of diabetes may additionally worsen the clinical outcomesin this respect role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in pathogenesis of covid-19 in patients with diabetes is intriguing sars cov-2 enters the cell by binding to ace2 a process which involves many steps and several enzymes and proteins 14 there is experimental evidence for downregulation of ace2 in diabetes 15 which may predispose to more severe lung injury on the other hand ace2 is a receptor for sars cov-2 and this downregulation might reduce the entry of virus into cells these issues are further discussed below in context of use of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypertensive drugsthe precise effect of treatment with various oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents on the severity of covid-19 is not known though there are some theoretical considerations metformin has shown modest benefits in lower respiratory tract infections and pulmonary tuberculosis 16 though gastrointestinal tolerability in sick patients is of concern thiazolidinediones have been shown to increase ace2 levels 17 however propensity of thiazolidinediones to cause fluid retention and the risk of congestive heart failure in covid-19 would make these agents unfavourable for treatment glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have has been shown to increase ace2 and increase surfactant in experimental animals 18 practical significance of changes in ace2 levels with use of thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists is not known sulfonylureas are effective but the risk of hypoglycaemia especially in the setting of irregular meals might preclude their use nevertheless sulfonylureas can be considered whenever blood glucose monitoring is possiblethere is some data regarding use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 inhibitors from previous viral epidemics dpp4 is the prime receptor for middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus responsible for its entry into cell 19 hence the possibility of dpp4 facilitating the entry of sars cov-2 into the cell cannot be ruled out in that context it is an interesting postulation that widespread use of dpp4 inhibitors in india and many other countries might be protecting individuals with diabetes from this infection on the other hand dpp4 inhibitors can potentially interfere with immune response which may be harmful but clinical data from dpp4 inhibitors has shown that this is generally not the case 20there is increasing use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 sglt-2 inhibitors worldwide and in india interestingly sglt-2 inhibitors could also activate ace2 indirectly especially if used along with ace inhibitors 21 there is a hypothetical possibility of sglt-2 inhibitors reducing lactate production because of reduction in oxygen demand of tissues which could reduce viral entry by raising cytosolic ph 22 further caution about dehydration and the possibility of euglycaemic ketoacidosis need to be observed when using sglt-2 inhibitors in sick patients with covid-19 insulin has also been shown to increase ace2 expression by attenuating the effect of a disintegrin and metalloprotease adam-17 23 practical relevance of these findings is not known at present in any case insulin remains the agent of choice to control sugars in hospitalised patients with covid-19 this however necessitates frequent monitoring of blood glucose and poses some practical concerns in terms of increasing the exposure of healthcare provider to the covid-19 patient strategies like single dose of basal insulin and self-monitoring of glucose by patients are worth considering in that context further technologies like remote continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump could be usefulthus it appears safe to continue the usual anti-hyperglycemic medications in most patients who have mild infection good general condition and normal oral intake however sglt-2 inhibitors might need discontinuation due to the risk of dehydration and euglycaemic ketoacidosis metformin may also need to be stopped if there is vomiting or poor oral intake doses of other anti-hyperglyacemic drugs like sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucose levels hospitalised patients especially those requiring intensive care would need insulin for glycaemic controlthese are commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes especially in those with hypertension and kidney dysfunction there have been a lot of literature and debate whether these drugs could benefit or harm patients having covid-19 infection this issue is discussed belowthere has been a lot of interest in ace inhibitors and arbs following the identification of ace2 as the receptor for sars cov-2 ace inhibitors and arbs increase the levels of ace2 by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 increased ace2 expression could theoretically increase viral binding and entry into cell though there is no clinical evidence to support this otherwise attractive hypothesis reduced angiotensin 2 as a result of ace inhibition and increased angiotensin 17 as a result of increased activity of ace2 could reduce the cytosolic ph which could result in more favourable environment for viral endocytosis 24 also angiotensin 17 has been shown to increase sympathetic activity by acting on mas receptors in the brainstem which could contribute to cardiovascular morbidity observed in these patients 25 however most of these concerns are hypothetical with minimal evidenceincreased ace2 might not result in increased viral entry because of the limited availability of the serine protease tmprss2 which is required for viral binding 20 increased ace2 and consequently angiotensin 17 have vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects and have been shown to be protective against lung injury in animals 26 treatment with arbs was reported to reduce mortality in ebola virus infection 27 previously a small study in ten patients with ards showed that recombinant ace2 was well tolerated and led to an increase in angiotensin 17 levels 28
there are no controlled studies on the use of ace inhibitors and arbs in patients with covid-19the clinical evidence is inconclusive while one study in china did not find any association of ace inhibitor use with severity of disease there was an increased mortality in patients with covid-19 receiving ace inhibitors and arbs in another study 29 30 one study in the usa did not find any significant difference in mortality in patients who received ace inhibitors and arbs and those who did not 31 a recently published study in 1128 patients hospitalised with covid-19 in nine hospitals in hubei china showed significantly reduced all-cause mortality with the use of ace inhibitors or arbs compared with other anti-hypertensive drugs 32many patients with covid-19 have shown hypokalemia indicating activation of ras 33 and ace inhibitors and arbs may have a role 34
in this subject situation is far from clear and there are too many unknown factors which might be operative in the interaction between ace2 diabetes ace inhibitorsarbs and lung injury the lack of evidence for either benefit or harm has prompted european society of cardiology council on hypertension european society of hypertension and american heart association to advise continuing with ace inhibitors and arbs in case a patient develops covid-19 35 a clinical trial is underway to study the arb losartan and recombinant human ace2 in patients with covid-19there have been several commentaries on the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 36 however several unanswered questions remain about which the knowledge and information is limited clearly further research could lead to important insights table 2 some of these are discussed belowwhat is the natural history of covid-19 in patients with diabetes the natural course of the disease after infection of patients with diabetes with sars cov-2 has not been documented well for example we dont know if the incubation period is different in people with diabetes it is also possible those patients of diabetes who are young have short duration of diabetes and well controlled may have less severe covid-19 infection there is a possibility of reduced viral clearance in diabetes as has been reported in patients who are on corticosteroids 37 this could have public health implications as the patients with diabetes could remain infectious for a longer period than those without diabetesuse of drugs in treatment of covid-19 which could have effect on glycaemia chloroquine has also been licensed for use in india for patients with type 2 diabetes although the efficacy of chloroquine is not proven it has been used in patients with covid-19 38 chloroquine has a weak anti-hyperglycaemic effect and there is a theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic drugscorticosteroids though neither effective nor recommended are frequently used in ards and sepsis and would worsen glycemic levelscovid-19 and pancreatic beta cells there is significant expression of ace2 receptors in pancreatic islets and hyperglycaemia lasting up to 3 years has been reported in patients with sars 39 direct injury to beta cells is a possibility and patients recovering from covid-19 might need major changes in anti-hyperglycaemic regimen recently new-onset diabetes has been reported in patients with covid-19 11suboptimal lifestyle measures and other issues during lockdownthere are restrictions on movement of people and lockdowns in several parts of the world in order to contain the pandemic this poses some challenges in the evaluation and treatment of patients with diabetes there are limited opportunities for exercise as regular walks and visits to gyms or swimming pools are not possible dietary irregularity could occur because of staying at homethere is considerable mental stress because of the unpredictability of the disease as well as social immobility as brought out in an excellent study in healthy people in china at the time when there was a huge burden of covid-19 there 40patients may find it difficult to procure healthy foods medicines insulin needles and glucose strips etc because of partial or complete lockdowns the problem becomes more pronounced with elderly poor and disadvantaged sections of societythere could be underreporting of symptoms because of the perceived need to avoid visiting hospitalsall these factors could cause glucose dysregulation and could predispose patients to complications like infections hyperosmolar coma ketoacidosis and even acute cardiac events a prediction model of the effect of lockdown in india on blood glucose showed a 36 increase in hba1c at the end of 45 days of lockdown and future increase in diabetes-related complications 41use of remote education and advice telemedicine also emails texts can be very helpful in these times to impart education and has been shown to improve glycaemia telemedicine guidelines for physicians in india have been published 42 patients need to be educated about the need to visit the hospital urgently in emergency situations like vomiting drowsiness shortness of breath chest pain weakness of limbs altered sensorium etc 43covid-19 testing for all patients with diabetes given the increased severity of covid-19 in patients with diabetes a case could be made for testing of all people with diabetes for the presence of disease that would be a humongous task considering the high prevalence of diabetes high-risk groups like those with high hba1c those with comorbidities long duration of diabetes or elderly could be chosen for testing however utility of this approach remains to be proven there are frequent false negative tests and repeated testing may be required in asymptomatic individuals since there is no treatment currently recommended for asymptomatic people therefore apart from isolating them detecting these patients might not prove meaningful clinicallyethnic variations in severity of covi19 in patients with diabetes in the united states the disease has caused disproportionately more fatalities in blacks and asians compared with whites 44 south asia africa and korea have seen much lower mortality than rest of the world whether it is because of the different approaches topublic health measures innate immunity or due to some ethnicity-specific variability in response to viral infection or availability of good medical resources remains to be studied interactions between ethnicity diabetes and severity of covid-19 will be of interest considering the racial disparities in the prevalence of diabetes according to a recent report prevalence of covid-19 and mortality due to the disease correlated significantly with frequency of d allele in ace gene 45 such polymorphisms in ace gene as well as several other genes involved in the pathophysiology of covid-19 might be responsible for individual and ethnic variations in disease coursebenefits of lockdown there could be some positive effects of the social restrictionspatients have more time for self-care and could pay more attention to diet and exercise if motivatedsome people have stopped or reduced alcohol and smoking because of non-availabilitythere has been significant fall in air pollution as a result of reduced industrial and vehicular emissions 46 increase in blood glucose has been reported with short-term rise in pm10 particulate matter 10 microns in diameter and glycaemic improvement could occur with the fall in pollution 47in view of the issues highlighted above it is important to recognise the importance of diabetes as a vital comorbidity in patients with covid-19 there are several contentious issues and the ongoing research will hopefully shed more light on the behaviour of covid-19 in patients with diabetesin december 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 started in wuhan china 1 the world health organization declared the covid-19 pandemic on march 11 2020 until now 2020 may 17 a total of about 45 million confirmed cases with 300000 deaths have been reported worldwide and the number of new confirmed cases has not yet been reduced 2 in february 2020 a covid-19 outbreak began in daegu korea and about 11000 confirmed cases with 263 deaths have been reported fortunately the spread of covid-19 has been well controlled in korea 3in this article entitled acute hyperglycemic crises with coronavirus disease-19 case reports kim et al 4 reported two cases with serious acute diabetes complications precipitated by covid-19 in daegu diabetes especially poorly controlled is associated with an increased risk of infection and adverse outcomes 5 based on recent reports from china and italy the prevalence of diabetes among covid-19 confirmed cases was similar in each country 6 however recent studies reported patients with severe covid-19 disease were older and had more comorbidities ie diabetes cancer and cardiovascular disease 78 diabetes is indeed associated with increased serious covid-19 presentation and mortality after adjusting for other potential risk factors 9 this means diabetes seems to have an effect on severe coronavirus disease the treatment process and poor outcomes rather than on patient susceptibility to covid-19 infection in this regard covid-19 in poorly controlled diabetes patients is thought to cause acute serious diabetic complications however to the best of my knowledge there are few reports regarding the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis and an hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state in patients with covid-19 therefore this study is valuable because it describes these cases in detail including diagnosis the treatment process and outcomesin my opinion it would be better to describe the outcome of the follow-up treatment in the second patient case in addition the medication history for each patient including glucose-lowering drugs anti-hypertensive drugs and cholesterol-lowering drugs before admission and during covid-19 treatment needs to be added to this study angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is known as a cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 10 several medications used mainly for patients with diabetes such as insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 thiazolidinediones ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers and statins are reported to affect ace2 expression and the level of angiotensin ii 11 although data on how these drugs influence covid-19 are lacking it is recommended to share the authors opinion on the effects of the drugs used on diabetes patients severe presentation and prognosislastly i would like to express my gratitude and tribute to the medical staff in daegu who have worked hard and dedicated themselves to public health during the covid-19 outbreakcovid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 a disease caused by the coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 has emerged as a rapidly spreading communicable disease affecting more than 100 countries across the globe at present the disease is primarily spread through large respiratory droplets though the possibility of other routes of transmission cannot be ruled out as the virus has been found in stool and urine of affected individuals 1 the disease severity has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia respiratory failure and death there are regional variations in the mortality rates and these estimates are rapidly changing as more data are becoming available there were 95333 confirmed cases of covid-19 worldwide with a mortality rate of 34 according to the situation report of world health organisation on march 5 2020 2 however a much lower mortality of 14 has been reported in analysis of data of 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland china 3 considering that the number of unreported and unconfirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the reported cases the actual mortality may be less than 1 which is similar to that of severe seasonal influenza 4 india has 39confirmed cases till 10th march 2020 and contact surveillance of these cases is going on the understanding of epidemiological characteristics of this infection is evolving on a daily basis as the disease is spreading to different parts of the globeindividuals with diabetes are at risk of infections especially influenza and pneumonia this risk can be reduced though not completely eliminated by good glycaemic control all people with diabetes above 2 years of age are recommended pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccinations not only this patients with diabetes have a severe disease when infected with respiratory viruses indeed diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza a 2009 h1n1 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus merscov 5 6 7data about covid-19 in patients with diabetes is limited at present diabetes was present in 423 of 26 fatalities due to covid-19 in wuhan china 8 in a study in 140 patients with covid-19 in wuhan china diabetes was not a risk factor for severe disease course 9 however another study in 150 patients 68 deaths and 82 recovered patients in wuhan showed that the number of co-morbidities to be a significant predictor of mortality 10 analysis of 11 studies regarding laboratory abnormalities in patients with covid-19 did not mention raised blood glucose or diabetes as predictor of severe disease 11 notwithstanding these small series a report of 72314 cases of covid-19 published by chinese centre for disease control and prevention showed increased mortality in people with diabetes 23 overall and 73 patients with diabetes 12our knowledge about the prevalence of covid-19 and disease course in people with diabetes will evolve as more detailed analyses are carried out for now it is reasonable to assume that people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing infection with sars-cov-2 coexisting heart disease kidney disease advanced age and frailty are likely to have further increase in the severity of diseasefollowing measures are suggested for prevention of this disease in patients with diabetesaspecific measures in patients with diabetesait is important that people with diabetes maintain a good glycaemic control as it might help in reducing the risk of infection and also the severity more frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels with use of self-monitoring blood glucose is required good glycemic control may lessen chances of superadded bacterial pneumonia as wellbpatients with diabetes and co-existing heart disease or kidney disease need special care and attempts should be made to stabilise their cardiacrenal statuscattention to nutrition and adequate protein intake is important any deficiencies of minerals and vitamins need to be taken care ofdexercise has been shown to improve immunity though it might be prudent to be careful and avoid crowded places like gymnasia or swimming poolseit is important to take influenza and pneumonia vaccinations the latter may decrease chances of secondary bacterial pneumonia after respiratory viral infection however data in present viral epidemic is not available
bgeneral preventive measuresathorough handwashing with soap and water should be encouraged since it kills the virus use of alcohol-based hand rubs is also usefulbthere is a need to practise proper respiratory hygiene with covering of mouth and nose with bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing touching of mouth nose and eyes should be avoidedccontact with an affected person needs to be minimised use of recommended face masks is advised if there is a contact with someone with respiratory symptomsdnon-essential travel to major affected areas should be avoided in order to restrict the spread of infection


ain case a person with diabetes develops fever cough running nose or dyspnoea the appropriate health authority needs to be notified as testing for this disease is available at selected places onlybthe affected person needs to be isolated for 14 days or till the symptoms resolve whichever is longercountry-specific guidelines need to be followedcmajority of patients have a mild disease and can be managed at home hydration should be maintained and symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen steam inhalation etc can be givendpatients with type 1 diabetes should measure blood glucose and urinary ketones frequently if fever with hyperglycemia occurs frequent changes in dosage and correctional bolus may be required to maintain normoglycemiaeanti-hyperglycemic agents that can cause volume depletion or hypoglycemia should be avoided dosage of oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be reduced patients should follow sick day guidelines and may need more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and drug adjustmentfhospitalised patients with severe disease need frequent blood glucose monitoring oral agents especially metformin and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors need to be stoppedginsulin is the preferred agent for control of hyperglycemia in hospitalised sick patients
in the absence of a specific antiviral drug anecdotal use of drugs like lopinavir ritonavir interferon-1 rna polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and chloroquine has been reported 2019-ncov receptor binding site has a strong affinity with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and inhibitors of the rennin angiotensin system may have a role in treating severe respiratory disease 1314 zinc nanoparticles were shown to have inhibitory effects on h1n1 viral load though their effect in covid-19 is unknown and untested 15 vitamin c supplementation has some role in prevention of pneumonia and its effect on covid-19 needs evaluation 16 efforts to develop a vaccine are underway which will be a major tool to contain this epidemic 17the first case of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 was reported in wuhan hubei province china on december 31 2019 until march coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused by this virus has spread around the world sarscov2 is human coronavirus which does not belong to the group of benign coronaviruses that cause common cold but to the smaller group of coronaviruses that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirussars and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirusmers

 investigations on the outcome of these patients are scarce and data are very limited nevertheless hypertension is considered as one of the most important risk factors for covid19 the relationship between hypertension and adverse outcome is still questionablethe aim of this review paper was to summarize current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and covid19 and the role of hypertension in outcome of these patients a comprehensive search was performed on pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar to find review papers on this topic published until may 1 2020sarscov2 infection is triggered when the sprotein of the virus binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is highly expressed in the heart lungs kidney and gastrointestinal tract and plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways
20
 sarscov2 binds to ace2 with much higher affinity compared to sarscov
21
 additionally sarscov2 shows its pathogenic activity by attacking type ii alveolar epithelial cells that are expressing ace2 previous studies of coronavirus that causes sars demonstrated that this virus binds to ace2 in pulmonary alveoli through their superficial spike proteins which causes lung damage and even lung function failure
21

the loss of ace2 caused by binding sarscov2 may shift the system to an overall higher angiotensin ii and lower angiotensin17 tone the role of angiotensin ii in covid19 hypertensive patients seems to be crucial due to its role in functioning of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas that promotes vasoconstriction sodium retention oxidative stress inflammation and fibrosis and increases the bioactive peptide angiotensin17
22

epidemiological data coming from china indicate that arterial hypertension cardiovascular diseases diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most prevalent concomitant diseases in patients with covid19

 it has still been debated whether hypertension was a predictor of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors age obesity diabetes and comorbidities coronary artery disease heart failure atrial fibrillation cerebrovascular disease renal impairmentthe prevalence of hypertension among patients with covid19 between different studies ranged from 1520

 which might be the most important reason for different prevalence of hypertensive patients among studies advanced age was associated with higher prevalence of other comorbidities such as diabetes renal impairment arterial hypertension and obesity which altogether increased proportion of hypertensive patients

the prevalence of overweight and obesity was not reported in available studies about covid19 this circulus vitiosus between hypertension obesity and diabetes is difficult to break and therefore conclusion cannot be made without detailed data of all links of chain the impact of smoking should not be forgotten in the relation between copd hypertension and higher propensity to covid19

 however results are conflicting but majority of authors did not find higher prevalence of smoking in patients with adverse outcome

9
 the level of renal damage cannot be excluded as one of contribute factor for higher percentage of hypertension and advance stage of covid19 in hypertensive patients most of studies reported the large prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in covid19 patients but they also did not classified them and therefore it is difficult to estimate the individual effect of coronary artery disease heart failure and atrial fibrillation on occurrence and severity of covid19li et al summarized the findings from 6 studies and showed that the prevalence of hypertension cardio and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with covid19 was 171 164 and 97 respectively
17
 the incidences of hypertension cardiocerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were two to threefolds higher in patients with severe type of covid19 than in their nonsevere counterparts yang et al included 46248 covid19 patients from 8 studies and reported that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and respiratory system disease
18
 the most frequent comorbidities in severe patients were hypertension respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease the large metaanalysis that included 76993 patients with covid19 found that the pooled prevalence of hypertension cardiovascular disease smoking history and diabetes was 1637 1211 763 and 787 respectively 
19
 table 1 the authors of metaanalyses agreed about the large heterogeneity between studies which obviously limited the quality of their study this can be partly explained by different designs and large variation in sample size among studies
18
 
19

some essential data are still missing and it would be dangerous to ascribe the large portion of risk for sarscov2 infection or severity of covid19 to any risk factor including hypertension it would be reasonable to hypothesize that uncontrolled comorbidities as well as combination of concomitant diseases may increase the risk of infection and severity of covid19 but this has to be examinedthere are many controversies about the effect of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb in covid19 patients
24
 some authors expressed their concern that the use of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors and variation in ace2 expression may be partly responsible for sarscov2 virulence
25
 
26
 populationbased studies estimated that only small proportion of hypertensive patients in china 30 to 40 is treated with antihypertensive therapy and raas inhibitors are used in only 25 to 30 of treated patients
27
 
28
 therefore it can be anticipated that only small percentage of covid19 patients in china were actually treated with acei or arbon the other hand the prevalence of cardiac damage in covid19 patients is not negligible and it is associated with adverse outcome in these subjects
5
 
6
 data regarding the frequency of heart failure in covid19 patients are scarce and the same is valid for chronic kidney disease from therapeutic point of view acei and arb have important roles in treatment of these conditionscardiac injury heart failure and renal impairment particularly with albuminuria therefore withdrawing raas inhibitors or switching medications would have uncertain benefits but very certain disadvantagesit would be expected that problem with raas inhibitors would escalate in western countries europe and usa where patients are taking antihypertensive medications and particularly raas inhibitors in significantly higher percentage than in china however studies from italy and usa did not show any association between raas inhibitors and susceptibility to coronavirus complications or mortality from covid19
29
 
30
 
31
 even new investigation from china confirmed these findings
32
 the switching from the raas inhibitors to another antihypertensive therapy would lead to insufficient blood pressure control which could induce more complications in covid19 patients than infection of sarscov2 itself novel data showed that raas inhibitors could even improve the outcome of hypertensive patients with covid19
33
 the authors hypothesized that raas inhibitors have an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses
31
 based on the available data despite some theoretical possibilities multiple specialty societies recommended that covid19 patients should continue therapy with raas inhibitors
34
 
35
 
36

limited number of studies provided outcome data after a short followup therefore one should be careful in interpretation of these findings guan et al demonstrated that patients with severe covid19 and those with primary end point admission in intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death had significantly higher percentage of hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd chronic renal disease and cancer
3
 the authors did not investigate the relationship between different demographic and clinical parameters with severity of disease or the outcomeshi et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd and cancer were more prevalent in the patients with myocardial injury diagnosed by elevation of highsensitivity troponin i and creatinine kinasemyocardial band ckmb
5
 cardiac injury was associated with significantly higher mortality 521 vs 45 the authors did not investigate which comorbidities were associated with cardiac injury and mortality it must be noted that patients with cardiac injury were significantly older guo et al demonstrated similar results when compared covid19 patients with and without elevation of troponin and found that 278 of patients with covid19 had cardiac injury
6
 in this study chronic renal dysfunction and usage of raas were also more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury however patients with cardiac injury were almost 20 years older and more frequently men than those without injury which also have to be taken into account it was also reported that underlying cardiovascular disease was worsening outcome only in patients with myocardial injury
6
 defining myocardial injury only by elevation of troponin i in these circumstances could be questionable because this biomarker may be increased in many conditions such as inflammation andor sepsissystemic inflammatory response syndrome and kidney injury the authors did not clearly stated which disorders were included under the term cardiovascular disease and it is not clear whether hypertension was included in this term furthermore it is difficult to understand which cardiomyopathies were included and whether patients with heart failure were includedchen et al reported that hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes were more prevalent among covid19 patients who died in comparison with survivors
7
 however there was a large difference in age and sex distribution between groups and authors did not investigate the effect of comorbidities on outcome in this population
7
 table 2 zhou et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease chronic renal disease and copd were more frequent among nonsurvivors than in survivors
9
 the authors found that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease were predictors of mortality in covid19 patients nevertheless none of these comorbidities remained significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age sex and smoking status these findings confirmed the importance of comprehensive risk assessment by including all relevant risk factors and comorbiditiesin the large original study that included 1590 patients guan et al showed that after adjusting for age and smoking status patients with copd diabetes hypertension and malignancy were more likely to reach the composite end points admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death than those without
12
 malignancy copd hypertension and diabetes increased the risk of adverse outcome for 35 27 157 and 158fold respectively
12
 patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly higher risk of the composite end point than patients with a single comorbidity stratification of patients according to their age 65 years vs 65 years did not show significant difference in the strength of associations between the number of comorbidities and mortality of covid19
12
 however it cannot be excluded that other confounding factors besides aging and smoking might also be responsible for the association between comorbidities and outcome it would be also helpful to divide primary outcome into two separate outcomes a admission to intensive care unit andor invasive ventilation and b death this would provide separated information about independent predictors of severity and mortality of covid19 this was performed in the small study and authors found that hypertension and diabetes were predictors of acute respiratory distress syndrome but not mortality in covid19 patients
16
 unfortunately multivariable analysis with adjustment for relevant confounding factors was not performed in this investigationthere are a number of limitations in the mentioned investigations the selfreporting of comorbidities on hospital admission represents one of them underreporting of comorbidities due to the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing could interfere the associations between comorbidities and clinical outcome more importantly the duration of followup was short and some patients remained in the hospital at the time of publishing these studies which means that real outcome was unknown obesity was not reported in available studies and its influence could not be investigated furthermore only one study reported basal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure which would help to estimate the percentage of uncontrolled hypertension the same refers to prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes the most of studies included small number of patients which is additional obstacle one should not forget the fact that majority of studies come from china and we should be cautious when extrapolating these findings to other countries with outbreak of covid19 studies should consider all potential sources of bias and confounding which is why additional investigations with improved design are warrantedrecent findings reported that arterial hypertension represented one of the most common comorbidities in patients with covid19 this prevalence ranged between 10 and 34 the impact of hypertension on outcome and particularly on mortality in covid19 patients is not clear due to lack of data studies did not provide evidence that raas inhibitors should be avoided or switched in these patients large studies that will consider all potential sources of bias and confounding factors as well as longer followup are necessary the public pressure to find all answers is very high but physicians duty is to stay rational and has scientific approach to available and upcoming datasevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infected more than 35 million people in the world and was the cause of more than 250 thousand deaths in nearly 6 months dec-may - data updated on 5th may 1 this virus belongs to nidovirales order coronaviridae family orthocoronavirinae subfamily and according to its genomic characteristics was classified in the betacoronavirus genus it is an enveloped virus with a single strand positive-sense rna genome with a length of around 298 kb and a gc content of 38 2 3 scanning electron microscopy images showed a 60-140 m round or elliptic virus with frequently pleomorphic shape and distinctive spikes about 8 to 12 nm in length 4 according to genomic sequencing sars-cov-2 shares 89 homology with bat sars-like-covzxc21 82 with human sars-cov and around 50 with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2 as all the other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 comprises the four structural proteins e envelope protein m membrane protein n nucleocapsid protein and s spike protein as well as eight accessory proteins 5 the spike surface glycoprotein plays an essential role by promoting the attachment of the virus to its receptor on host cells and may determine its host tropism and transmission ability receptor-binding domain rbd of s-protein from sars-cov-2 shares identical 3d structure with the rbd of s-protein from sars-cov as well as 7647 amino acid sequence homology 6 in vitro and in vivo studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the cellular receptor for sars-cov virus 7 8 the novel sars-cov-2 also binds to ace2 2 9 10 11 with 10 to 20 times higher affinity than sars-cov does 12 in addition sars-cov-2 employs the cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 for s protein priming allowing internalization and replication in the host cells 11ace2 is a naturally occurring enzyme abundantly present in humans mainly in the cell membrane of lung alveolar epithelial cells 13 14 15 16 and enterocytes of the small intestine 15 which provide as entry routes for the sarscov infection and probably sars-cov-2 additionally ace2 is also expressed by arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells 15 cholangiocytes 17 testis 13 14 pancreas 18 19 in cardiovascular 13 14 16 renal 13 14 16 urothelial 16 mucosal 20 and gastrointestinal tissues 16 21 in minor extentace2 is homologous to the firstly discovered ace1 and both enzymes are part of the renin-angiotensin system ras which has a crucial role in regulating blood pressure maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis for its potent vasoconstrictorvasodepressor actions 22 ras is an enzymatic cascade starting with the cleavage of angiotensinogen by renin to form angiotensin ang i this peptide is then further metabolized by ace1 which removes two amino acids at the c-terminal end to form the potent vasopressor peptide ang ii 23 ang ii levels are endogenously regulated by the ace2 which is a membrane-bound mono-carboxypeptidase that cleaves the terminal leucine and phenylalanine residues from ang i and ang ii originating ang 19 and ang 17 respectively the hexapeptide ang 17 exerts a potent vasodilator anti-fibrotic anti-proliferation and anti-inflammatory effect via activation of its mas receptor its effects counterbalance the ace1-ang ii-atr1 system 24on a similar manner ace1 inhibitor drugs aceis have an antihypertensive effect and substantially lower the risk of death heart failure and stroke 25 patients with hypertension and diabetes benefit from the use of these drugs since not only ace2 is insensitive to blockade by ace1 inhibitors but also the use of these inhibitor drugs increases the ace2 gene expression and activity probably due to an accumulation of ang i 26 ace2 has been found to have protective effects against lung injury in different lung injury animal models 8 27 28 specifically in diabetes ace2 seems to have a protective role in the progression of cardiovascular and renal complications and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for the management of diabetes and its complications 29 30 studies in mice showed the role of ace2 in the improvement of glycemia levels in mice with diabetes by direct effects in the pancreas 19 improving insulin sensitivity and glucose-mediated insulin release 31 and reduction of the risk of type 2 diabetes development 32the effect of diabetes in the expression of ace2 is not well established studies in animal models of diabetes evidenced either an increased or reduced expression of ace2 in renal tissues and pancreatic tissues depending on the disease stage on contrary the levels of ace2 in lung tissue of mice with diabetes seem to be lower when compared to renal and pancreatic tissues 29 33 similarly a study in non-obese diabetic nod mouse model showed an increase of ace2 in serum liver and pancreas but not in the lung 34 a study performed in 2012 by soro-paavonen et al showed increased serum ace2 activity in type 1 diabetes mellitus dm patients with vascular complications but not in those without complications 35it has been found that aceis and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs cause an overexpression of ace2 in patients treated with these drugs 26 in the study of soro-paavonen patients treated with aceis had increased ace2 activity independently of the presence of vascular complications 35 however the expression of ace2 mrna was not measured expression levels of ace2 have been associated with susceptibility to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in different cell lines 7 36 37 therefore raising the concern that patients being treated with aceis or arbs could be at higher risk of infection and of associated morbidity and mortality after a sars-cov-2 infection due to a higher expression of the virus entry gate in target tissues 38 nevertheless conflicting information has been found on this topic and some data suggest that aceis and arbs can have protective effects against lung injury 39 with relatively few clinical studies on this matter when compared to the pre-clinical studies in animal models it may be erroneous to admit that the effects of ras inhibitors on ace2 expression are translatable to human physiology additionally the measurements of ace2 plasma levels performed in most studies may not be a reliable indicator of ace2 activity since the full length protein is predominantly membrane bound 39 taking advantage of ace2 sars-cov-2 gains access to the cells however it has been shown that soon after infection ace2 expression is rapidly downregulated 8 whether this effect is caused by the virus to prevent ace2 protective effects 28 or results from an indirect mechanism is not yet clear it has been confirmed in some clinical studies that the long-term use of aceis or arbs by patients is not associated with an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection neither of developing severe covid-19 or even with a higher risk of in-hospital death 40 41 42 all these studies highlight that the withdrawal of these medications is not recommended to prevent serious covid-19 since these have well-known benefits in protecting the kidney and myocardium 39 with the clinical decompensation caused by its removal potentially causing a more serious condition than the viral infectionthe multi-organ damage is characteristic of sars nevertheless the major affected organs include the lungs heart and kidney the severity of disease progression and death predictor factors include old age thrombocytopenia severe hypoxia and hyperglycemia 43 hyperglycemia can also be a consequence of the sars-cov infection due to the ace2-dependent damage of pancreatic islets and exocrine tissue as islet damage elevation on fasting plasma glucose levels and diabetes development during hospitalization have all been reported 43 although the pancreas damage was transient to most patients in some cases diabetes remained after 3-years follow-up 43 in the case of sars-cov-2 the same transient damage in the pancreas has already been documented 44 and given its higher infectivity and affinity for the ace2 receptor there is increased concern relative to the complications caused by hyperglycemia as well as the long-term effects of the infection on recovered patientshyperglycemia is characteristic of diabetes when this chronic metabolic disorder is left untreated which leads to serious complications ranging from limb amputations kidney failure blindness or cardiovascular disease 45 46 this disorder may be caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas resistance to insulin action or a mixture of both 46 therefore as hyperglycemia underlies many of the complications developed in the disease course a tight control of glucose blood levels in patients with diabetes is essentialsince the beginning of covid-19 outbreak diabetes has been reported as one of the high-risk factors for rapid disease progression and bad prognosis of covid-19 47 for instance a retrospective cohort study with 191 chinese patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed that 48 of the patients had a comorbidity with diabetes representing 19 of those patients 48 another study showed that among 26 deaths due to sars-cov-2 in wuhan 423 had diabetes 49 also a different cohort study analyzing 201 patients from wuhan with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia revealed that 109 of the patients had diabetes they also observed that among the patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 418 from the total cohort more patients had comorbidities than those who did not develop ards being diabetes the second most frequent comorbidity 190 in ards-patients versus 51 in non-ards patients 50 furthermore the largest case series of covid-19 in china reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention showed that dm patients had higher mortality rates 73 when compared to overall population 23 in a total of 72314 analyzed cases 51 this comes as no surprise as it is reported that people with diabetes demonstrate higher susceptibility to several infectious diseases such as tuberculosis pneumonia or influenza 52 the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood and depend on the type of infection but some hypotheses have been raised some possible explanations for dm being a high-risk factor for covid-19 may be due to hyperglycemic environment which is known to increase the virulence of some pathogens besides it was also reported that phagocytosis and chemotaxis are impaired the production of interleukins in response to infection is reduced as well as the response of t cells and neutrophils 52 53 overall the immune response which is vital to fight against covid-19 infection is impaired especially in diabetic patients with poor blood glucose controlfurthermore several studies have shown that dm patients have a significant decrease in forced vital capacity fvc and forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 which are important indicators of lung function this impaired pulmonary function was significantly associated with poorly controlled diabetes and consequently hyperglycemic levels 54 55 56 therefore this reduced pulmonary capacity may also increase susceptibility to respiratory infections possibly representing another factor in the myriad of events that might increase the vulnerability of dm patients towards covid-19in the absence of a specific antiviral drug physicians are considering and trying lopinavir ritonavir interferon-1b rna polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and tamiflu that were already reported for other diseases 57 inclusively zinc oxide nanoparticles have also been considered since they were shown to have inhibitory effects on h1n1 viral load 58 plus vitamin c is also a good supplement for the immune system and has some preventive effects on pneumonia 59 however none of these have shown yet evidences of being beneficial for covid-19as mentioned it is suggested that therapeutics for diabetes and hypertension namely aceis and arbs are responsible for upregulating ace2 on the other hand this is the functional receptor that sars-cov-2 uses as cellular entry 9 in this sense some authors hypothesize that these therapeutics may contribute for the increased infection and advice to discontinue aceis and arbs used in patients with diabetes or hypertension however there is no clear evidence in animals nor humans confirming this theory besides ace2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen as well as exercise and dehydration plus it was very recently published a chinese study showing that transplantation of ace2-mesenchymal stem cells improves the outcome of patients with covid-19 pneumonia 60 some studies have actually already shown that overexpressed ace2 plays a protective role in the lungs with sars-cov-2 infection suggesting arbs and aceis as therapy 61 62 as proof in a preclinical study authors injected animals with the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov to cause a severe lung injury and verified that ace2 is significantly downregulated after treating them with arb losartan the severe acute lung injury was attenuated 8 this evidence was supported by findings from china where they showed that ace2 blockade resulted in exacerbated lung damage and reduced animal survival after respiratory syncytial virus infection 28 actually there is a comment from an israel author published in early march proposing arbs and aceis as a treatment for patients with covid-19 infection to reduce the risk or severity of viral pneumonia 63 however when the coronavirus spike protein binds to ace2 there is a downregulation of ace2 which leads to an excessive accumulation of angiotensin ii vasoconstrictor pulmonary inflammation fibrosis edema and less ace2 to convert it to angiotensin 1-7 vasodilator anti-proliferative cytoprotective the big question here is to know who wins this battle the virus that binds to ace2 which is upregulated in lungs or the protective effects caused by the ace2 upregulation and this is not clarified yet in this sense european medicines agency ema recommend that treatment with arbs and aceis should be maintained in patients with diabetes and hypertension 64 patients who stop taking them may face more complications regarding kidney failure and increased mortality either way as an alternative treatment calcium channel blockers ccbs can be used since they seem not to increase ace2 expression and activity 65commonly and according to standard procedure very sick patients should stop taking metformin and sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors due to their adverse side effects as acidosis and fat metabolism 66 in addition the glucagon-like peptide receptor1 analogues can also be stopped since they may cause nausea vomiting and pioglitazone among other side effects described elsewhere 67 plus aromatase inhibitors should also be stopped since they reduce insulin sensitivity and insulin should be the only one used in acutely sick patients or with severe breathing disorders 68 only when recovered or stabilized noninsulin therapy can be introducedknowing that the virus infection is a multistep process there are some possible targets to treat covid-19 a strong candidate that could exert a potent antiviral effect is the anti-malaria chloroquine it is described that the virus processing and internalization is facilitated by low ph and ph-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins 69 chloroquine becomes entrapped in membrane-enclosed low ph organelles and is rapidly protonated and concentrated in endosomes interfering with their acidification hydroxychloroquine has been then considered for short-term treatment trials 70 the antiviral activity of chloroquine combined with azithromycin against covid-19 in vitro was recently reported however the authors found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of this combination for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 either way ongoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety 71 also amiodarone has the ability to interfere with the endocytic pathway being suggested as a possible inhibitor of the sars coronavirus 72 after binding to ace2 the virus requires the essential serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming so using tmprss2 inhibitors eg camostat mesylate already used to treat cancer and hepatitis can be a possible or adjuvant therapy 73according to ema the potential treatments that are in clinical trials are remdesivir investigational lopinavirritonavir anti-hiv chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine anti-malaria and rheumatoid arthritis systemic interferons as interferon beta multiple sclerosis and monoclonal antibodies with activity against components of the immune system 74 plus all the diagnostics treatments and vaccines considered for covid-19 are summed up in artis ventures platform 75overall the chance of developing serious complications due to sars-cov-2 infection is higher in people with more health conditions associated as discussed above diabetes and all the complications associated with this disease such as weakened immune response or hyperglycemia present a higher risk for infected patients figure 1
 not only for the covid-19 progression but also as a higher risk to develop secondary infections and therefore worsening of the health state for those reasons an effective and tight management of diabetes specifically of glucose plasma levels is extremely important in infected patients with diabetes additionally while the use of aceis and arbs in sars-cov-2 infected patients has raised some questions regarding their beneficial or harmful effects on disease progression there is not enough evidence yet that allows drawing conclusions on this issue therefore while care must be taken in the use of these drugs their abrupt withdrawal is not recommended as it could lead to even more serious complications several strategies are being tested to control the covid-19 pandemic and a better understanding of the sars-cov-2 effects on high-risk patients is fundamental to decrease the morbidities and mortalitycoronaviruses are a single-stranded enveloped rna virus belonging to the coronaviridae family beta genus type have a diameter of 60140 nm known to cause respiratory infections in human 1 2 at the end of 2019 china has experienced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that killed more than a thousand and infected over 7000 individuals within the first 50 days and later spread rapidly all over the world 3 at that time initially it was named novel coronavirus 2019 2019-ncov by the chinese center for disease control and prevention which was further renamed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 by the world health organization who and the disease caused by this sars-cov-2 named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by who 4 it has around 70 similar genetic sequence with 20022003 pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 5 fever dry cough and fatigue are identified as the common symptoms of the infections as well as prolonged prothrombin time and lymphopenia are identified as common characteristics of the infections 6 the transmission route for covid-19 to humans is through bat and the intermediate host for transmission is still under research 6 as the virus used an intermediate host to acquire a series of genetic mutations to infect humans effectively 4 the local transmission of covid-19 occurred through respiratory droplets saliva feces and urine from infected individuals 4 in march 2020 the who officially declared it as a global pandemic 7 as of 21st april 2020 016 million deaths with covid-19 have been reported among 24 million confirmed cases globally 2several clinical studies have reported cardiovascular diseases cvd as the most common cause of comorbidity in patients with covid-19 also a proportion of those patients became critically ill and dead 8 besides the disease itself is associated with cvd complications 9 as cvd complications can be a significant contributor to mortality among the patient with the disease awareness of emergency clinicians becoming very vital 7 studies also reported higher risk of a diabetic individual to get infected with the sars-cov-2 virus and having other complications or may die from the disease 2in this study we tried to cover the association of covid-19 infection in individuals with cvd dm and their related complications associated with covid-19 infectionsevere symptoms of covid-19 are more common in patients with pre-existing cvd when became infected therefore a large proportion of deaths from covid-19 have resulted among those patients 10 a meta-analysis of 1527 patients with covid-19 showed that patients with cardiac disease 164 and hypertension 171 were more likely to require intensive care 7 another study conducted on 44672 patients with covid-19 showed that fatality rate is nearly five-fold higher in patients with pre-existing cvd compared to patients without cvd 105 vs 23 7 in a study on 191 patients from wuhan china 48 of patients had comorbidity 67 died 30 of which had hypertension 48 died and 8 of them had cvd 13 died 11 similar findings had been suggested by other studies that high risk of mortality in patients with pre-existing cvd 6 810 studies reported that patients with hypertension and cvd have higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 which could be a potential reason for enhancing susceptibility of those patients to sars-cov-2 a possible mechanistic pathway of severity between covid-19 and cvd fig 1 9 alongside patients with cvd are more likely to have hypercoagulability due to increase level of d-dimer which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism therefore hypoxia and heart failure 8 also in patients with the acute coronary syndrome acs reduced cardiac function has been observed leading to myocardial ischemia which might act as a factor to worsen the condition of patients with covid-19 and may lead to death 10angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a membrane-bound aminopeptidase identified as a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 10 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 and those trigger the infection which is highly expressed in lungs and heart 10 the angiotensin ii converted from angiotensin i by ace responsible for vasoconstriction increased blood pressure and vascular remodeling clinical observation revealed significant elevation of plasma angiotensin ii in a patient with covid-19 which suggests that binding of covid-19 to ace2 causes a release of excessive angiotensin ii through the renin-angiotensin system ras increasing heart loading cardio-myocyte hypertrophy and high blood pressure 1 invasion of the virus to the lung surface cells and cardio-myocytes causes inflammation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il 16 tumor necrosis factor interferon endothelial adhesive factor granulocytes colony-stimulating factor chemoattractant protein 1 by the over-activating immune response of the body and increased apoptosis of myocardial cells which enhance the risk of cardiovascular events 1 besides the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines the myocardial dysfunction could be caused by severe lung failure because of the infection and reduced the amount of oxygen supply or hypoxemia 12a study performed on 53-year-old white women without any previous history of cvd admitted to hospital with covid-19 infection and found to have severe left ventricular dysfunction 3 increased levels of cardiac troponin were observed in that patient which is identified as a sensitive marker for myocardial injury and the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging mri analysis showed to have diffuse edema and acute myocarditis moreover the study suggests that the onset of symptoms a couple of days after influenza-like syndrome indicates potential myocyte dissemination of the virus therefore the onset of heart failure 3 association between covid-19 infection and the myocardial injury was first reported in wuhan china in a study of 41 patients with the disease among which 12 of patients had a high sensitivity troponin i above the threshold of 28 pgml 7 according to the report of the national health commission of china in patients who died from covid-19 118 of them were without prior cvd furthermore those patients had substantial heart damage and elevated level of troponin virus infections such as influenza and parvovirus b-19 are described as one of the most common causes of myocarditis 3 though the exact mechanism behind myocardial injury induced by sars-cov-2 is not fully understood a previous report revealed the presence of the sars-cov genome in the heart of 35 of patients with the infection which raises the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus 12 as both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are highly homologous in the genome they may have the same pathophysiology some other mechanism suggests direct myocardial involvement via ace2 11 studies also report that cytokine storm in patients with covid-19 due to the imbalance between subtypes of t helper cells may contribute to myocardial injury 12a study reported that heart failure is an initial presentation of covid-19 in 23 of patients with cardiomyopathy in 33 of patients 7 according to another study 24 of patients had heart failure and nearly half of those patients did not have any known history of cvd or hypertension as heart failure could occur due to exacerbation of prior left ventricular dysfunction the occurrence of new cardiomyopathy in those patients remains unclear 9due to excessive inflammation immobilization and diffuse intravascular coagulation dic covid-19 may lead to venous thromboembolism 13 studies revealed significant abnormalities in the coagulation pathway in patients with covid-19 along with elevated d-dimer 7 a study performed on 184 intensive care unit icu patients with covid-19 pneumonia where those patients received a standard dose of thromboprophylaxis despite regular systemic thrombosis prophylaxis 31 of those patients have thrombotic complications which are remarkably high and 27 of them have confirmed venous thromboembolic event vte 13 a study suggests that anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin may reduce mortality in patients with severe covid-19 infection 7cardiac arrhythmia is another cardiovascular complication in patients with covid-19 infection 9 a study revealed the presence of cardiac arrhythmias in 17 of hospitalized and 44 of icu patients infected with covid-19 7 however a high prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias may arise from hypoxia abnormal metabolism neuro-hormonal or inflammatory stress induced by covid-19 infectionindividuals having dm are more susceptible to infections especially influenza and pneumonia therefore pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccination has been recommended for individuals with diabetes above 2 years of age 16 this is because of their compromised immune system particularly the innate immunity 17 also innate immunity may be affected temporarily by transient hyperglycemia in response to infection numerous factors such as hyperglycemia altered production of cytokine impaired t cell-mediated immune response inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis ineffective microbial clearance and phagocytic cell dysfunction may contribute to immune dysfunction in diabetic individuals a possible mechanistic pathway of severity between covid-19 and dm fig 2 18 the hypothesis suggests that ace2 may play a vital role in the severity of covid-19 infection in diabetic individuals as the virus utilize ace2 for invading into host pneumocytes 17 and ace2 is also expressed in pancreatic tissue 18 alongside individuals with diabetes have been shown to have elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine especially il-1 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- and different markers such as c- reactive protein d-dimer and fibrinogen those may further prolong the cytokine storms and lead to severe illness in diabetic individuals with covid-19 infection the role of the markers in covid-19 is to induce dm fig 3 17significant increase in infection and replication of influenza virus after pulmonary endothelial cells being exposed to elevated concentration of glucose in vitro indicating increased viral replication in hyperglycemic condition therefore hyperglycemia may also play a role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of respiratory viral diseases though further study needed to conclude this matter 14 elevated levels of glucose may also suppress the immune response against the virus according to experimental data glycemic control can be beneficial clinically in patients who are having both diabetes and respiratory viral infection like covid-19 14the sars-cov-2 virus attaches to the ace2 enzyme at low cytosolic ph and invades into the cell leading infection 19 angiotensin ii has a strong role in ph alkalizing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs reduce the levels of angiotensin ii and cause low cytosolic ph 19 therefore diabetes patients who are treated with acei and arbs have shown to have elevated expression of ace2 and those people have a higher chance to develop severe and fetal covid-19 infection 20 a study reported hypoglycemia in a 26-year-old patient with type 1 diabetes after being treated with chloroquine phosphate 500 mg for 4 consecutive weeks 21 the use of chloroquine is very frequent in covid-19-infected patients therefore the infected patients with type 1 diabetes should be monitored closely as hypoglycemia could be associated with the increased risk of mortality in those patients a previous study on sars-cov patients without previous diabetes demonstrated pancreatic damage in 5128 of patients leading to acute type 1 diabetes mellitus during hospitalization 14 this may also be possible in patients with covid-19 infection though further evidence is required to conclude this alongside dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 is shown to be the primary receptor of mers-cov and there is a chance that the dpp-4 receptor may act as a receptor for covid-19 infection which is important to explore as dpp-4 inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus 14both the individuals with prior cvd and diabetes are at higher risk to develop severe covid-19 infection alongside development of cvd complications mostly myocardial injury cardiomyopathy venous thromboembolism and cardiac arrhythmias among the individuals without prior cvd is also an emerging concern in diabetic individuals there are some medications such as acei arbs chloroquine and dpp-4 inhibitors using issues that also arise as some study predicts their use could worsen the conditions of the patients with covid-19 which call for the careful use of those medications in diabetic individuals with the infection lastly as the number of infections increasing day by day it is quite predictable to increase the number of those complicated cases as well therefore medical professional needs to be aware and prepare for managing those emergencies effectivelythe clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 ranges from asymptomatic presentation or mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and death due to sepsis and septic shock 1 although the most commonly reported are flu-like symptoms with fever fatigue headache sore throat coughing and dyspnea a gastrointestinal symptomatology can be frequently encountered in clinical practice representing the covid-19 patients chief complaint in some cases 2 in addition progressive and diffuse vascular derangement represents a major threat in severe covid-19 presentation with histological evidence of endothelial inflammation congestion and thrombosis in several internal organs including the heart kidneys lungs liver and intestines 3 postmortem studies have underlined luminal and mural fibrin deposition in pulmonary septal capillaries and a disseminated microvascular injury reminiscent of other thrombotic microangiopathies but with distinct features 45 in addition consistent with an inflammation-induced procoagulant shift of endothelial cells the clinical course of covid-19 can be occasionally worsened by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism 5 based on current available evidence patients with diabetes are expected to have enhanced disease severity and an increased risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit icu with respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction following sars-cov-2 infection 16 when compared with patients who did not receive icu care a larger fraction of icu patients with covid-19 were found to have underlying diabetes 222 vs 59 presumably type 2 t2d 1 these preliminary observations from hubei the chinese province where the outbreak began have also been recently corroborated by the lombardy intensive care unit icu network which found t2d as the fourth most common comorbidity among 1591 critically ill patients admitted to the icu with covid-19 180 patients 17 after the spread of the epidemic in northern italy and across europe 7 even more relevant one-third of covid-19 patients dying in italy have t2d 8 congruous with the independent association of this condition with fatal complications during two other coronavirus-related respiratory infection epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 1given the extremely high global prevalence of diabetes affecting more than 450 million adults worldwide and still on the rise in accordance with the last international diabetes federation idf atlas 9 the covid-19 pandemic represents a serious threat to a large vulnerable population so that intensive supportive care plus optimum pharmacological management are critical to address the clinical course of covid-19 and prevent fatal outcomes herein we provide a brief narrative overview of mechanisms potential benefits and safety issues of novel classes of antidiabetic drugs during the covid-19 crisis with a focus on infectious outcomesdipeptidyl-peptidase 4 dpp4 inhibitors also known as gliptins represent a relatively new class of oral antidiabetic agents that block the inactivation of the distal gut-derived insulinotropic hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 glp1 by positively affecting glucose control with minimal risk of hypoglycemia these drugs have gained popularity as a second-line option for managing t2d due to their favorable side effect profile and competitive costs 10 to date there are five dpp4 inhibitors available on the european market including sitagliptin saxagliptin linagliptin alogliptin and vildagliptin all of which have specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties with potentially relevant implications for patients affected by liver or kidney disease notwithstanding comparable glycemic efficacy and inhibition of dpp4 activity 11 according to mechanistic studies dpp4 formerly known as t-cell antigen cd26 is a multifunctional soluble and cell-bound serine protease abundantly expressed in lymphocytes and adipocytes as well as in many other cell types including endothelial and epithelial cells which plays critical roles in the modulation of glucose homeostasis and inflammatory responses 10 interestingly dpp4 was identified as a functional receptor for human coronavirus-erasmus medical center hcov-emc 12 the virus responsible for mers and genetically close to sars-cov-2 in addition antibodies directed against dpp4 could impair hcov-emc infection in primary human bronchial epithelial cells 12 the observation that the s1 domain of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein interacts with the host receptor protein dpp4 1314 raised the hypothesis that sars-cov-2 may use dpp4 as a further functional receptor to gain entry into the host in addition to the well-documented angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 15 although a direct involvement of dpp4 in the modulation of sars-cov-2 entry has been denied in a stably transfected human embryonic 293t cell line 16 this computational evidence 13 has raised speculation and questions about whether targeting one of the potential host determinants of virulence with dpp4 inhibitors would be useful in attenuating covid-19 infection after viral exposure 1718 especially in patients with t2d typically depicted by a pathogenic dysregulation of dpp4 expression 19 apart from the anti-hyperglycemic effect related to protease-dependent modulation of the entero-insular axis dpp4 inhibitors possess unique immunomodulatory therapeutic potential for autoimmune and rheumatological disorders 2021 cancer 22 and most remarkably mers 23 targeting dpp4 to inflect natural viral dynamics has been thus suggested as a pharmacologically reasonable strategy in the case of covid-19 as well as other severe respiratory diseases related to coronaviruses 1723 interestingly rheumatological disorders and severe covid-19 share the overproduction of nf-kb-dependent proinflammatory cytokines and mediators such as il-1 il-6 and tnf- as a common key pathogenetic mechanism 2425 the blockade of il-6 receptors with tocilizumab a humanized igg1 monoclonal antibody commonly used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is currently under investigation in patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia whereas inhibition of il-1 release by hydroxychloroquine a first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug dmard therapy is under investigation in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 to prevent disease progression wwwaifagovit in addition to its immunomodulant and anti-inflammatory effects hydroxychloroquine can interfere with the glycosylation of sars-cov-2 spike proteins and ace2 receptors blocking in in vitro experimental models viral entry 26 so that its empiric prophylactic use among patients and healthcare workers at high risk of infection has been recently advocated by the indian council of medical research httpsicmrnicincontentcovid-19 it is also noteworthy that during infection progression sars-cov-2 decreases the activity and expression of ace2 27 the primary component of an alternate renin-angiotensin system ras that counteracts angiotensin ii angii the unbalanced angii activity has been indicated as a critical driver for severe covid-19 manifestations in lungs and other organs 28 in this regard dpp4 inhibitors could interfere with the ras system and reduce angii levels thereby ameliorating hypertension and comorbid cardiac remodeling in experimental animal models 29 however despite a plausible pharmacological rationale validation of drugs with originally different therapeutic indications for preventing or treating covid-19 can be challenging even in the case of dpp4 inhibitors as current computational or preclinical evidence does not suffice to date may 2020 neither data are available regarding clinical and demographic characteristics of people with diabetes developing severe covid-19 complications nor do we know whether background glycemic levels or antidiabetic therapies might have a role epidemiological and experimental clinical research programs are comprehensibly more difficult during a pandemic because of many possible barriers including risk of infection for healthcare workers and research staff deployment to provide clinical care 30 a metanalysis evidenced that treatment with dpp4 inhibitors does not increase the overall risk of respiratory infections with respect to placebo or conventional oral antidiabetic comparators metformin sulfonylureas thiazolidinediones or 098 95 ci 091 to 105 although no subgroup analysis has been performed concerning relationships with specific viral pathogens 31 more recently a large prospective cohort study in france evidenced an inverse association between diabetes and non-influenza respiratory virus illnesses over the course of three flu seasons 32 the study ended before the covid-19 pandemic however hospitalized patients with flu-like symptoms who tested positive for non-influenza respiratory viruses including coronavirus 229e were less likely to have diabetes than patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses 18 vs 25 unfortunately background information on medication use was not assessed in this study except for immunosuppressive drugs 32 therefore whether specific antidiabetic medications would have prevented non-influenza respiratory virus-related hospitalization in patients with diabetes remains uncertain interestingly and regardless of the viral strain coronavirus infections are counteracted by submucosal mast cells of the respiratory tract as the forefront part of the innate immunity response 33 endothelial transmigration of mast cells is under the control of the stromal derived factor 1 sdf-1 which is cleaved and inactivated by dpp4 3435 because of its dose-dependent ability to selectively induce the production of il-8 but not other pro-inflammatory mediators from mast cells sdf-1 orchestrates leukocyte recruitment and vascular remodeling in the context of arteriogenesis both of which could be boosted by dpp4 blockage in experimental animal models 3436 in addition increased plasmatic levels of sdf-1 have been associated with maturation and migration of leukocytes to mucosal compartments and immune response-dependent abortion of human immunodeficiency virus 1 hiv1 infection 37 an intriguing question that could be raised is whether dpp4 inhibitor-related augmentation of sdf-1 levels and mast cells in mucosal entry sites would confer resistance against sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses in this regard some evidence suggests that while neutralizing these pathogens mast cells release antiviral and cytotoxic mediators which in some circumstances can aggravate the clinical course of the disease 33 the dual effects of mast cells in viral infections could introduce further arguments and controversies in the debate about the use of dpp4 inhibitors as a potential protective strategy against severe covid-19 manifestations 38 while downregulation and inhibition of dpp4 activity by mers and hiv1 have been demonstrated 38 to date there is no indication that binding of sars-cov-2 would lead to similar effects in addition concerning covid-19 related vascular damage it should be noted that in contrast to preclinical evidence human studies have shown either a neutral 39 or a detrimental 40 effect of dpp4 blockage on endothelial function in the setting of diabetes figure 1 summarizes the potential benefits and harms of dpp4 inhibitors on covid-19 outcomessodium-glucose cotransporter 2 sglt2 inhibitors also known as gliflozins are the last class of antidiabetic drugs approved by the us food and drugs and european regulatory agencies fda and ema respectively for the treatment of t2d 41 four sglt2 inhibitors are currently available on the european market namely canagliflozin dapagliflozin empagliflozin and ertugliflozin with comparable glycemic efficacy despite differences in terms of selectivity toward sglt2 42 concerning their pharmacological mechanism of action sglt2 inhibitors suppress renal glucose reabsorption and enhance urinary glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner being therefore suitable for patients with a marked decline in -cell function because of autoimmune and inflammatory processes including pancreatitis cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis thereby allowing off-label prescriptions in common practice 4143 clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have drawn attention to the increased risk of genitourinary infections and volume depletion accompanying the use of sglt2 inhibitors in the presence of diabetes 41 yet it is of the utmost significance in the time of this covid-19 pandemic the exceptional risk of diabetic ketoacidosis dka associated with sglt2 inhibitors among vulnerable patient categories such as long-standing t2d patients with marked -cell insufficiency or patients with autoimmune diabetes during an intercurrent illness 44 dka a potentially life-threatening metabolic complication of diabetes may occur as a consequence of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and is typically characterized by hyperglycemia 250 mgdl generally 350800 mgdl ketosis plasma -hydroxybutyrate 42110 mmoll and acidosis ph  73 45 when related to sglt2 inhibition dka may be even more deceitful with an euglycemic presentation 250 mgdl because of an increased urinary loss of glucose that mitigates hyperglycemia 45 very recently the fda raised a warning about real-world off-label use of sglt2 inhibitors among patients with autoimmune diabetes given its association with a dka incidence rate of 73100 person-years 26-fold higher than what would be expected based on clinical trial data with a peak of about 197100 person-years in young adult women 2244 years of age 44 the extremely high dka incidence in young women with autoimmune diabetes may be related to distorted eating attitudes and behaviors anxiety about body weight and size and lower adherence toward insulin replacement therapy frequently observed in this particular population 46 however it should be noted that this sexual dimorphism also exists for the genitourinary side effects of sglt2 inhibitors 41 which represent potential precipitating factors for dka along with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections such as covid-19 47 severe covid-19 outcomes including lethality appear less frequent in women 17 probably due to sex-based immunological responses 48 although discrepancies in smoking habits 49 the prevalence of hypertension and specific multimorbidity combinations 50 in contrast with the intrinsic vulnerability of pregnancy status 51 might be no less important in light of this whether the female gender would still have a favorable impact on severe covid-19 outcomes in the presence of diabetes remains to be defined so that a gender bias could be avoided when providing medical care covid-19 may increase insulin demand and induce fever nausea and anorexia with consequent hyperketonemia which accentuates the gastrointestinal symptoms of infection in a vicious cycle metabolic decompensation toward dka either hyperglycemic or euglycemic in susceptible diabetic patients on sglt2 inhibitors can be further exacerbated by volume depletion from persistent glycosuria at initial symptoms of covid-19 illness patients with off-label prescription or long-lasting t2d with severe -cell insufficiency requiring insulin therapy should temporarily stop the sglt2 inhibitor contact their medical provider monitor capillary blood ketones and take supplemental boluses of rapid insulin along with liquids and carbohydrates a full episode of covid-19-related dka can be successfully prevented with these measures nevertheless it should be recognized that the pharmacological effects of sglt2 inhibitor treatment may persist beyond several half-lives of elimination and some patients will still require hospitalization for dka even after stopping the sglt2 inhibitor with glycosuria and ketonemia persisting for up to 910 days 52glp1 receptor agonists glp1 ras also known as incretin-mimetics provide pharmacologic levels of exogenous glp1 which analogously to the endogenous gut-derived incretin hormones improve glucose homeostasis through enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion delayed gastric emptying and increased post-meal satiety 5354 by providing an additional benefit of weight loss glp1 ras represent the preferable second-line option for patients with obesity and inadequately controlled t2d as adjunct to lifestyle interventions and metformin 55 in addition due to their claimed protective effects in cardiovascular outcome clinical trials glp1 ras and sglt2 inhibitors have been recently endorsed by the american diabetes association as the most appropriate second-line treatment for t2d patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd or a high related risk 55 years of age with coronary carotid or lower-extremity artery stenosis 50 or left ventricular hypertrophy irrespective of glycemic levels 56 to date several glp1 ras with different half-lives and pharmacokinetics properties have been licensed in europe for subcutaneous administration twice-daily exenatide once-daily liraglutide and lixisenatide and once-weekly dulaglutide albiglutide and semaglutide 57 whereas the once daily preparation of semaglutide for oral administration is forthcoming wwwemaeuropaeu similar to dpp4 inhibitors systemic anti-inflammatory effects have been associated with the use of glp1 ras in patients with t2d as a consequence of the inhibitory activity on cytokine release due to their interference with nf-kb signaling pathways 58 in animal models of sepsis administration of liraglutide has been proved to improve survival and vascular dysfunction along with inflammatory and hemostatic parameters 59 in addition given the contribution of glp1 receptors in airway remodeling 60 several clinical trials are underway to address the theoretical potential of glp1 ras for the amelioration of chronic obstructive respiratory diseases even more relevant in animal studies the glp1 ra liraglutide has been associated with the upregulation of ace2 a cell-bound protease abundantly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells enterocytes and vessels upstream of the counter-regulatory ras pathway which exerts a negative effect on inflammatory and fibrotic processes 61 although still unsupported by clear translational evidence the glp1 ras-induced upregulation of ace2 could ameliorate lung injury during covid-19 antagonizing the reduction of ace2 expression levels that are hallmarks of infection progression 1527 and preventing the over-activated immune response critical for ards 62 on the other hand ace2 enables virus entry into host target cells 141526 raising speculation of increased susceptibility to covid-19 infection in the case of ace2 overregulation as a consequence of long-term treatment with ace inhibitors andor angii receptor blockers glp1 ras or a combination of both in hypertensive patients with diabetes 15 ex vivo and in vitro demonstrations of viral particle aggregates within human kidney endothelial cells 3 and engineered blood vessel organoids 63 suggest that the sars-cov-2 virus could target the endothelium via the locally expressed surface receptor ace2 triggering a systemic vascular dysfunction that shifts vascular balance towards inflammation and hypercoagulability leading to multiorgan failure in most critical cases 364 however to date no robust clinical-epidemiological studies have been put forward concerning the correlation between these medications use and covid-19 severity adjusting for potential confounding variables such as sex age and comorbidities possibly affecting ace2 expression patterns the issue of whether treatment-induced overregulation of ace2 in target tissues would lead to an increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection or its pulmonary-protective activity would prevail has yet to be solved hence current position statements of the council of hypertension of the european society of cardiology wwwescardioorg clarify that ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers should be continued and prescribed according to previously established guidelines at the same time despite experts suggestions to reconsider diabetes management on a case-by-case basis in view of patient setting and clinical judgment 6566 no specific recommendations on the initiation and use of glp1 ras during the covid-19 pandemic have been provided to diabetes specialists on par with the abovementioned antihypertensive drugs we believe that there is no reason supported by evidence to contraindicate or vice versa overpromote glp1 ras for managing people with t2d however there is an urgent need to determine whether their use can influence the clinical course of covid-19 in this regard as it has been remarked 66 the current evidence with glp1 ras and dpp4 inhibitors in critically ill diabetic patients with covid-19 complications is inadequate to make therapeutic recommendations and insulin therapy should be safely sustained as the preferred option for managing diabetes on a different note we retain that special consideration should be also paid to the eventuality of gastrointestinal symptoms related to glp1 ras when patients recover from covid-19 nausea vomiting and diarrhea have been reported in up to 30 15 and 15 respectively of diabetic patients on glp1 ras 67 usually these gastrointestinal disorders arise during the first few weeks of treatment and are more pronounced on a background of metformin or insulin therapy 67 however while metformin can directly elicit a mild gastrointestinal intolerance the correlation with insulin therapy may underline a long-standing t2d with poor glycemic control a condition commonly associated with impaired gastric motility which may accentuate the deceleration of gastric emptying induced by exogenous glp1 ras 67 very recently a meta-analysis of 60 studies including 4243 patients with covid-19 has evidenced that anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain or discomfort are common manifestations of covid-19 especially in severe forms of infection requiring hospitalization and icu care 171 2 notwithstanding a postulated prognostic relevance gastrointestinal symptoms may also accompany the course of milder forms of covid-19 268 and appear associated with prolonged illness 68 given the sustained attenuation in appetite sensations and dietary energy intake coupled with gastrointestinal intolerance the use of glp1 ras may further delay patient recovery and a temporary suspension should be cautiously considered in the most fragile cases figure 2 summarizes the potential benefits and harms of glp1 ras on covid-19 outcomesaccording to a recent international panel of experts 69 people with diabetes who have not yet been infected with covid-19 should intensify their glycemic control as a means of primary prevention for a severe illness it is a well-known fact that poorly controlled hyperglycemia impairs the immune functions and worsens the clinical course of infections in all forms of diabetes 7071 in addition with reference to the particular case of covid-19 it has been evidenced that glycosylation of ace2 receptors a post-translational reaction that can be boosted by hyperglycemia is necessary for cell entry as ace2 alone does not suffice 72 lowering the amount of glycosylated ace2 with anti-hyperglycemic measures in diabetic patients may thus reduce the burden of sars-cov-2 infection in case of viral exposure to optimize diabetes management previously established international guidelines 5556 with relevance to specific national adaptations and reimbursement criteria for glucose-lowering drugs must be considered however when patients with diabetes develop covid-19 treatment with sglt2 inhibitors or glp1 ras should deserve careful attention on a case-by-case basis dependent on their own clinical presentation and concurrent comorbidities when these types of treatments need to be discontinued due to covid-19 the alternative choice is insulin irrespective of the patient setting 6670 table 1 reassumes the efficacy and safety concerns around novel antidiabetic drugs with special reference to covid-19 outcomeseven if current practices for treating diabetic patients infected by sars-cov-2 are no different from those of the general population special care is required for patients with diabetes given the greater risk of complications until in-hospital death furthermore some novel antidiabetic drugs such as sglt2 inhibitors and glp1 ras routinely employed in t2d management may exacerbate the clinical expression of covid-19 and thus should be stopped in the most fragile patients conversely although not univocal some evidence suggests that dpp4 inhibitors may retain the potential for preventing andor mitigating the clinical course of covid-19 considering the minimal risk upon use the relatively long experience and their easy availability worldwide dpp4 inhibitors might be taken into account for clinical use as experimental drugs however in order to justify either the overpromotion or the off-label use for this drug class reliable and unbiased observational research addressing clinical outcomes and predictors in the case of sars-cov-2 exposure is a fundamental prerequisite as no patient generalization can be applied in the setting of diabetesa new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection began to spread in wuhan china in early december 2019 and has rapidly spread around the globe the disease condition associated with this novel coronavirus is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and this outbreak was declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 by the world health organization who 1 as of may 15 2020 the outbreak had reached globally 4580498 confirmed cases and 305618 deaths and only 1735657 patients had recovered 2 these numbers are much greater than those registered during the sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers pandemics which occurred in 2003 and 2013 respectively 3 despite the fact that the covid-19 mortality rate to date is lower 2 3sars-cov-2 binds mainly to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors in host cells which are abundant in the lungs heart blood vessels and intestine and after more than a decade of research there are still no specific treatments or effective vaccines for coronavirus 3 4 5 6covid-19 presents with respiratory symptoms from mild to severe and a significant percentage of patients develop acute respiratory disease syndrome ards these severe symptoms are associated with a true cytokine storm in particular il-6 and death can be one of the outcomes 7old age and underlying morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases in particular hypertension and metabolic disorders obesity and diabetes have been identified as significant risk factors for covid-19 morbidity and mortality 7 8 9 however asthma and copd may not be common comorbidities 10 moreover the real impact of sars-cov-2 in asthma control is unclearresults from the first epidemiologic studies of the covid-19 pandemic in china apparently did not identify asthma as a risk factor of severe covid-19 10 11 of 171 children treated at wuhan childrens hospital wuhan china 3 18 required intensive care and mechanical ventilation all of them had underlying diseases but there was no asthma reference 12 the same data was found in a cross-sectional multicenter study carried out in 10 hospitals across hubei province china including hospitalized children with covid-19 13 table 1dong et al 14 china in a nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients mean age 7 years with covid-19 observed cases at the chinese center for disease control and prevention from january 16 2020 to february 8 2020 hubei province and did not report any asthma casein a survey of 140 adult patients admitted with covid-19 china the clinical characteristics and allergy status of the patients was investigated all of the patients were community-acquired cases hypertension 300 and diabetes mellitus 121 were the most common comorbidities drug hypersensitivity 114 and urticaria 14 were self-reported by several patients asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients and the authors concluded that allergic diseases and asthma were not risk factors for sars-cov-2 infection an older age and a high number of comorbidities ie cardiovascular and metabolic diseases were associated with covid-19 severity 15 the same authors studied a larger sample of 290 confirmed covid-19 adult patients who were hospitalized and they found only 1 patient with asthma 03 once again hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequently found comorbidities 16in another retrospective multicenter cohort study that included 191 adult inpatients with confirmed covid-19 wuhan china 48 had at least 1 comorbid disease with hypertension being the most common followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease with no asthma reference 17 in a survey of 70 adult patients admitted with covid-19 in tongji hospital wuhan china an asthma prevalence rate of 09 was found this is markedly lower than that in the adult population in this region 64 18 in this study asthma was not identified as a risk factor for disease severity in contrast with hypertension 18a nationwide analysis from china 19 including 1590

hospitalizationseverity in contrast with hypertension and copd in the oldest population age 65 years included in the uk biobank 38 the same tendency of asthma prevalence was found between hospitalized covid-19 patients versus controls 182 vs 130 but again asthma was not identified as an independent risk factor for severityin a report from the middle east saudi arabia39 that included 150 hospitalized adult patients mean age 461 years it was found that 288 and 260 of the covid-19 population had hypertension and diabetes respectively the asthma prevalence was 27 and 1 patient with asthma was admitted to the icuin a study aiming to estimate the risk factors for hospitalization and death in a mexican population 40 infected with sars-cov-2 n  10554 mean age 465 years 394 hospitalized and 92 fatal cases hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity found 217 followed by obesity 2015 and diabetes 177 the asthma prevalence was 36 of this population 31 in the hospitalized patients and in 32 in the fatal cases patients with hypertension obesity and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalized and die than people without these comorbidities once again asthma was not identified as an independent risk factor for hospitalization andor mortality 40based on the available literature there was no clear evidence that patients with asthma were at a higher risk of being infected or becoming severely ill with sars-cov-2 although recent reports from the usa and the uk suggest that asthma is much more common in children and adults with covid-19 than was previously reported in asia and in the first surveys in continental europenevertheless the prevalence of several underlying conditions identified in us hospitalized patients with covid-19 was similar to those for hospitalized influenza patients during influenza seasons 201415 through 201819 ie regarding chronic respiratory diseases 2931 41of particular note in the uk is the association of asthma with a higher risk of covid-19 hospital death with the hr increasing further for those who received ocs probably indicating a greater severity of disease this contrasts with previous findings in several countries where asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases have been underrepresented in hospitalized patients 36 also in the uk asthma was reported in 140 and 179 of hospitalized patients but with no increased risk of death 35 37among school age children viral infection reportedly accounts for up to 85 of asthma exacerbations and viruses are more frequently isolated from symptomatic patients than from asymptomatic patients 42 43 even though respiratory viruses are one of the most common triggers for asthma exacerbations in all age groups not all of these viruses affect patients equally in particular the human rhinovirus was identified as the main individual contributor for asthma exacerbations with coronavirus being one of the less identified triggers of asthma exacerbations in children as well as in adults 44 a recent literature review concerning virus detection during asthma exacerbations confirmed that exacerbations were mainly associated with rhinovirus infection in all continents 45in previous sars outbreaks patients with asthma in particular children appeared to be less susceptible to the coronavirus with a reported low rate of asthma exacerbations and a good prognosis on follow-up 10 46 in contrast during influenza epidemics asthma was associated with more severe disease including the need for mechanical ventilation not only in adults but also in children 47 the exact reasons for this remain unknown but it was confirmed during the current coronavirus pandemic 48from the recent covid-19 literature no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding asthma control or severity similarly no information can be extrapolated about asthma phenotypes ie regarding whether asthma is allergic or notcovid-19 outcomes vary from asymptomatic infection to death and it is possible that this clinical range reflects different airway levels of the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 and the spike protein activator transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 considering that the virus cell entry also depends on s-protein priming by host cell proteasesblood eosinophil levels are a well-known predictor of airway t2 inflammation 49 and the measurement of blood eosinophil levels can be used as an accessible not strong proxy for investigation of the association between airway t2 inflammation and covid-19 outcomesin early reports from china a detailed clinical investigation of hospitalized covid-19 cases suggested severe eosinopenia together with lymphopenia as a potential indicator of the diagnosis and to a worse prognosis including death 15 it was believed that low eosinophil counts in peripheral blood would be related to the sars-cov-2 infection itself however more recent studies from china and from italy have not reported eosinopenia in patients with severe covid-19 26 31 50although the relationship between eosinophil counts and covid-19 is uncertain attention is warranted to monitor eosinophil counts among patients with asthma who are using biological therapies that lead to decreased eosinophil counts and the clinical course of covid-19 in cases infected with the sars-cov-2 51sajuthi et al 52 studied in children the role of both t2 inflammation and viral infection in regulating the gene expression of ace2 and tmprss2 and they found a strong influence of t2 cytokine-driven inflammation on both ace2 downregulation and tmprss2 upregulation expression levels which can have clinical implications for covid-19 outcomes in contrast the authors found an equally strong positive influence of respiratory virus infections on ace2 expression 52 so at least theoretically in patients with asthma and high t2 inflammation the consequence of an interferon-dependent inflammation requires close monitoring given the enhanced risk of complications due to sars-cov-2 infectiona recent study that included asthma patients from 3 different cohorts of children and adults found that ace2 receptor expression was lower in those patients with high allergic sensitization but nonatopic asthma was not associated with this reduced expression 53 these data suggest that this reduced ace2 expression may be a potential contributor among several other factors of reduced covid-19 severity in patients with respiratory allergies ie allergic asthma 53additionally there is some early evidence coming from the severe asthma research program-3 sarp that inhaled corticosteroid therapy is also associated with reduction on ace2 and tmprss2 gene expression from sputum 54 these data stress the importance of maintain asthma controlled using the treatment according to the best practices including with inhaled steroidsthere is also evidence to support that taking ics may be beneficial in dealing coronavirus infections in vitro studies have shown inhibitory actions of budesonide on coronavirus hcov-229e replication and cytokine production 55 and preliminary not yet peer-reviewed data suggest that ciclesonide blocks sars-cov-2 ribonucleic acid replication 56 and inhibits its cytopathic activity 57 which may have clinical implicationsalthough gene expression for ace2 and tmprss2 did not differ in healthy and asthmatic patients it was also found that males african americans and patients with diabetes have increased expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in their sputum cells which may be associated with the poor prognosis of these patients when infected with the sars-cov-2 54dong et al 58 very elegantly described selected cases of patients with covid-19 children and adults demonstrating the profile complexity and different clinical presentations from mild to severe cases patients with common allergic diseases such as rhinitis or atopic dermatitis did not develop distinct symptoms or had severe courses which may suggest a positive balance of type 2 immune regulation in covid-19 pathogenesisnew data are emerging daily rapidly updating our understanding of this novel coronavirus but it is crucial that patients with asthma and other allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis maintain their controller medication from inhaled corticosteroids to biologics 51 59 60 including allergen immunotherapy 61 without making any dose adjustments on their own or stopping medication which may lead to a higher risk of asthma exacerbations increased ocs use and a higher probability of the need for emergency room access and hospitalization risk factors for coronavirus exposure and spread likewise it is important to maintain well-controlled rhinitis and rhinosinusitis together with other known risk factors for asthma exacerbations 62the available data about ocs use in asthma exacerbations though limited to 3 reported cases in mild asthmatics 26 are in accordance with data from previous coronavirus outbreaks showing that systemic corticosteroids can be associated with a higher viral load 63 64 the uk data suggesting an increased death risk in patients with asthma especially in those who recently received systemic steroids 36 stress that clinicians must be cautious and recognize the differences between hypoxic respiratory failure and bronchospasm to carefully balance the need for ocs prescription 51and bronchodilators must be delivered by metered dose inhalers with spacers in order to prevent the viral spread related with nebulizer use 65as was shown by kaye et al 66 there is evidence of increased adherence to asthma and copd pharmacologic treatment during the first months of covid-19 which is encouraging and hopefully will have a positive effect on improvement of the control of asthma and minimize the need for acute care for this inflammatory chronic respiratory diseasein conclusion it is unclear whether patients with asthma are at a higher risk of developing covid-19 andor becoming severely ill future studies in all age groups are needed to provide a greater understanding of the impact of underlying asthma other allergic diseases and t2 inflammation on covid-19 susceptibility and disease outcomes

as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus but it is unique in its own right 1 researchers around the globe are investigating several risk factors that may contribute to the severity of covid-19 the world health organization who indicated that elderly individuals as well as those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing severe covid-19 disease 2 as of today june 14th 2020 more than 7800 million people are infected by the virus and more than 430500 have lost their lives most of the deaths are believed to be associated with the existence of comorbidities generally patients with compromised immune systems are considered to be particularly vulnerable 3 several research works have targeted the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with covid-19 however the risk factors for severity and mortality have not been sufficiently investigated 4 identifying major risk factors and taking corresponding clinical measures could contribute massively to saving lives most of the previous studies have identified comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus stroke cancer kidney issues and high cholesterol among the high-risk factors thus this paper represents a systematic review of the literature to shed light on the effects of these pre-existing conditions on covid-19 disease severity additionally as no method currently exists that can determine the level of risk these comorbidities pose this paper serves the purpose of achieving the only reasonable option to draw lessons from earlier experiences and practicesa search was conducted on the freely available covid-19 open research dataset cord-19 5 cord-19 is a resource consisting of 128000 scholarly articles including over 59000 articles with full text related to covid-19 sars-cov-2 and coronaviruses the dataset is frequently updated when new research appears in peer-reviewed publications and archive services became available to screen every article in the dataset we developed a search engine in addition to the bm25 search index 6 bm25 is a retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document regardless of their proximity within the document all papers are indexed by simply applying a preprocessing function to clean and tokenize the abstracts once all documents were indexed we created document vectors by loading optimized cached json tokens followed by applying a document similarity index using annoy 7 for more details of the implantation please visit httpsgithubcomdgunningcord19 filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions eg effects of hypertension on covidnormal coronavirussars-cov-2ncovcovid-19 disease severity mortality icu the search terms are repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paperdiabetes is one of the most serious comorbidities linked to the severity of all three well-known human pathogenic coronavirus infections including sars-cov 2 patients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications including adult respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure depending on the global region 2050 of covid-19 pandemic patients had diabetes which emphasizes the importance of the link between covid-19 and diabetes 8 according to gupta et al 9 individuals with diabetes are at risk of infections especially influenza and pneumonia patients with diabetes are severely affected when they contract respiratory viruses therefore diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza a 2009 h1n1 sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus merscov 10 11 12several studies show that among the covid-19 patients there was also a noticeable percentage of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus dm yang et al 13 found that among the 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 covid-19 patients 22 were diabetes patients additionally out of 1099 patients with confirmed covid-19 from autonomous regions in china 173 had severe disease with comorbidities in which 162 were dm 14 zhang et al 15 analyzed data for 140 patients who were admitted to hospitals in wuhan china with confirmed covid-19 cases 121 of these patients had diabetesmoreover zhang et al 16 reviewed 258 confirmed covid-19 patients who were hospitalized in wuhan china the authors indicated that patients with diabetes had significantly higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts as well as higher levels of fasting blood glucose serum creatinine urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme mb at admission compared to those without diabetes the cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes adjusted hazard ratio ahr  364 95 ci 1091221 and fasting blood glucose ahr  119 95 ci 108131 were associated with the fatality of covid-19 adjusting for potential confounders the authors concluded that dm is associated with greater disease severity and therefore recommended that primary and secondary prevention strategies are needed for covid-19 patients with diabetesbloomgarden et al 17 stated that mortality rates from pneumonia among patients with diabetes in hong kong age  75 exceed mortality rates in this age group from cardiovascular disease and cancer 18 similar evidence of risk amid persons with diabetes has been reported for the two earlier cov infections sars in 2002 1920 and mers in 2012 21furthermore diabetes was present in 423 of 26 fatalities due to covid-19 in a study from wuhan china 22 huang et al 23 investigated 41 hospital-admitted patients identified as having a laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection however these cases are only a small proportion of the patients affected a report of 72314 cases with 44672 confirmed covid-19 cases published by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention showed an increased mortality rate in people with diabetes 23 overall and 73 in patients with diabetes 24bello-chavolla oy 25 predicted mortality due to sars-cov-2 and developed a mechanistic score relating to obesity and diabetes to covid-19 outcomes in data from mexico among 71103 subjects the authors observed 15529 subjects with sars-cov-2 and 1434 deaths from sars-cov-2 or other causes risk factors for lethality in covid-19 included early-onset diabetes obesity advanced age immunosuppression and ckd the authors used stratified points the score of diabetes was 1 which indicated mild risk out of the 137 deaths from sars-cov-2 276 had diabetesa total of 174 patients confirmed with covid19 were studied by guo et al 26 the authors found that 24 patients with no other comorbidities except diabetes were at higher risk of severe pneumonia the release of tissue injuryrelated enzymes excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism the authors recommended that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for rapid progression and poor prognosis of covid19 the authors described a mortality rate of covid-19 amongst diabetic patients without other comorbidities of about 16 the above-mentioned studies are summarized in table 1
it is apparent that individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk for covid-19 infection and medical complications including death suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and covid-19 and its management no definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence and data 9 further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted 27 furthermore the article by guo et al 28 has left several relevant questions to be addressed does the association between covid19 and diabetes differ by different types of diabetes do antidiabetic drugs have an impact on disease progression is the impact of aging the same in diabetics as is in those without diabetes while the results of this study should be read in the light of some limitations such as the small sample size and the large age difference between study groups when patients with other comorbidities were excluded it still provides relevant insights that could inform about how covid-19 interacts with preexisting conditions 29according to a few recently published results mainly chinese cohort patients with cancer are more vulnerable to covid-19 complications however how susceptible cancer patients are to infection with covid-19 has yet to be establishedliang et al 30 collected and analyzed 2007 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions in china all cases were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 the number of covid-19 cases with a history of cancer is 18 1 95 ci 061165 out of 1590 covid-19 cases which according to 2015 cancer epidemiology statistics seems to be higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall chinese population 029 per 100000 people lung cancer was the most frequent type 28 compared with patients without cancer patients with cancer were relatively older had no significant differences in sex other baseline symptoms other comorbidities or baseline severity of x-ray most importantly patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events compared to patients without cancer 39 vs 8 of 1572 patients fishers exact p  00003 the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of covid-19 than individuals without cancer additionally they showed that patients with cancer had poorer outcomes from covid-19 providing a timely reminder to physicians that cancer patients require intensive care while infectedzhang et al 31 regarded cancer patients as a highly vulnerable group in the current covid-19 pandemic the authors included 28 cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from 3 designated hospitals in wuhan china from jan 2020 to feb 26 2020 the authors mentioned that cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the covid-19 infectionin addition yu et al 32 reviewed the medical records including demographic clinical and treatment data of 1524 patients in wuhan china from dec 30 2019 to feb 17 2020 outcomes of covid-19 among patients with cancer were reported the authors estimated the infection rate of sars-cov-2 in patients with cancer from a single institution to be 079 12 of 1524 patients 95 ci 0312 this was higher than the cumulative incidence of all diagnosed covid-19 cases that were reported in the city of wuhan over the same time 037 41152 of 11081000 cases data cutoff on february 17 2020 of the 1524 patients with cancer who were screened 228 had non-small-cell lung carcinoma nsclc the authors stated that patients with nsclc older than 60 years had a higher incidence of covid-19 than those aged 60 years or younger 43 vs 18 in table 2
 we summarize the details of the three mentioned case studiesin these mentioned studies lung cancer was most frequently observed and the covid-19 cases analyzed were all from hospitals in china however according to moujaess et al 33 such reports could lead many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care without solid evidence and recommendations the data presented should be carefully interpreted not only because of the small sample but also because cancer patients in this cohort mentioned in ref 30 for instance had a significantly older median age than their control 631 vs 487 years as well as a more significant history of smoking suggesting that these two factors might be associated with the poor covid-19 outcomes than the cancer history itself moreover these results should be interpreted with caution in the absence of adjustment to the prevalence of the different comorbidities in the chinese population 33 also xia et al 34 commented on the mentioned studies and highlighted reasons to be cautious suggesting that current evidence remains insufficient to explain a conclusive association between cancer and covid-19 though one effect that has risen concern is due to the number of covid-19 patients surpassing hospital and healthcare capacity cancer patients may be overlooked resulting in negative consequences in their treatmentshigh blood pressure hypertension is one of the most common conditions in severe covid-19 patients 35 in this section we review several studies that looked at the relationship between hypertension and the severity of covid-19 the relationship between high blood pressure and increased risk of pneumonia was a subject of a study that analyzed uk biobank data of 107310 hypertension patients with 3 of patients developing pneumonia afterward 36 the data analysis shows that the risk of respiratory disease is significantly higher in patients with hypertension patients with hypertension were also found to be at higher risk of acute respiratory disease and chronic lower respiratory disease independent of age sex smoking status and bmi generalizing these results to covid-19 is plausible and led to many studies that focus on hypertension as a strong indication of covid-19 severityseveral recent studies have investigated the variability in covid-19 disease severity in patients with hypertension and its medicinal therapy in ref 37 the authors reported that among 3017 hospitalized covid-19 patients 53 were diagnosed with hypertension furthermore the mortality rates among patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei for hypertension treatment 27 p  0001 as well as for patients on angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs 33 p  012 were lower compared to other anti-hypertensive agents 39 therefore these results support the continuation of acei and arb therapy for covid-19 hypertensive patientsthese results are supported by another study 38 where 126 covid-19 patients with hypertension were retrospectively grouped into arbsaceis n  43 and non-arbsaceis n  83 according to their antihypertensive medications a group of covid-19 patients without hypertension were then randomly selected to match the previous group based on age and sex the results of this study show that the arbsaceis group had a lower proportion of critical patients 93 vs 229 p  0061 and a lower death rate 47 vs 133 p  0216 however these differences are not statistically significantsimilarly liu et al 39 investigated the disease severity in patients with hypertension who used acei arb ccb and beta-blockers bb compared to patients who did not take any hypertension medication considering only 46 elderly patients age  65 the results show that patients who took arb have a significantly lower risk of developing a severe disease compared to patients who took no drugs however although patients who took acei ccb and bb also had a lower risk of developing severe disease there was no statistical significance compared to patients who took no drugs this could be due to the limited number of patients on these drugs compared to arbin another study 40 the authors argued based on their retrospective investigation of different hypertension drugs that calcium channel blockers ccbs show significant efficacy on covid-19 patients they also conducted in vitro experiments to examine the efficacy of ccbs and other hypertension drugs on blocking sars-cov-2 replication in cells the results show that only ccbs block virus replication however the blocking mechanism is not apparent therefore further investigations of ccbs efficacy on post-entry virus replication in vitro and clinically are neededalthough the studies cited above show hypertension medications are beneficial for covid-19 patients a recent retrospective observational study 41 found that patients with hypertension who took aceiarb drugs have a higher risk of developing a severe case of covid-19 p  0064 however this is not a statistically significant difference and may be due to the limited number of patients with hypertension 75 out of 274 covid-19 patients also the group of patients with hypertension were older and had more comorbidities such as chronic renal insufficiency cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertensioninterestingly another study 42 hypothesizes that hypertension treatment with acei and arbs which results in an upregulation of ace2 may increase the risk of developing severe covid-19 this is based on a structural study suggesting that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 as its receptor 43 it was also noted that ccb treatment of hypertension does not lead to an upregulation of ace2 which in turn makes it a safe treatment of hypertension in covid-19 patients however this theory is not supported by the previously cited retrospective studies on covid-19 patients who took acei and arbs 37 besides sanchis-gomar et al 44 noted that several health organizations have recommended the continued use of aceis and arbs for treating hypertension in covid-19 patients they also found based on their review study that there are no significant differences between aceis and arbs for managing hypertension with arbs being a more favorable option for severe cases of covid-19we also reviewed several articles that employed systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published studies on the effects of hypertension on covid-19 disease severity in ref 45 systematic reviews show that hypertension is one of the major comorbidities of fatality covid-19 cases similarly zuin et al 46 carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis that show covid-19 patients with hypertension have a significantly higher mortality risk however it is noted that further studies of other comorbidities either linked or not linked to hypertension are needed also roncon et al 47 looked at the rate of icu admission of covid-19 patients with hypertension they found that among the 1382 patients mean age  515 years 5774 males patients with hypertension had a significantly increased risk of icu admission or  254 95 ci 183354 p  00001 the above-mentioned cases are summarized in table 3
hypertension like diabetes has been proven to be linked to a significantly higher risk of respiratory infection making it a solid indicator of covid-19 severity additionally systematic reviews indicate hypertension to be common comorbidity in covid-19 death cases as well as be linked to significantly higher mortality risk and increased incidence of icu admission although it should be noted that further studies of other comorbidities connected to hypertension are necessary nonetheless it is evident that many patients with the virus also suffer from hypertension and as a result the comorbidity as well as its medicinal therapies on covid-19 have been observed it is also found that hypertension treatment should be continued to lower the severity risk some researchers recommended ccbs treatment and others found there are no significant differences in using aceis arbs or ccbs however there seems to be a general agreement with most health organizations who recommended hypertension treatment to be continued in covid-19 patients 44cholesterol level alteration has been found to occur during a viral infection such as hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv 48 the mechanism of alteration involves the virus binding to the scavenger receptor b type 1 sr-b1 that facilitates the selective uptake of high-density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol and other lipid components of receptor-bound hdl particles including free cholesterol fc and triglycerides tg 49 also it has been found that membrane cholesterol is an important component to facilitate viral entry into host cells 50 the role of cholesterol in viral infection was investigated even before the current pandemic of sars-cov-2 ren et al 51 found that cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane significantly impaired the efficiency of viral infection however this study was carried out in vitro on cells from swine testicles st and baby hamster kidney cells bhk21wei et al 49 studied the cholesterol metabolism of covid-19 patients compared to the normal reference population in general they found that fc hdl and ldl cholesterol level is significantly low for covid-19 patients compare to the reference population tg levels were also lower but not at a significant level moreover cholesterol metabolism of mild moderate severe and critical covid-19 patients was also presented and discussed the levels of hdl-c were significantly lower in patients with severe and critical disease than in patients with moderate or mild diseasein another study 52 hdl cholesterol levels along with serum albumin levels were used as predictors for the severity of covid-19 disease the study investigated the differences in clinical features between mild and severe covid-19 patients other features studied included hypoproteinemia hypoalbuminemia and decreased apoa1 patients were grouped into two types mild and severe and those in critical condition were not included it was also noted that patients with severe disease were significantly older median age 58 compared to patients with mild disease median age 37 their results show that patients with severe disease have significantly lower hdl cholesterol they also observed increased levels of albumin and hdl cholesterol in patients who were at the late stage of recovering from covid-19another recent study 53 looked at the serum cholesterol level in patients with covid-19 in wenzhou china the laboratory test results show that patients had significantly low fc hdl-cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels compared to healthy control moreover they investigated the cholesterol levels in two categories of patients primary infection cases being those who had been in wuhan and secondary infection cases being those who had never been in wuhan but were infected by person-to-person transmission they reported that hdl-cholesterol in the primary infection group was significantly lower than in the secondary infection group similar to the results in ref 52 the cholesterol levels of fc hdl and ldl were improving as patients recoveredthe inverse correlation between hdl cholesterol level and severity of covid-19 is also highlighted in ref 54 the author argued that taking statin drug therapy for cholesterol may increase covid-19 infections statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol and protect against a heart attack and stroke taking statins results in very low or no production of endogenous cholesterol which leads to the upregulation of ldl in the cell membrane this as stated earlier is found to be an important component to facilitate viral entry into host cells overview of articles investigating cholesterol levels in covid-19 patients is summarized in table 4
cholesterol has previously been investigated concerning many viral infections typically there is a selective uptake of cholesterol as viruses bind to the cellular membrane which ultimately enables severe infection therefore analyses have been conducted on the connection between covid-19 and cholesterol most publications indicated that fc hdl and ldl cholesterol levels were significantly low in patients with a viral infection compared to the control these studies explained the ability of sars-cov-2 virus to use serum cholesterol for its entry into host cells therefore low serum cholesterol level can be used as an early predictor of covid-19 severity in patients also observing improvement in serum cholesterol levels may indicate the improvement of conditions in patients it is also worth noting that statin drugs for cholesterol may contribute to the severity of covid-19 disease by inhibiting endogenous cholesterol leading to the upregulation of ldl this leads to higher membrane cholesterol levels that enhance the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter host cellsapart from fever and respiratory complications acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with covid-19 to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in covid-19 patients lin et al 55 used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data as well as an independent unpublished kidney single-cell rna-seq data generated in-house to evaluate ace2 gene expressions in all cell types of healthy kidneys and bladders the results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of the kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells these results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for covid-19 infection along with the respiratory system and digestion system the findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of sars and covid-19 patients may be due to proximal tubule cell damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury beyond that laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of covid-19as for the novel coronavirus a recent study reported that the human kidney is a specific target for sars-cov-2 infection 56 the authors examined the viral nucleocapsid protein in situ in the kidney post-mortem and found that sars-cov-2 antigens accumulated in kidney tubules suggesting that sars-cov-2 infects the human kidney directly inducing aki and contributing to viral spreading in the body 57alberici et al 58 describe 20 kidney transplant recipients median age 59 years 80 male with sars-cov2 induced pneumonia all patients presented with fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing overall 5 kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days from symptom onset these preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with sars-cov2 pneumonia thus in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients sars-cov-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by a high risk of progression and significant mortalitywang et al 59 conducted a study on one male patient age 49 with a history of close contact with a confirmed covid-19 case type 2 diabetes for 20 years and hypertension for 10 years the patient underwent comprehensive treatment for covid-19 organ transplant patients with covid-19 infection might have poorer prognosis because of their systemic immunosuppressive state however this severe case was cured even without discontinuing or reducing his immunosuppressant therapy this immunosuppressed case might help physicians to establish optimal treatment strategies for similar severe caseswhether covid-19 causes significant acute kidney injury aki remains controversial zhou et al 60 retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics urine and blood routine tests as well as other laboratory parameters of 178 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan china a total of 5 28 patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen bun indicating a few cases with kidney dysfunction however among the 83 466 patients with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization 45 542 patients displayed abnormality in urinalyses such as proteinuria hematuria and leukocyturia and none of the patients were recorded to have acute kidney injury aki throughout the study meanwhile the patients with abnormal urinalysis typically displayed worse disease progression that was reflected through laboratory parameter presentations including markers of liver injury inflammation and coagulation the authors concluded that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of covid-19 patients than blood chemistry tests additionally urinalysis could be used to reflect and predict disease severitycheng et al 61 determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury aki in patients with covid-19 and evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with covid-19 the authors studied a cohort of 701 patients with covid-19 in wuhan during 2020 of whom 113 161 died in hospitals during the study period aki occurred in 51 of patients kaplan-meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death thus the authors believed that the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of aki during hospitalization in patients with covid-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality hence clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe covid-19 overview of articles investigating kidney disease among covid-19 patients is summarized in table 5
in addition to the multiple complications observed acute kidney injury has also been detected in covid-19 patients results indicated the urinary system respiratory system and digestion system as potential routes for the covid-19 infection one study indicating the human kidney to be a specific target of the virus findings propose kidney abnormalities in covid-19 patients may be due to proximal tubule cell damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury additionally in one study sars-cov-2 antigens were seen to accumulate in kidney tubules implying the direct impact on the kidney leading to aki induction and viral spread within the body there have also been studies describing a rapid clinical deterioration escalating oxygen requirement high risk of progression and significant mortality in kidney transplant patients similarly the incidence of kidney disease on admission as well as the development of aki is correlated with fatality in covid-19 patients however if covid-19 causes acute kidney injury remains uncertain many authors concluded that clinicians must still try to increase their awareness of kidney issues in patients with severe infection and a urinalysis may be used to predict the extent of disease severityacute stroke remains a medical emergency even during the covid-19 pandemic avula et al 62 investigated 4 patients with covid-19 that also presented acute stroke all 4 patients had radiographic evidence of stroke and pcr-confirmed covid-19 infection the authors elucidated the clinical characteristics imaging findings and the clinical course they warned that covid-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and should use appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient further studies are urgently needed to improve the current understandings of neurological pathology in the setting of covid-19 infectionklok et al 63 evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of ischemic stroke in 184 patients admitted to the icu of 3 dutch hospitals the patients were proven to have covid-19 induced pneumonia of whom 23 died 13 all patients received at least the standard doses of thromboprophylaxis the 31 incidence of thrombotic complications in icu patients with covid-19 infections is remarkably high therefore the authors recommended to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all covid-19 patients admitted to the iculodigiani et al 64 studied 388 symptomatic patients 16 requiring icu admittance with laboratory-proven covid-19 admitted to a university hospital in milan italy the primary outcome was a thromboembolic complication including venous thromboembolism vte ischemic stroke and acute coronary syndrome acsmyocardial infarction mi the high number of arterial and in particular venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission as well as the high rate of positive vte imaging tests among the few covid-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific vte diagnostic strategies as well as investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory covid-19 patientsmao et al 65 studied the neurologic manifestations of patients with covid-19 in wuhan china the authors collected data from 3 designated special care centers for covid-19 of the union hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan china the study included 214 mean age 727 years 407 men 589 had a non-severe infection and 88 patients 411 had a severe infection consecutive hospitalized patient with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 however it has not been reported that patients with covid-19 had any neurologic manifestationsin a note to eur neurol journal editor morelli et al 66 mentioned that between february 21 2020 first covid-19 patient recorded in italy and march 25 2020 there were only 6 admissions from the casualty department for ischemic stroke the authors suggested that the reason could be the controversial role il-6 plays in stroke although high il-6 levels have been reported to harm brain infarct volume and long-term outcome 67 in ischemic stroke there has also been experimental evidence that il-6 has a protective effect and helps in the improvement of poststroke angiogenesis 68 this could also be due to the presence of thrombocytopenia in covid-19 patients indeed what may be true for influenza pneumonia ie increased stroke risk may not be true for sarscov-2 the main limitation of the remark however is certainly the short observation period of just 1 monthoxley et al 69 reported 5 4 male 1 female large-vessel stroke patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 who presented in the health system of new york city severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection was diagnosed in all five patients although the patients were having covid-19 related symptoms such as fever cough and lethargy all of them had a reduced nih stroke scalescore nihss overview of articles investigating stroke among covid-19 patients is summarized in table 6
one study identified 364 of covid patients to have neurological symptoms mainly in patients with severe disease and several mechanisms of covid-19 that increase stroke risk have been recognized but neither has been proven as significant further studies are required to investigate the neurological pathology during covid-19 infection additionally there may be a need to improve specific vte diagnostic strategies the safety of thromboprophylaxis and further identify the role il-6 plays in ischemic stroke however the risks associated with ischemic stroke in covid-19 patients are still uncertain as with cancer patients medical resources must be allocated to target the strain covid-19 has placed on ischemic stroke care meanwhile the relationship between covid-19 and stroke must be examined furtherthe studies reviewed in this paper have assessed the effects of diabetes cancer hypertension high cholesterol kidney issues and stroke on covid-19 severity through a thorough examination of the evidence provided in these reports inferences on the relationship between these preexisting conditions and covid-19 can be madein conclusion it can be observed that diabetes hypertension and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to covid-19 severity other comorbidities such as cancer kidney issues and stroke must be further evaluated to detect a strong relationship to the virus additionally treatment options must be examined further to provide optimal treatment and ensure better outcomes for patients suffering from these comorbidities however it should be noted that whether definitive measurements exist or not the care of patients as well as the research involved should be largely prioritized to tackle this deadly pandemicthe authors declare that they have no competing interestsin march 2003 the world health organization issued a global alert because a case of atypical pneumonia of unknown cause subsequently defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was reported in the journal diabetic medicine in 2006 we reported that ambient hyperglycemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in sars patients although hyperglycemia was a predictor for mortality in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with acute illnesses its association with sars looked quite different even patients with mild sars who did not use any glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of fpg on the first day of hospitalization than those who were initially suspected of having sars but later diagnosed with non-sars pneumonia 1 acute damage to pancreatic -cells by coronavirus may occur during systemic illness however experimental studies are needed to test this hypothesisangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the only recognized human homologue of ace the key regulator of blood pressure and has approximately 42 identical protein sequences since its discovery in 2000 2 3 ace2 has been implicated in heart function hypertension and diabetes with its effects being mediated in part through its ability to convert angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 unexpectedly ace2 also serves as the cellular entry point for sars coronavirus sars-cov 4 5in this study we investigated the pathogenesis of pancreatic lesions and glucose intolerance in sars patients by determining whether biochemical parameters measuring involvements of liver kidney heart lung and the endocrine part of pancreas after hospitalization were predictors for death and whether these involvements especially in the endocrine part of the pancreas were associated with tissue-specific ace2 expressionthis study included 135 patients who died from sars 385 hospitalized sars patients who survived and 19 patients who were initially suspected of having sars but later diagnosed with non-sars pneumonia the diagnostic criteria for sars defined by the chinese ministry of health are similar to those of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 6 the final diagnosis for patients with equivocal clinical presentations was made by a team of experts and was based on findings of computed tomographic ct imaging of the lung the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the beijing municipal bureau of healthdemographic data the first blood cell count performed

those plotted for patients with lower than the cut-off level the log-rank test was used for testing the homogeneity of survival functions across strata and was computed by pooling over any defined

a key enzyme in the renin angiotensin system ras ace converts angiotensin ang i to the vasoconstrictor ang ii which is thought to be responsible for most of the physiological and pathophysiological effects of the ras this classical view of the ras was challenged with the discovery of the enzyme ace2 which not only degrades ang ii but also leads to formation of the vasodilatory and anti-proliferative peptide ang 17 8sars-cov infection is mediated by the binding of its spike s protein to a cellular receptor on its target cells and a recent study proved that ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov s protein 4 5 an investigation of ace2 protein localization in 15 human organs found that ace2 was abundant in the epithelia of lung and small intestine where sars-cov might enter 9 another investigation of 72 human tissues by harmer and his colleagues 10 confirmed ace2 mrna expression in bronchus lung parenchyma ileum testis and cardiovascular renal and gastrointestinal tissues and pancreasthe multi-system nature of sars infection has been demonstrated in several autopsy studies 1113 these studies demonstrated atypical pathological changes such as hydropic degeneration fatty degeneration and interstitial cell proliferation involving the liver heart kidney and pancreas in patients suspected of having died from sars in one study of alimentary tract and digestive glands from seven sars autopsies routine pathology electron microscopy em in situ hybridization ish immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr found no evidence of direct viral infection in the liver or pancreas 14 in another study of patients who died of sars immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using a murine monoclonal antibody specific for sars-cov nucleoprotein and probes specific for a sars-cov rna polymerase gene fragment respectively found sars-cov mainly in the lung and distal convoluted renal tubule and to a much lesser extent in the pancreas and liver 15 interestingly ace2 mrna was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following bile duct ligation 363-fold and in healthy livers ace2 protein was confined to endothelial cells occasional bile ducts and perivenular hepatocytes but in human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression 97-fold of ace2 protein 16in this study immunostaining for ace2 protein was strong in the pancreatic islets but very weak in the exocrine tissues abundant ace2 immunostaining was found in alveolar epithelial cells of the lung parietal epithelial cells of the kidney myocardium of the heart but not in hepatocytes these differences in ace2 expression in different organs were consistent with our findings showing differences in survival associated with elevations in various parameters significant elevation in levels of ast ldh and s-cr and severe hypoxia were associated with higher death rate which suggested sars damaged several organs including heart kidney and lung however significant elevation of alt an indicator of liver damage was not associated with higher mortality our results implied that the higher the level of expression the greater the level of damage by sars-cov interestingly hyperglycemia as another possible reason for higher death rate was supported by our idea that coronavirus acutely damaged the pancreatic islets leading to hyperglycemia consistent with our finding that pancreatic islets are strongly immunopositive for ace2 while exocrine tissues are only weakly positive there are almost no reports of pancreatitis in patients with sarsmany viruses such as enteroviruses coxsackie b virus retroviruses rubella mumps cytomegalovirus epsteinbarr and varicella zoster virus have been implicated on the basis of temporal and geographical associations in the development of type 1 diabetes in humans indeed serological evidence of infection and isolation of viruses from the pancreas have been reported in a few cases of recently diagnosed diabetes 17 18in our previous report hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of death and patients with even mild sars receiving no glucocorticoid medications during the course had a higher level of fpg 1 in our follow-up study diabetes occurred during the hospitalization of 20 of 39 patients who received no corticosteroids during the course of sars but after 3 years of follow-up only two of these patients had diabetes also after 3 years follow-up fpg ppg and insulin levels were similar in the sars group and their matched healthy non-sars siblings which suggested that the damage of islets by sars-cov was transienta causal relation between varicella zoster virus and the onset of diabetes was suggested in two individuals presenting with acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for a brief period 19 both had been infected with chicken pox in the recent past after good diabetic control had been established insulin was withdrawn over a few weeks follow-up for the next two years did not reveal recurrence of diabetesin brief we found that sars-cov damaged the kidney heart lung and endocrine part of the pancreas as indicated by the results of initial assays of s-cr ldh ckmb sao2 and fpg and that these measures were predictors for death and correlated with ace2 expression in multiple organs its expression in the exocrine and endocrine tissues of the pancreas suggests that sars-cov may damage islets and cause acute insulin dependent diabetes mellituson 31 december 2019 several clusters of an unusual pneumonia were reported in wuhan china1 analysis of five patient samples identified the causative agent as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 an enveloped positive-sense rna virus that is 96 identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus2 and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus2 3the clinical manifestations of the pneumonia have ranged from mild lower respiratory tract symptoms to the more severe manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and associated high mortality4 and the new disease has been named 2019 coronavirus disease or covid-19 by the who3 the usa reported its first case on 20 january 2020 in washington5 by 11 march 2020 the who declared covid-19 a pandemic with over 118 000 cases in 114 countries and 4291 deaths6 as of 6 april 2020 there were over 1 210 965 cases worldwide with 67 594 deaths of those the usa has made up 330 891 confirmed cases and over 8910 deaths7
diabetes mellitus is consistently one of the most common comorbidities found in patients with covid-19 guan et al
8 showed that approximately 7 of the patients with covid-19 had diabetes as a comorbidity however the prevalence of diabetes was almost threefold higher in covid-19 patients with severe disease 162 as compared with those with non-severe disease 57 zhou et al
9 showed that diabetes was an associated comorbidity in 14 of the patients with covid-19 that survived but increased to 31 in those who were non-survivors li et al
10 in a recently published meta-analysis of six published studies showed that the incidence of diabetes in intensive care unit icu patients with covid-19 was twofold higher than non-icu patients the cdc recently reported11 that the incidence of diabetes was 109 among 7162 patients in the usa on whom completed information on underlying health conditions or potential risk factors was available as of 28 march 2020 the incidence of diabetes was 6 in those not hospitalized but increased to 24 in those hospitalized non-icu and 32 in those admitted to the icu thus almost one-third of patients with covid-19 admitted to the icu with severe disease in usa have diabetes as an underlying health condition taken together diabetes may be associated with a higher risk of severe covid-19 disease and a necessity for mechanical ventilation as well as risk of deathwhy do some patients with covid-19 develop severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation in the icu and associated with significant mortality chen et al
12 have recently shown that compared with moderate cases severe cases of covid-19 more frequently had lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase lactate dehydrogenase ldh c reactive protein crp ferritin and d-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of interleukin il 2 receptor il-2r il-6 il-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- the authors showed that absolute number of t lymphocytes cd4 t cells and cd8 t cells were decreased in nearly all the patients and were markedly lower in severe cases than moderate cases the expressions of interferon-gamma ifn- by cd4 t cells tended to be lower in severe cases than moderate cases the authors concluded that the sars-cov-2 infection induced a cytokine storm and lymphopenia particularly a decrease in cd4 t cell and cd8 t cell counts as well as suppressed ifn- production by cd4 t cells which might be correlated with disease severity similarly huang et al
4 have shown that compared with non-icu patients icu patients with severe covid-19 had higher plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 and tnf-alphawhy is diabetes associated with severe covid-19 lung disease requiring admission to the icu in a report in this journal yan et al
13 studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes in 48 severe covid-19 patients with diabetes and compare them with 145 patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes hospitalized in china in a retrospective single center observational study the authors demonstrate that compared with non-diabetics patients with diabetes and severe covid-19 exhibited a severe inflammatory response and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation and have a higher mortality and a reduced survival duration indeed the mortality rate of 81 in patients with diabetes with severe covid-19 disease and 48 in those without diabetes is alarming although the authors caution that the patient population hospitalized was sicker and with an overall higher mortality 56 as compared with other published analysis furthermore patients with diabetes had a higher white cell count neutrophil count crp il-2r il-6 il-8 d-dimer ldh as well as n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp and a lower lymphocyte count these results suggest a greater proinflammatory cytokine response as compared with non-diabetics it may also be cautioned that severe covid-19 patients with diabetes were older in age and had associated comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease than the non-diabetic patients although even after adjustment for these comorbidities patients with diabetes had a lower survival rate than non-diabetics unfortunately patients with type 1 diabetes were not included in the analysis information about this group would have helped assess outcomes in younger covid-19 patients with diabetes who were also less likely to have associated comorbiditiesthe authors do show that survivors with covid-19 and diabetes did not differ significantly from non-survivors with diabetes in the prevalence of associated comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease or chronic pulmonary disease men with diabetes and severe covid-19 were more likely to die in addition non-survivors with diabetes had a higher white cell and neutrophil count crp il-2r il-6 tnf-alpha and a lower lymphocyte count also non-survivors with diabetes had a greater impairment in cardiac higher troponin i hepatic renal and coagulation parameters survival in patients with diabetes was independent of overall glycemic control glycated hemoglobin on hospitalization however it may be pointed out that given that a small number of patients with diabetes that survived nine patients as compared with non-survivors 39 patients this analysis should be interpreted with cautionin conclusion yan et al have shown that patients with diabetes and severe covid-19 have higher proinflammatory cytokines and a worse survival rate than non-diabetics diabetes prevalence is high in the usa and china and in countries such as india where the covid-19 cases are continuing to increase thus diabetes and covid-19 pose a significant challenge to healthcare providers globally given the significant mortality in those with severe diseaseduring the past two decades the outbreak and prevalence of severe acute respiratory infections have been seen as one of the most serious hazards to global health both two prominent coronaviruses 2002 sars-cov and 2012 mers-cov have markedly affected humans causing 8422 and 1600 infections as well as 916 and 574 deaths respectively 1 2in early december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases with unknown reason emerged in wuhan hubei china high-throughput sequencing from lower respiratory tract samples has revealed a novel coronavirus that was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and also named sars-cov-2 3 as of february 17th 2020 70636 confirmed cases and 1772 death cases have been documented in china 2019-ncov also targets the respiratory tract and shares many similar clinical symptoms with sars-cov and mers-cov 3 common symptoms include fever fatigue and dry cough followed always by anorexia myalgia dyspnea and so on 48 lymphopenia and prolonged prothrombin time are also the most common characteristics 46in addition as cardiologists we are also concerned about whether patients with cardiovascular disease are at greater risk for 2019-ncov and whether new coronavirus infections have an impact on the cardiovascular system previous studies have shown a relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and sars and mers 911 a systematic analysis of 637 mers-cov cases showed that diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in about 50 of the patients and cardiac diseases are present in 30 of the cases 11 diabetes was seen as an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in patients with sars 9 with the spread of 2019-ncov and increase of the cases more and more 2019-ncov infected individuals exhibit comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes and cardia-cerebrovascular disease in chens study of 99 cases 40 patients had cardia-cerebrovascular disease 6 and in huangs study of 41 cases 20 patients had diabetes 4 these cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities might render them more susceptible to poor prognosis given the rapid spread of 2019-ncov an updated meta-analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by integrating the published studies is urgently warranted accordingly the present analysis will not only identify the cardiovascular epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-ncov infection with greater precision but also unravel the impact of the infection on the cardiac injurypreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual participant data the prisma-ipd statement was followed for the conduct and reporting of this meta-analysis 12to identify all the studies illustrating the prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in 2019 novel coronavirus infection in china embase and pubmed were carefully searched from december 2019 to february 2020 the following search terms or keywords were used alone or in combination novel coronavirus influenza pneumonia cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and cardiac injuryinclusion criteria are as follows 1 comparative studies randomised controlled trials rcts or non-rcts published in english 2 study population more than ten participants were included in the study 3 study intervention patients in the studies should be confirmed to have been infected by 2019 novel coronavirus 4 parameters the comorbidities of cardiovascular metabolic diseases and the outcome of cardiac injury should be given case reports non-human studies studies without adequate information and studies written in chinese for the fear of data duplication were excluded in the present meta-analysisprevalence of comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes table 1 and fig 2 together with clinical outcome of cardiac injury confirmed by elevation of troponin it or the creatine kinase seen as the second choice if troponin it were not provided were extracted from the identified studies table 1 and fig 3 the primary outcome measure was to compare the prevalence of comorbidities and impact on cardiac injury in icu and non-icu cases severe and non-severe data as the second choice if icu data was not provided cochrane collaborations tool was followed to assess the risk of biasall analyses were performed using openmeta analyst version 1010 httpswwwcebmbrowneduopenmeta and revman software version 53 forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of the cardiovascular metabolic diseases in 2019-ncov infection severity from the selected studies as well as the impact of the 2019-ncov infection on the cardiac injury the results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models mantelhaenszel method 13 or random-effect models in cases of significant heterogeneity between estimates 14 we used the i2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity 25 50 and 75 represented low moderate and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively the chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results the fixed effect model was used if i2  50 and the random effect model was used if i2  50 15after initially identifying 399 articles 111 duplicate documents were identified of the leaving trials after review of the titles and abstracts 277 documents of non-human researches reviews and studies that were not clinical trials were excluded the leaving 11 studies were carefully and detailed evaluated at last six studies were excluded because the participants of the trials did not meet the criteria we have set then one study published in medrxiv was added finally a total of six studies with 1527 patients were included 46 8 16 17 fig 1 all of the selected studies were published in 2020 with different sample patient sizes that ranged from 11 to 1099 patients table 1 summarizes the study characteristicssystematic analysis of studies that described the epidemiological and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reported the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases as well as the impact on cardiac injury in the infectious disease has identified six reports with 1527 patients table 1 the majority of the cases were localized in wuhan or recent travel to wuhan or contact people from wuhan the median ages were respectively 56 49 47 555 34 and 57 years old according to the six studies the infection was diagnosed throughout the whole spectrum of age covering from new born to 92 years old in all of the studies men were more likely to be infected than women and the overall proportion of male is 578meta-analysis for the identified studies showed that the most prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities were hypertension 171 95 ci 99244 and cardia-cerebrovascular disease 164 95 ci 66261 followed by diabetes 97 95 ci 69125 fig 2 there was a significant heterogeneity cochrans q in the estimates of comorbidities among the identified studies with an i2 index varied from 47 to 95 fig 2we then compared the difference of the prevalence of the three diseases between severe patients and non-severe patients or icu patients vs non-icu patients according to the data in the studies for hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease the heterogeneity test results were calculated as i2  47 and 26 thus the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses the results from the three included studies with a total amount of 1278 patients showed that hypertension accounted for 288 of icusevere cases but 141 of non-icusevere cases a similar pattern was found in cardia-cerebrovascular disease statistics it accounted for 167 of icusevere cases but 62 of non-icusevere cases the proportion hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease were both statistically significant higher in icusevere patients compared to the non-icusevere patients hypertension rr  203 95 ci 154 268 z  504 p  000001 cardia-cerebrovascular disease rr  330 95 ci 203 536 z  481 p  000001 fig 2 for diabetes the heterogeneity test showed that i2  67 and so the random effect model was used diabetes accounted for 117 of icusevere cases but 40 of non-icusevere cases the result indicated a higher proportion of diabetes in icusevere patients but without statistical significance rr  221 95 ci 088 557 z  168 p  009 fig 2at last we focused on the impact of the covid-19 on the cardiac injury two studies that gave clear data were statistically analyzed and the data showed that 80 95 ci 41120 patients might be suffered from an acute cardiac injury another two studies only gave the data of creatine kinase if it can be seen as a biomarker of cardiac injury the proportion might be 115 95 ci 78152 when we attempted to compare the differences of cardiac injury incidences between icusevere patients and non-icusevere patients we just included the two studies which specifically identified myocardial injury the data again showed a significant higher incidence of acute cardiac injury in icusevere patients compared to the non-icusevere patients rr  1348 95 ci 360 5047 z  386 p  00001 fig 3 the funnel plots demonstrated symmetrical distributions of the effect size of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and cardiac injury on either side of the pooled estimate but a non-symmetrical distribution of the effect size of diabetes fig 4 coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses which include six species that can cause diseases in humans to our knowledge 18 four viruses among them 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 have been reported to cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals 18 however the two other strains are the infamous sars-cov and mers-cov which have been linked to fatal illness and caused plagues and large numbers of deaths 19 complete genome sequences of 2019-ncov showed that it is identified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviridae family the same subgenus with sars-cov 3according to previous research on sars-cov the presence of comorbidities increased the mortality risk with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most important components to predict adverse outcomes 20 cardiac disease and diabetes increase the risk of death by twice as much as other risk factors 20 thus it is necessary for us to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac and metabolic diseases in covid-19 the present systematic analysis summarized the data from all of the five studies of covid-19 the results demonstrated that the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were respectively 171 164 and 97 according to summary of the 2018 report on cardiovascular diseases in china the morbidities of the hypertension and diabetes were respectively 232 and 109 and there were about 13 million of cerebrovascular disease patients and 11 million of cardiovascular patients 21 therefore comparing the data to the report we did not find that people with hypertension and diabetes were more susceptible to 2019-ncov infection the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population even slightly lower however comparing the general population the incidence of cardia-cerebrovascular disease in patients with covid-19 is obviously much higherdue to the sample size and limited time so far data collection is still incomplete and most of the studies have not analyzed comorbidities in death cases so the relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and covid-19-induced death cannot be determined but what is assuredly is that patients with hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases or diabetes are more likely to develop severeicu cases after 2019-ncov infection the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds threefolds and twofolds respectively higher in icusevere cases than in their non-icusevere counterparts although the difference of diseases in the meta-analysis is not statistical the rr value is about 221 and we consider this might because of the sample size of included studies and the algorithm adopts the random effect model which is a more conservative approach so we speculate the result might reach statistical significance when more researches publish their dataanother important finding is the damage the virus did to the heart according to the present summary at least 80 patients with covid-19 suffered acute cardiac injury in chens report the first death was a 61-year old man with no previous chronic underlying disease after he was admitted by icu he had developed severe respiratory failure heart failure and sepsis and then experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead 6 this case reminded us that patients with a novel coronavirus might develop acute cardiac injury and further analysis indicates us that the incidence of myocardial injury is much higher in icusevere patients about 13 folds more than non-icucardiac patients and furthermore the observation also reminded us that patients with covid-19 associated with unstable angina or stemi have poor cardiac reserve lower tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop cardiac insufficiency leading to deterioration according to the information released by shanghai health commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was a patient 88 years old with a serious history of hypertension cardiac dysfunction the analysis of death causes suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction and in the course of its onset the 2019 ncov infection is only the inducementthe pathogenesis of 2019 ncov infection-related acute myocardial injury is still unknown but according to the clinical presentation and lab data of the disease as well as the pathogenesis of sars-cov it can be speculated that 2019-ncov infection may affect the cardiovascular system through multiple mechanismsfirst viral infection directly causes damage to cardiomyocyte according to oudits study sars-cov viral rna was detected in 35 of autopsied human heart samples from sars-cov infected patients during the toronto sars outbreak 22 and they also confirmed that pulmonary infection with the human sars-cov in mice led to an ace2-dependent myocardial infection 22 ace2 is an important target for sars-cov 23 and molecular modelling has shown high structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and 2019-ncov 24 ace2 expression is highly tissue-specific mainly expressed in the cardiovascular renal and gastrointestinal systems with a small amount expressed in lung cells therefore in addition to coronaviruses causing pneumonia through ace2 receptors in lung epithelial cells we also need to pay attention to possible viral effects on myocardial tissue second hypoxaemia may be also an important reason of cardiac injury in huangs study 32 covid-19 patients had various degree of hypoxaemia and need required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support in chens study up to 76 of patients require oxygen therapy due to severe 2019-ncov infection the pneumonia may cause significant gas exchange obstruction leading to hypoxaemia which significantly reduces the energy supply by cell metabolism and increases anaerobic fermentation causing intracellular acidosis and oxygen free radicals to destroy the phospholipid layer of cell membrane meanwhile hypoxia-induced influx of calcium ions also leads to injury and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes third huangs study noted that high concentration of il-1 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 could be detected in patients infected with 2019-ncov which might lead to activated t-helper-1 th1 cell responses 4 furthermore they also found that icu patients had much higher concentrations of inflammatory factors than those non-icu patients suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 4 in addition repeated floods of catecholamines due to anxiety and the side effects of medication can also lead to myocardial damagein conclusion patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of infection of 2019-ncov and it can also greatly affect the development and prognosis of pneumonia simultaneously we should pay close attention to viral infection-related heart damage in the course of disease treatmentcoronavirus disease covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this virus mainly causes lung and immune system damage covid-19 is currently a global pandemic and has caused a large number of deaths in many countries several studies have shown that the severity and mortality with covid-19 are related to age and comorbidities including diabetes hypertension cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases 1 2hba1c is considered the gold standard for evaluating blood glucose level and provides an average value of the past 3 months and high hba1c level is related to the risk of complications in diabetic patients 3 however whether the increase in hba1c level is related to high inflammation hypercoagulability and mortality in covid-19 patients has not been reported we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the effect of high hba1c level on mortality and inflammation in covid-19 patients with abnormal glucose metabolismduring the admission period from february 928 2020 the hba1c levels of 136 patients tested positive for covid-19 in 3 wards of wuhan tongji hospital were determined four patients were excluded from the study because the following factors affected the hba1c level 2 patients were receiving glucocorticoids for kidney transplantation and chronic systemic lupus erythematosus 1 was a hemolytic anemia patient and 1 patient had myelosuppression after leukemia chemotherapy after excluding these patients 132 patients were finally included the patients baseline demographic characteristics are given in table 1
 covid-19 was diagnosed based on the the chinese novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan trial version seven issued by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 4 diabetes was diagnosed based on the 2019 who diagnostic criteria for diabetes 5 the covid-19 patients were divided into three groups a b and c patients in group a had no diabetes and their hba1c level was 60 patients in group b had no diabetes and their hba1c level was 60 patients in group c were diabetic there were 41 patients in group a 44 patients in group b and 47 patients in group c thirty-one patients 660 in group c had a history of type 2 diabetes and 16 patients 340 were newly diagnosed with diabetes patients with history of diabetes received more than one oral hypoglycemic drug before hospital admission the most common drug received was metformin followed by acarbose of which 12 patients 255 were receiving insulin therapy before admissionsince this was a retrospective cohort study the data pertaining to patient characteristics medical history symptoms and signs laboratory examination results blood oxygen saturation sao2 at admission and final clinical outcomes were collected from an electronic medical record system for analysis of all the laboratory examination results the minimum blood leukocyte and lymphocyte count values and the maximum values of ferritin crp interleukin tumor necrosis factor- tnf- and lactate dehydrogenase ldh levels fibrinogen fbg and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr were considered in this study the date of onset of covid-19 was considered based on the date of onset of symptoms all patients were treated in accordance with the the chinese novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan trial version seven and were followed up until april 6 2020 the study was approved by the ethics committee of peking university peoples hospitalcategorical variables are expressed in terms of frequency and percentage and were compared using the chi-square test continuous variables are expressed as mean  standard deviation for normal distribution and were compared by performing analysis of variance median and interquartile range iqr were used for skewed distribution a p-value  005 was considered statistically significant all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics for windows version 240 ibm usaa total of 132 patients tested positive for covid-19 by undergoing the sars-cov-2 rna test were included in our study the median age of the patients was 66 years iqr 5672 years ranging from 24 to 88 years the number of men was 68 while the number of women was 64 a total of 88 667 of the patients had comorbidities of which hypertension was the most common 500 followed by diabetes 356 cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease 242 and chronic kidney disease 76 seven patients had chronic renal failure undergoing long-term maintenance hemodialysis and received intermittent renal replacement therapy irrt at bedside during hospitalization the median time from onset to admission was 14 iqr 100178 days sao2 was 95 iqr 9097 without oxygen inhalation at the time of admission ranging from 59 to 99 table 1the median hba1c level was 64 iqr 5872 and there were significant differences among the groups with regard to various parameters including sao2 serum ferritin crp esr fibrinogen fbg and il6 levels p  001 table 2
 a pairwise comparison within the groups showed that the differences between groups c and a and groups b and a were statistically significant in terms of esr crp serum ferritin fbg and il6 levels fig 1
 correlation analysis revealed that there was a linear negative correlation between sao2 and hba1c while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin crp fbg and esr levels and hba1c fig 2
a total of 22 patients died 167 during hospitalization including 4 deaths in group a 98 5 deaths in group b 1140 and 13 deaths in group c 277 all patients underwent terminal withdrawal of mechanical ventilation there was a statistically significant difference between groups a and c in terms of mortality rate p  003 table 3
in our study owing to the presence of acute viral infections we did not consider hba1c as the diagnostic standard for diabetes according to the guidelines 5 this is the first study to report that diabetic patients contracting covid-19 have more severe inflammation and higher mortality 6 and that inflammations markers such as serum ferritin level crp level and esr in covid-19 cases and the coagulation factor fbg were positively correlated with hba1c level while sao2 was negatively correlated with hba1c level even in patients with only elevated hba1c level and no diabetes the levels of inflammation markers and fbg were also significantly increased fig 1 p  005 however little is known about the mechanism concerning the increase in the levels of inflammation markers and hba1c level in case of covid-19 patients previous studies have shown that diabetes not only causes epithelial dysfunction of pulmonary cilia increased vascular system permeability alveolar epithelial damage and alveolar collapse but also contributes to abnormal immune system function 7 8 similarly in severely ill covid-19 patients the lungs spleen and lymph node structures are damaged and lymphocyte counts are reduced 9 both diabetes and covid-19 may synergistically damage the immune and respiratory systems further diabetic patients have more comorbidities due to which there is more target organ damage this together with covid-19 leads to a more severe inflammation hypercoagulability an even low oxygenation and eventually higher mortalitycovid-19 patients with higher hba1c level may exhibit relatively higher level of severity and the infection itself may also lead to an increase in hba1c level previous studies have also found that in severe acute respiratory syndrome sars patients even those with mild symptoms who do not receive glucocorticoid therapy during the course of the disease had higher fasting blood glucose levels 10 in our study after excluding treatment with exogenous corticosteroids hemolysis the hba1c level of 667 88132 patients was still higher than normal 4060 of which 121 16132 patients were newly diagnosed with diabetes for the new-onset diabetes patients previously reported studies along with this study suggest that covid-19 may cause and aggravate abnormal glucose metabolismthe possible mechanisms of covid-19 causing abnormal glucose metabolism include islet  cell damage and insulin resistance previous studies have reported that some viruses can directly cause pancreatic -cell damage 11 12 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a sars-cov-2 receptor has higher expression in pancreatic endocrine tissues than in exocrine tissues 13 autopsy showed that although a small number of islet cells were degenerated in pancreatic tissue while immunohistochemical analysis and polymerase chain reaction tests did not detect the presence of sars-cov-2 in pancreatic islet cells 9 thus indicating that there is insufficient evidence regarding sars-cov-2-induced damage of islet cells levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 crp serum amyloid a tnf- il-1 and il-6 have been shown to be increased in obese and type 2 diabetic patients il-1 can cause islet  cell dysfunction and apoptosis and the levels of these factors can be reduced by lifestyle-related changes and weight loss which suggests that inflammatory markers may be involved in islet  cell damage and insulin resistance 14 inflammatory factors released in response to sars-cov-2 may also be involved in islet -cell damage and insulin resistance resulting in abnormal glucose metabolism in our study patients had 14 iqr 100178 days from the onset of symptoms to admission abnormal glucose metabolism for a long period of time may cause an increase in hbv1c levelthere are some limitations in this study first it was a retrospective study and the bias caused by excluding the 4 patients may have affected the results second due to the limitation caused by the number of deaths multivariate regression analysis could not be performed to determine whether the increase in hba1c level was an independent risk factor for the death of covid-19 patients third after 3 years of follow-up of sars patients yang et al found that the fasting blood glucose postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels of the sars group and their paired healthy non-sars siblings were similar suggesting that sars-cov-related islet damage and insulin resistance is for a short duration similarly whether the increase in hba1c level in covid-19 patients is transient is also uncertain due to the short observation time hence further investigations are requiredin conclusion hba1c is associated with inflammation hypercoagulability and low sao2 in covid-19 patients and the mortality rate is higher in diabetic patients performing the hba1c test after admission is helpful for assessing inflammation hypercoagulability and prognosis
although type 2 diabetes t2d is a major comorbidity of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the impact of blood glucose control on the degree of medical interventions required and on all-cause mortality of patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d remains unclear here zhu et al report that among 7300 individuals with covid-19 among which nearly 1000 had t2d in hubei province china those with t2d had significantly increased medical interventions and mortality risk but among the patients with t2d those with well-controlled blood glucose regulation upper limit  10 mmoll fared much better than those with poorly controlled blood glucose upper limit  10 mmoll these findings provide clinical evidence correlating more proper blood glucose control with improved outcomes in patients with covid-19
the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by infection from the newly emerged highly contagious coronavirus sars-cov-2 wu and mcgoogan 2020 sars-cov-2 mainly invades the respiratory tract and lungs leading to a new type of coronavirus pneumonia zhu et al 2020 the severe cases of covid-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods guan et al 2020 elderly individuals along with those with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension cancer cardiovascular diseases diabetes mellitus and acute kidney injury have a demonstrated higher risk for developing more severe cases of covid-19 as well as suffering a higher risk of mortality wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 the collision between the two global pandemics of covid-19 and type 2 diabetes t2d has led to the grim reality that t2d is already the second most common comorbidity of covid-19 zhou et al 2020 however current evidence implicating t2d in worse covid-19 prognosis has mostly come from relatively limited-sized cohorts deng and peng 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 thus the clinical features of patients with t2d infected by sars-cov-2 remain to be comprehensively clarified in a large-scale analysis which is needed to more efficiently and precisely manage the treatment of such patientsit has been well established that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to infections in general and exhibit worse prognosis once infected compared to the non-diabetic population kumar nathella and babu 2017 xu et al 2019 such a higher susceptibility has also been previously observed for other coronaviral epidemics for example in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pre-existing t2d was independently associated with poor outcomes the percentage of known t2d history was significantly higher among patients who succumbed to sars than who survived booth et al 2003 yang et al 2006 further epidemiological studies also indicate that t2d was the primary comorbidity associated with severe or lethal mers-cov infections alqahtani et al 2018 and with regard to the current covid-19 pandemic several recent studies though with limited participants have already suggested that t2d is a common comorbidity and constitutes a higher proportion of patients with severe and icu-admitted cases of covid-19 than patients with mild symptoms deng and peng 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 these associations between diabetes and worse outcome in viral infections are not unexpected as hyperglycemia is detrimental to the control of viremia and inflammation aggravating morbidity and mortality in a variety of patients forbes et al 2018 however an overly rigid glucose control may increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia which can also lead to an increased mortality rodriguez-gutierrez et al 2019 consequently previous clinical trials examining the effects of glucose control on mortality have yielded conflicting results forbes et al 2018 van den berghe et al 2006 for individuals with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d a key challenge for clinicians is to improve outcomes in the face of uncertainty regarding the degree of glycemic management that should be maintained and any effects this might have on the benefits and risks of overall treatment thus detailed analyses of data from such patients is needed that links plasma glucose levels with clinic outcomes including mortalityin this report we performed a retrospective longitudinal multi-centered study from a cohort of 7337 confirmed covid-19 cases enrolled among 19 hospitals in hubei province china focusing on the association between plasma glucose levels and clinic outcomes in covid-19 patients with t2d in addition to a significant association between diabetic status and higher mortality rate in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d versus non-diabetic subjects with covid-19 our study indicated that well-controlled glycemia was associated with a markedly improved outcome of patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2dclinic characteristics were collected from a total of 7337 participants out of 9663 confirmed cases of covid-19 including 952 subjects with pre-existing t2d n  510 male 536 and 6385 non-diabetic cases n  2967 male 465 figure 1
 of the initial 9663 cases enrolled 2326 patients with covid-19 were excluded from the study including 1013 patients younger than 18 or older than 75 years old 872 patients without complete medical records 13 patients with acute myocardial infarction 5 patients with acute coronary syndrome 8 patients with acute pulmonary embolism 10 patients with acute stroke 11 patients with acute severe pancreatitis 9 patients with cirrhosis 37 patients with above stage 3 chronic renal insufficiency 7 patients with severe congestive heart failure 104 patients with pregnancy 227 patients with malignancy 7 patients with type 1 diabetes 2 patients with a history of gestational diabetes and 1 patient with drug-induced diabetes from the final cohort of 7337 covid-19 patients analyzed the prevalence of t2d was 130 which was similar to the nationwide prevalence of t2d in china about 109 wang et al 2017 the median ages were 62 5568 and 53 4063 in the diabetic and non-diabetic groups respectively table s1 the median body mass index bmi in patients with or without t2d was 247 220264 and 234 210260 respectively the median duration from the first symptom to admission was 10 days 619 for both groups the major symptoms for both groups were fever 718 cough 635 fatigue 323 and dyspnea 161 similar to the general population of patients chen et al 2020 guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 patients with t2d reported significantly higher incidences of fatigue 380 versus 314 and dyspnea 205 versus 154 compared to the non-diabetic group pre-existing hypertension 534 versus 197 coronary heart disease chd 137 versus 37 cerebrovascular disease 56 versus 15 and chronic kidney disease 49 versus 13 had higher frequencies in the t2d group compared to the non-diabetic group chest ct scans indicated that the incidence of bilateral lung lesion was higher 881 versus 804 in the diabetic group compared to non-diabetic patientswhile heart rate and respiratory rates did not show differences between the diabetic and the non-diabetic groups systolic blood pressure was modestly higher in the diabetic group 130 mmhg 120142 versus 126 mmhg 120136 lab findings showed that blood glucose bg level was much higher in the diabetic group compared to the non-diabetic group as expected 83 mmoll 62124 versus 52 mmoll 4761 with higher levels of hba1c 79 6895 versus 61 5766 patients with t2d had a significantly higher incidence of lymphopenia 445 versus 326 and higher ratio of elevation of leukocyte 113 versus 66 and neutrophil 172 versus 99 counts in peripheral blood relative to the non-diabetic individuals at the same time elevated serum markers indicating inflammation c-reactive protein crp 570 versus 424 and procalcitonin 333 versus 203 decreased kidney function creatinine 120 versus 50 and increased coagulation status d-dimer 505 versus 333 were found more frequently in the t2d group than in the non-diabetic group furthermore spo2 lower than 95 occurred more frequently in the diabetic group versus the non-diabetic group 188 versus 132 on admissionthe patients with pre-existing t2d received significantly more intensive integrated treatments to manage their symptoms of covid-19 than the non-diabetic subjects the former group registered a higher need for antibiotics 613 versus 569 antifungal drugs 25 versus 12 systemic corticosteroids 294 versus 228 immunoglobin 230 versus 177 anti-hypertensive drug 451 versus 211 and even vasoactive drugs 77 versus 22 oxygen inhalation 769 versus 612 noninvasive ventilation 102 versus 39 and invasive ventilation 36 versus 07 were also applied significantly more frequently to the individuals with t2d compared to the patients without t2d table s2during the 28-day follow-up period we performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis on various parameters starting from the time of admission to the hospital for each patient in the study we noticed that despite having received more aggressive treatment against covid-19 and the comorbidities the diabetic group had greater incidences of decreased lymphocyte counts and increased neutrophil counts as well as higher levels of serum interleukin-6 il-6 crp and lactic dehydrogenase ldh accompanied by higher bg levels compared to the non-diabetic group the bg level was also significantly associated with comorbid hypertension chd the incidences of decreased lymphocyte count and elevated neutrophil count and the levels of serum crp and creatinine in the entire cohort figure s1during the 28-day follow-up period starting from admission the in-hospital death rate was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing t2d relative to the non-diabetic individuals 78 versus 27 p  0001 table s3 the crude hr of the 28-day all-cause mortality in the diabetic group versus non-diabetic individuals was 290 95 ci 221381 p  0001 table s4 after adjusting for age gender and hospital site on admission the hr of the all-cause mortality between these two groups was 170 95 ci 129224 p  0001 table s4 we further adjusted for the severity of covid-19 and found that the hr of the all-cause mortality between these two groups was 149 95 ci 113196 p  0005 figure s2 table s4 we here did not adjust for comorbidities closely related to t2d including hypertension chd cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease as these diseases often co-exist with t2dfurthermore the individuals with t2d had a greater occurrence of ards 169 versus 72 acute heart injury 73 versus 30 acute kidney injury 39 versus 08 septic shock 38 versus 10 and disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 05 versus 02 than the non-diabetic group table s3 mixed-effect cox analysis indicated t2d was significantly correlated with the occurrence of ards acute kidney injury and septic shock with respective adjusted hrs of 144 95 ci 120173 301 95 ci 194468 and 195 95 ci 118320 after adjusting for age gender and severity of covid-19 among the patients table s4 our current study was based on the largest diabetic covid-19 cohort so far analyzed and the results were unequivocal to implicate diabetes mellitus in higher risk of death and other detrimental outcomes of covid-19 notably care must be taken in interpreting the significant difference in outcomes between diabetic and non-diabetic patients with covid-19 since there were notable differences in the covariate distributions between the two groupsthe pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the impact of t2d on covid-19 progression remain to be fully investigated in patients with diabetes pulmonary dysfunction involving lung volume pulmonary diffusing capacity control of ventilation bronchomotor tone and neuroadrenergic bronchial innervation have been reported fuso et al 2019 which may account for the propensity of poor outcomes in patients with covid-19 and t2d at the same time a dysregulated immune response caused by t2d is likely also responsible for the increased disease severity of covid-19 in patients with t2d as a higher ratio of lymphopenia and increased levels of neutrophils serum crp and il-6 were observed in the patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d in our study these findings dovetail with immune dysregulation observed in other coronavirus infection-triggered pneumonia kulcsar et al 2019 in an experimental model of mers diabetic mice had lower numbers of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages and cd4 t cells which was accompanied by lower levels of ccl2 and cxcl10 expression kulcsar et al 2019 furthermore t2d is associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system in different tissues candido et al 2002 considering sars-cov-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 to bind and gain entry to infected cells hoffmann et al 2020 lu et al 2020 and reduces the expression of ace2 kuba et al 2005 overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system may also contribute to the increased adverse risk in patients with covid-19 and diabetes in this respect application of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors may have therapeutic effect in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2damong the cohort with covid-19 and t2d there were 282 individuals with well-controlled bg 136 males 482 and 528 individuals with poorly controlled bg 298 males 564 the median bg level was much lower in the well-controlled bg group than the poorly controlled bg group 64 mmoll 5275 versus 109 mmoll 76143 figure s3 and the levels of hba1c in these two groups were 73 6682 and 81 72101 respectively the patients from the well-controlled bg group also had significantly lower incidences of lymphopenia 305 versus 496 lower rates of increased counts of leukocyte 63 versus 122 and neutrophil 107 versus 194 and elevated serum crp 475 versus 595 and procalcitonin 242 versus 350 the same pattern was observed for elevated aspartate transaminase ast 113 versus 204 and d-dimer 376 versus 554 table 1
 notably fewer individuals from the well-controlled group had spo2 lower than 95 compared to the poorly controlled group 126 versus 227 but other parameters between the two groups were not significantly different in particular these two groups had a median age of 62 5567 and 63 5668 respectively table 1 the difference of the median bmi between patients with well-controlled bg or poorly controlled bg was modest 250 239264 versus 232 210249 respectivelyother clinical manifestations including chest ct imaging and the incidences of major comorbidities were similar between the two groups on admission even so the patients with covid-19 and t2d with well-controlled bg acquired significantly less integrated treatments than those with poorly controlled bg there was a significantly lower frequency of pharmacological therapy in the well-controlled bg group versus the poorly controlled group including the usage of antivirals 628 versus 712 antibiotics 532 versus 665 antifungal drugs 04 versus 28 systemic corticosteroids 202 versus 349 immunoglobin 153 versus 265 and vasoactive drugs 25 versus 89 the incidences of oxygen inhalation 702 versus 835 noninvasive ventilation 46 versus 119 invasive ventilation 00 versus 42 and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 00 versus 08 were lower in the well-controlled group than in the poorly controlled group table 2
correlated with persistent lower bg levels the well-controlled group had higher lymphocyte counts lower neutrophil counts and lower serum levels of il-6 crp and ldh throughout the 28-day observation period starting from the time of hospital admission figure 2
 we further noticed that the in-hospital death rate was significantly lower 11 versus 110 in the well-controlled group relative to the poorly controlled group table s5 the crude hr for the 28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups was 009 95 ci 003030 p  0001 table s6 after adjusting for age gender the severity of covid-19 comorbidities and site effect the hr of the all-cause mortality in the well-controlled bg group versus the poorly controlled bg group was 013 95 ci 004044 p  0001 table s6 the e-value for the point estimate was 1487 with upper limit of ci at 397 further relative to the poorly controlled bg control the patients from the well-controlled bg group developed less frequent occurrences of ards 71 versus 214 acute heart injury 14 versus 99 acute kidney injury 07 versus 38 septic shock 00 versus 47 and dic 00 versus 06 table s5 after adjusting for age gender the severity of covid-19 site effect and comorbidities the respective hrs of ards and acute heart injury were 041 95 ci 025066 p  0001 and 021 95 ci 007059 p  0003 between the well-controlled bg group and poorly controlled bg group table s6a propensity score-matched psm analysis was further performed to avoid confounding variables that could have interfered with the association between bg levels and all-cause mortality due to the lack of reliable indicators for the severity of t2d we specifically included t2d-related comorbidities for matching since comorbidities are closely related to the severity of t2d these comorbidities included hypertension cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease chronic liver disease and chronic kidney injury we were able to match 250 patients from the well-controlled bg group to 250 patients from the poorly controlled bg group at a ratio of 11 and these 500 individuals were included in the psm analysis figure 1 by applying mixed-effect cox model using the hospital site as a random effect and adjusting imbalanced durations from symptom onset to admission the results consistently and significantly demonstrated a lower risk of all-cause mortality in the patients from the well-controlled bg group adjusted hr 014 95 ci 003060 p  0008 compared to those from the poorly controlled bg group figure 3
 tables 3
and s7 although stronger integrated treatment was applied to the poorly controlled bg group table s8 the robustness of the association between glycemic variability and mortality was further assessed with additional sensitivity analyses by using different matching variables the results in these sensitivity analyses were similar to the above analysis with hrs of 017 95 ci 005061 p  0006 in the first sensitivity analysis and of 016 95 ci 005058 p  0005 in the second analysis table s9 in the psm analysis the respective adjusted hrs of ards acute heart injury and acute kidney injury were 047 95 ci 027083 p  0009 024 95 ci 008071 p  0010 and 012 95 ci 001096 p  0046 between the well-controlled bg group and poorly controlled bg group table 3glycemic variability has been shown to be an important indicator and a possible risk predictor for death and other complications in individuals with t2d forbes et al 2018 the impact of hyperglycemia on the pathogenesis of viral-induced respiratory diseases remains unclear elevated bg level has been reported to increase the glucose concentration in airway epithelial secretion philips et al 2003 which may disrupt the defensive capacity of airway epithelia on the other hand too rigid glucose control increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia which can also result in an increased mortality rodriguez-gutierrez et al 2019 in this study we found that compared to individuals with well-controlled bg poor glycemic control in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d was associated with worse outcome involving increased need for medical interventions multi-organ injuries and higher mortalities in contrast to such patients in those with glycemic variability between 39 and 100 mmoll there was a significant association with reduced medical interventions major organ injuries and all-cause mortality the findings here provide direct evidence supporting the recent suggestions for clinical management of t2d during covid-19 bornstein et al 2020in conclusion t2d is an important risk factor for covid-19 progression and adverse endpoints and well-controlled bg maintaining glycemic variability within 39 to 100 mmoll is associated with a significant reduction in the composite adverse outcomes and death these findings provide critical insights into the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d and the possible avenues to improving their disease outcomesdue to the retrospective nature of the study and the unprecedented scale of the covid-19 pandemic this study has several limitations first all data were obtained from patient cohorts admitted in the 19 hospitals in hubei province china therefore the effect of bg control may be different among patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d in the outpatient setting or in ethnically or geographically diverse populations second we were not able to retrieve the pre-hospital status of t2d from the current cohort due to the urgent circumstance of the covid-19 pandemic the status of pre-hospital t2d could be significantly associated with numerous clinical parameters which are known independent risk factors for the poor outcomes of covid-19 including cardiovascular abnormalities and immunological dysfunction while we performed psm analysis to support the independent association of t2d with covid-19 pathology the influence from these cofounders cannot be fully excluded also given this lack of pre-hospital data it was not possible for us to access if bg levels changed as result of covid-19 progression andor severity third the number of the patients with t2d and well-controlled bg in this study was modest and might not be powered sufficiently to reflect the overall complexity of the general population therefore large-scale prospective cohort studies will be required in ethnically and geographically diverse cohorts to better understand the association and importance of bg control in the disease progression of covid-19 fourth given the retrospective nature of the study it was not possible for us to determine if active management of bg levels to a more normal range could ameliorate covid-19 severity or adverse outcomes finally individuals with type 1 diabetes were excluded from our analysis as there were too few of them in the initial cohort but it is possible that blood glucose control may also affect their outcomes during covid-19

intravascular coagulation dic was diagnosed according to the criteria published by the international society on thrombosis and hemostasis isth gando et al 2013 the primary endpoint of the study was 28-day all-cause death in covid-19 patients the secondary endpoints were occurrence of ards septic shock acute cardiac injury acute kidney injury or dicthe variables potentially confounding the association between bg and the outcomes of covid-19 were addressed using the propensity score-matching psm method waljee et al 2013 psm requires a complete set of variables for every patient randomly missing values of 10 selected parameters from noninvasive tests were therefore imputed the non-parameter imputation method missforest was applied and the estimation of the imputation error was 408 the bootstrapped cross validation was further applied and repeated 10 times for evaluating imputation performance on the training data after 10 more parameters were randomly introduced the missforest method yielded 411 iqr 191544 differences between the datasets before and after parameters were introduced the algorithm of the psm is as followslogisticp  lnp1-p  0  1x1  2x2   kxk p  e0  1x1  2x2   kxk1e0  1x1  2x2   kxk the p in this formula is the predicted probability of glucose control procedure and the beta value before each variable is the regression coefficient of that variablethe variables potentially confounding the association between bg and the outcomes of covid-19 were addressed using the psm method when evaluating the association of glucose control level and outcomes the psm cohorts were identified by balancing age gender fever cough dyspnea ct-diagnosed lung lesions spo2 breath frequency incidence of increased leukocyte count alt ast d-dimer creatinine crp procalcitonin and decreased of lymphocyte count as well as comorbidities hypertension coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease chronic liver diseases and chronic renal disease the propensity score a predicted probability of glucose change contributed by the above variables were estimated based on multivariable logistic regression model the matching ratio was at 11 for well-controlled bg versus poorly-controlled bg during the entire hospitalization exact matching with a caliper size of 005 was applied for all matching pairs according to the propensity scores evaluation of the balance between covariates was conducted by estimating standardized differences before and after matching only those with small absolute value less than 01 were considered qualified balancingthe robustness of the association between bg level and all-cause mortality was assessed by analyzing e-value in the mixed-effect cox proportional hazards model to address unmeasured confounders using the methodology of vanderweele and ding haneuse et al 2019 mathur et al 2018 vanderweele and ding 2017 two sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of propensity score-matched cohort analyses among all pairsall statistical analysis was performed using r-363 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria and spss statistics version 230 ibm armonk ny usa data with continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range iqr and data with categorical variables were presented as frequency rates and percentage  comparison between 2 groups was analyzed using students t tests normally distributed or mann-whitney u test nonnormally distributed for continuous variables comparison of categorical variables was analyzed by fishers exact test or 2 test generalized linear model glm was performed to evaluate correlation between the median of blood glucose and factors related to viral infection or glycemic control in patients with diabetes the risk for composite endpoints and corresponding hazard ratio hr were analyzed using cox proportional hazard model and mixed-effect cox model the cumulative rates of death were plotted by applying kaplan-meier method a difference with a two-side  less than 005 was considered statistically significantthe covid-19 pandemic caused by the sars-cov-2 virus has had an enormous impact around the world whilst every country has been negatively impacted regarding socioeconomic and health outcomes countries that have been most impacted based on infection and death rates include as at 24 may 2020 the united states with over 156 million confirmed cases and 94000 deaths spain with 235290 cases and more than 28000 deaths italy with over 229000 and more than 32000 deaths and the united kingdom with 257158 cases and more than 36000 deaths httpscovid19whoint it is clear that the health systems of even these relatively affluent countries have been stretched beyond their capacity for example a study in italy showed a large proportion of critically-ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu required mechanical ventilation and higher levels of positive end expiratory pressure with a mortality rate of 26 1in australia as at 24 may 2020 there have been 7109 positive cases and 102 deaths httpswwwhealthgovaunewshealth-alertsnovel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alertcoronavirus-covid-19-current-situation-and-case-numbers to put this in a comparative manner in australia there have been 4 deaths per million compared with 541 deaths per million in italy and 284 deaths per million in the united states httpscovid19whointearly information from china indicated that people most affected with covid-19 and requiring hospitalisation frequently had other co-morbidities including diabetes hypertension coronary heart disease cerebrovascular disease obesity and chronic kidney disease 2 3 moreover progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death was more likely to occur in people with type 2 diabetes 4 5 and this appears to be associated with obesity 6 adverse health outcomes such as respiratory and cardiac failure and death are thought to be mediated by a cytokine storm 7similar data are emerging from other countries that have been significantly impacted by covid-19 including italy 8 of note a recent article reported an association of lower mortality and better clinical outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and covid-19 with well-controlled blood glucose levels 3 thus glycaemic control appears to be an important factor for people with diabetes with covid-19 and their likely outcomesthe first covid-19 positive case in australia was confirmed on january 25th 2020 in a person returning from wuhan china 9 this was followed by a lag phase with a doubling of positive cases approximately every 7-10 days however by march 21st 2020 when covid-19 positive cases in australia exceeded 1000 with 7 deaths australia was clearly on the exponential part of the curve httpswwwhealthgovaunewshealth-alertsnovel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert australias success in flattening the curve is illustrated in figure 1
the crude case fatality rate and the proportion of cases requiring hospitalisation in australia both remain substantially lower than the corresponding values reported from many other comparable high-income countries of the total cases of covid-19 notified in australia 13 were admitted to hospital compared to 42 of cases reported requiring hospitalisation in the eueea it is noted that the higher proportion reported by eueea is affected by each countrys testing strategies with some european countries only testing hospitalised individuals for covid-19 the highest rate of hospitalised cases in australia was among the 7079 age group 107 per 100000 populations followed by the 8089 years age group 94 per 100000 the most commonly reported comorbid conditions among hospitalised cases were cardiac disease 19 diabetes 18 and chronic respiratory conditions 13 of the hospitalised covid-19 cases 19 were admitted to an intensive care unit icu with 50 cases receiving ventilation the most commonly-reported comorbid conditions among cases admitted to an icu were diabetes 26 and cardiac disease 21as at may 24 2020 the median age of cases who died was 80 years iqr 7486 years with 57 of the cases being male and 45 female the most commonly reported comorbid conditions among covid-19 deaths were cardiac disease 34 diabetes 26 and chronic respiratory disease 22the australian federal government took the unprecedented step of forming a national cabinet including the leaders of all state and territory governments to coordinate the response to covid-19 this included physical distancing and lockdown restrictions to reduce the spread of covid-19 infections the australian lockdown restrictions listed only 4 reasons people should leave their house shopping for essential items receiving medical care and provision of health care and support exercising with no more than one other person if undertaking work or study were not possible from home other measures included closing borders and curbing incoming international flights in addition there was closure of non-essential services including cafes and restaurants except takeaway services travel between states and territories was halted or severely restricted people who tested positive returned from overseas trips or who were in contact with a known positive case were encouraged to voluntarily self-quarantine for 14 days though this subsequently progressed to mandatory supervised quarantine in hotels for all travellers returning from overseas irrespective of covid-19 statusthe implementation of lockdown rules in australia caused panic buying exemplified by a shortage of toilet paper and pantry staples such as flour pasta and rice resulting in strict limits on individual purchases of these products stockpiling and localised short-term shortages of medicines occurred including insulin and diabetes-related products blood glucose and ketone test strips insulin pump consumables and cgm consumables these were resolved by restrictions to dispensing limits of certain medications and diabetes-related products and positive communication to people with diabetes to maintain their normal purchases and not stockpileschools were closed to all students other than for students of essential workers as schools in australia are under the jurisdiction of state and territory governments there was a varied response across the country to these measures and there was considerable confusion and concernmore recently the australian government released a covidsafe tracing mobile phone app and has encouraged all australians to download this app and linked this to relaxation of social distancing and shutdown measures interestingly there were some reports that this app may have interfered with some diabetes apps and devicesthere was a strong and well-coordinated response to covid-19 in the australian health system to prepare for the expected covid-19 patient influx into hospitals byreconfiguring wards - expanding or establishing new icus with separate facilities for those with and without covid-19setting up separate inpatient covid-19 screening hot wards that were separate from cold wardssetting up special fever clinics initially attached to the hospital but separate from other services and particularly separated from emergency departments 10
innovative ways of screening people such as the implementation of an on-line self-registration and self-screening tool 10 drive through screening and rapid through-put screening to allow hospital workers with mild symptoms to be screened and get back to work in 24 hourssecuring adequate personal protective equipment ppe including from pre-existing national medical resources stockpiles and providing training on specialised techniques for urgentsafe gowning upsuspension of non-urgent surgery and procedures in both public and private hospitalsarrangements between state governments and private hospitals for the latter to take covid and non-covid patients if and when requiredupskilling and education of appropriate staff in best practice in procedures such as intubation to minimise risk to health professionalscall-up of and short-term registration of recently retired healthcare professionals and senior medical studentslimitation or suspension of all non-urgent medical ambulatory or outpatient services including outpatient endocrinologydiabetes services with a focus on provision of services that would prevent emergency department presentationsadmissionscontact tracing those exposed to a person diagnosed with covid-19 and planning and currently implementing the covidsafe contact tracing appfast-tracking of approval and implementation of covid-19 related research studies with additional specific funding being made available by our national research funding agenciesimplementing telephonetelehealth consultations for most endocrinologydiabetes services including paediatric endocrinologythe provision of inpatient diabetes education and medical review by telephone where possible for patients admitted with covid-19 to reduce exposure to essential diabetes staff
other changes in hospital services included redeployment of some staff to covid-19 screening and service areas depending on local needs and staff skill-sets eg relative recency in icu or respiratory skills screening all staff patients and visitors entering through minimised access points with temperature measurements and questions regarding overseas travel fever any symptoms of being unwell and any contact with known covid-19 patients in many hospitals ward rounds were limited to two health professionals there were limitations to numbers of visitor to one or occasionally two including outpatient areas wards and delivery suites importantly as people in residential aged-care facilities are among the highest risk groups to covid-19 no visitors to those facilities were permittedchanges were required for the management and education of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and their families particularly when children were affected this included insulin stabilisation to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis dka and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia state hhs active high-risk diabetes foot disease diabetes and pregnancy as well as inpatient diabetes care children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes particularly those in dka and with fever were often treated as having covid-19 until swabs proved they were negative as indicated there has been a rapid adoption of telephonetelehealth diabetes services to ensure continued diabetes outpatient care provided by the public hospital system it is important to note the major disruption and changes to the business processes of many allied health services including primary care optometry dentistry podiatry and dietetic servicesthe australian government provided covid-19 specific support to primary and specialist care services by establishing a national call centre supporting general practice-led respiratory clinics and providing online infection prevention and control training 11 with respect to telehealth consultations and to ensure continuity of care the australian government broadened access to its universal access scheme the medicare benefits scheme mbs by creating telephonetelehealth item numbers for health professionals including general practitioners and consultant endocrinologists there was also removal of the previous requirement that the patient lived at least 15 km distance from the health professionals practice to access telehealth reimbursement importantly and for the first time mbs item numbers for telephone in addition to video conferencing consultations were made available to more allied health professionals including credentialled diabetes educators in order to limit the need for patients in isolation to contact their doctor or pharmacy the doctor was able to issue a medication prescription without physically seeing the patient and send that through to the patients pharmacy which could then courier the medication to the patients home home delivery of medications by pharmacies was also made available for vulnerable people for example the elderly and those with disabilitiesthe national diabetes services scheme ndss is an initiative of the australian government that commenced in 1987 and is administered by diabetes australia the ndss provides universal access for australian residents with diabetes to subsidised products including blood glucose test strips urine test strips insulin pump consumables and for an eligible subset continuousflash glucose monitoring systems the ndss also provides useful statistical data on the numbers of people with diabetestype of diabetes and areas in which they residethe ndss provides information education and support services for diabetes self-management a dedicated national helpline and online information as well as face-to-face group education activities across the nation the ndss has wide reach and supports over 90 of all australians diagnosed with diabetes and includes all types of diabetes given the events unfolding overseas it was anticipated by many in australia that we were on the verge of a huge increase in covid-19 cases which would stretch our hospital and health care systemthe response to the pandemic in australia was swift positive and proactive to ensure that all people with diabetes had access to the medications products and services that they required and were aware of their greater risk of serious illness or death from covid-19 this was achieved by strong collaboration among the national diabetes organisations including diabetes australia australian diabetes society ads australian diabetes educators association adea australasian diabetes in pregnancy society adips the australasian paediatric endocrine group apeg and the juvenile diabetes research foundation of australia jdrfa with the australian government department of health leading the provision of coordinated and consistent information advice and communication about the covid-19 pandemicthe ndss wwwndsscomau has become a critical component of this response with the implementation of the following measuresenhancement of the ndss website to provide regularly updated and specific information and resources relevant to diabetes and covid-19extension of the contact hours of the ndss national helplinesupporting appropriate levels of access to medication supplies through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme including insulin and diabetes products insulin pump consumables reservoirs blood glucose and urine test strips through the ndss while there was no shortage of diabetes medicinesproducts in australia limitations were implemented to prevent stockpiling and localised shortagesa six-month extension for access to subsidised blood glucose test strips bgts was granted to eligible people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes this is instead of the usual requirement to consult with an eligible health professional to determine the need for an extension to the subsidysimplification of the usual processes to register and gain access to subsidised diabetes products including insulin pen needles bgts continuousflash glucose monitoring systems ndss registration and the national gestational diabetes registercontinuous glucose monitoring starter kits sent if requested to the residential address of the person with diabetes rather than to the health professional
the australian diabetes health professional organisations proactively responded to the covid-19 pandemic by establishing covid-19 specific web-pages to house educational resources for health professionals furthermore each organisation provided communication and updates to their respective membership via electronic messaging as well as social media platforms including twitter and facebook covid-19 specific guidelines and resources that were developed and disseminated includeguide for the management of diabetes during the covid-19 pandemictelehealth and diabetes guidelineaustralian clinical triage guide for people with diabetes-related foot disease during the covid-19 pandemic with stratification according to the level of the pandemicstatement on modification to the gdm diagnostic process during the covid-19 pandemic with stratification according to the level of the pandemicinformation for families of children with type 1 diabetes regarding covid-19information regarding the symptoms of type 1 diabetes onset in order to prevent late presentationcovid-19 and diabetes specific webinars webchats and podcasts
as the peak body for people with diabetes diabetes australia was responsible for advocating and implementing the changes to the ndss in response to the covid-19 pandemic in addition diabetes australia employed social media platforms including twitter facebook and linkedin to inform people with diabetes of the changes to the ndss as well as positive messaging about the importance of staying healthy and active an annual influenza vaccine very important because australia is entering winter and the usual influenza season and establishing a plan to manage their diabetes during any intercurrent respiratory or other illness diabetes australia also worked closely with national primary care health professional organisations such as general practitioner and optometry to support continuing access to these services for people with diabetesaddressing the mental health impacts stress and anxiety for both people with diabetes and other conditions and health professionals has been at the forefront of australias covid-19 responses people with diabetes are worried about being infected with coronavirus and what this means for their own health and well-being and also for that of their families and loved ones with the assistance of the australian centre for behavioural research in diabetes acbrd diabetes australia adapted a resource developed in wales to address this entitled managing worry about covid-19 and diabetes wwwndsscomauhealth professionals are concerned about becoming infected and infecting their immediate families not being able to perform their regular roles in patient care delivery and being seconded to covid-19 specific activities and about access to and use of ppe 12 these concerns were exacerbated by reports of covid-19 infections and deaths of overseas health care professionals there has been considerable advocacy for support and resources dedicated to health professionals to address the mental health issues that inevitably ariseit is clear that people with diabetes are at greater risk of serious health impacts in pandemics such as covid-19 than people without diabetes 13 14 as highlighted effective management of blood glucose in people with diabetes and covid-19 will lead to better outcomes and lower mortality rates 15 16whether the resources that were developed and measures that have been implemented had a positive effect on the health outcomes for people with diabetes is not yet known feedback from people with diabetes and health professionals has been positive and supportive of the proactive approach to this unprecedented pandemic australian healthcare professionals and researchers are also proactive in proposing and participating in national and international covid-19 related researchin australia diabetes health professionals have been supported with telephone and telehealth consultation incentives and guidance with respect to blood glucose management and medication use including specific information around the use of metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors sglt2i as well as related cardiometabolic medication such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceiangiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs for blood pressure management people with diabetes have been discouraged from stockpiling diabetes productsmedications to continue their diabetes care and monitoring with their diabetes health professionals to be prepared for any intercurrent illness and to optimally manage their glycaemia and health in generalmany changes have been necessary to maintain access to ongoing diabetes care and to provide effective communication to the australian diabetes community and health professionals learnings in australia from the covid-19 pandemic suggest that swift and proactive action is required to support both people with diabetes and health professionals to safely and appropriately modify health service delivery interventions are required to manage diabetes medicine and product supply chains the covid-19 crisis continues to provide a unique opportunity for leaders in the management of diabetes to share ideas collaborate and learn from each otherit will be important to assess the changes made in relation to diabetes care that have resulted from the response to covid-19 and to determine which should be permanently implemented these changes include service delivery models reimbursement for telephonetelehealth for credentialled diabetes educators medical specialist services and primary care providers ultimately the learnings from covid-19 should help prepare australia for future pandemics or other major health crisesthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe rapid spreading of covid-19 globally has extensively brought many consequences on care particularly for patients who have comorbid conditions 12 diabetes ranked second as the most prevalent comorbidities 97 95 ci 69125 among covid-19 patients after cardio-metabolic diseases 134 people living with diabetes are at higher risk of having covid-19 infection and potentially experiencing more severe illness when infected 45 a meta-analysis from china reported that covid-19 patients with diabetes had twice the risk of intensive care unit icu admission 6 and it makes diabetes as independent predictor of icu admission or invasive mechanical ventilation in covid-19 patients 37 a recent systematic review also identified that covid-19 patients with diabetes is related to an increased risk of icu admission or 279 95 ci 185422 i2  46 p  00001 and higher mortality rate or 321 95 ci 182564 i2  16 p  00001 3maintaining good glycemic control is an effective approach to prevent covid-19 transmission in diabetic patients 78 however in many countries diabetes control becomes challenging because of the imposing government policy to control transmission such as social distancing and lockdown most diabetic people could experience barriers in accessing measures for controlling their glycemic level such as limited access to healthcare limited availability of fresh food and limited physical activity because of confinement 7 the covid-19 during pandemic affects diabetes management diabetes educators physicians nurses and other health care providers need appropriate and accurate information to facilitate diabetic patients in taking care of their diabetes amid the covid-19 pandemic therefore the aim of this paper is to provide a review on the appropriate diabetes management during the covid-19 pandemic for people living with diabetes in addition this review will identify particular care of diabetes in specific conditionsscoping review aims to draw key concepts of available literature in underpinning a research area this design was chosen because it provided a broaden scope of specific field the scoping review procedure proposed by arksey  omalley was used 9 this procedure suggests five steps for a rigorous review 1 identifying clear research aims and searching strategies 2 identifying appropriate research papers 3 selecting research paper 4 extracting and charting the data 5 summarizing analyzing and presenting the outcomes on reportliterature search was conducted extensively by searching in several databases two authors alw and nsh performed independently search on pubmed science direct directory of open access journal doaj and microsoft academics databases for literatures published between january 1 and april 17 2020 the keywords were adopted from medical subheading mesh and used boolean to improve sensitivity the following search terms adopted from mesh were used covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and diabetes mellitus only english literatures were included for review non-scientific publication correspondences news and commentary were excludedthe outcome of two independent searches was compared difference finding were communicated and discussed until the same numbers of articles were reported duplicated articles were removed excel spreadsheet was used to short-list the articles during selection procedure seven articles were included for review after screening and checking eligibility the preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analysis prisma was used as guidance in reporting the searching process fig 1
 10included articles were compiled and extracted in an excel worksheet the extracted data included title authors and date of publication country and region research objective study design target of study sample size study setting data collection key findings research domains and subdomainsall the included articles were categorized into two domains ie diabetes management and specific consideration diabetes management refers to all actions to treat manage and cope with disease process of diabetes specific consideration concerns on such particular situation that requires thoughtfulness of care diabetes management domain was further classified into six sub-domains ie glycemic control and monitoring dietary intake physical activity medication education and prevention specific consideration was classified into sub-domains of diabetes in children and adolescents pregnancy older people and emergency or critical caremethodological characteristics of the articles were also evaluated using excel spreadsheet each article will be assessed about the study design target of study sample size and setting then the data were classified and presented in the percentagemost articles were published in journal of diabetes and metabolic diseases 8571 n  6 followed by medical virology journal 1429 n  1 the majority of articles were from asian region 5714 n  4 followed by european and american region 2857 n  2 1429 n  1 respectively all articles discussed diabetes management domain and only 7143 provided information for specific consideration domain fig 2

information of data extraction is available in table 2
 all included articles covered research domains and subdomains through presenting main findings although some included articles did not provide detail information of study design sample size and data collection the articles were analyzed and presented since it covered the research aimsall diabetic patients must maintain glycemic control and monitoring during the pandemic patients with diabetes could potentially find difficulties for glycemic control and monitoring during the lockdown or quarantine they could have problem on getting an access to medicine and glycemic monitoring materials including glucose strips glucometers and needles thus it is recommended for diabetic patients to early purchase the glycemic monitoring materials and medicine through online 278 a tailored glycemic monitoring for diabetic patients could be adjusted by considering age existing comorbidity clinical manifestation and other risk factors 8 glycemic monitoring using capillary blood test is acceptable for people living with diabetes during pandemic 27all hospitalized covid-19 patients with diabetes should undergo closed glycemic control and routine blood glucose monitoring previous research indicated that covid-19 patients with diabetes were associated with the poor outcomes of health 37 when they are discharged blood glucose monitoring is highly recommended amid a 4-week follow up after discharge and they have to avoid exposure to infection 8timing for glycemic control and monitoring can be adjusted for particular occasion during pandemic fasting and postprandial blood glucose in diabetes patients who consume oral anti diabetic agents with tolerable outcomes ie stable blood glucose record or fasting blood glucose less than 125 mgdl or hba1c less than or equal to 65 could be performed once or twice a week meanwhile for diabetes patients who administer insulin with poor outcomes or intermittent hypoglycemia blood glucose should be checked at least four times a day ie fasting pre lunch pre dinner and bedtime any sign or symptom of occurring hypoglycemia is reason to immediately check capillary blood glucose all blood glucose checking should be recorded for a minimum of consecutive three days and communicated to health care providers through tele-consultation 27lockdown during covid-19 pandemic could affect patients dietary habit patients with diabetes may find limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables 27 and consume canned or packaged foods that are high in calories andor fats 2 healthy and balanced diet should be emphasized and encouraged by dietician to diabetic patients during the consultation 713the recommended calorie intakes for obese and non-obese diabetes patients are 20 kcalkg and 2225 kcalkg of ideal body weights with sedentary lifestyle respectively dietary advice should include low carbohydrate intake low fats intake and optimal protein intake with no meal skipping 13 daily diet should be divided into three meals and a snackvariation of food composition is recommended consisting of 5060 complex carbohydrates 2545 fibers up to 30 fats 1 gkgday general patients or 08 gkgday nephropathy and macro-albuminuria of proteins the use of oils should be no more than 3 teaspoons a day and less than 5 gday for sodium intake patients could also use the diabetes plate method ie half plate of vegetables one-fourth of proteins and one-fourth of complex carbohydrates alcohol smoking and sugary sweetened foods should be avoided 7social distancing lockdown and home confinement require patients with diabetes to limit their activities or regular exercise however they could still have limited access to indoor and outdoor physical activities 2 home exercise such as treadmill stationary cycling or jogging and resistance training should be recommended 2713tailored physical activity while quarantine should be practiced about 60 minday the intensity and type of activities could be adjusted regarding individual patients condition the recommended physical activity is classified into three exercises ie aerobics flexibility workout and strength muscle exercises aerobic exercise with moderate intensity ie brisk walking treadmill stationary jogging or cycling dancing jumping sport aerobic and gardening is suggested for a minimum of 30 minday 713 if this is unachievable patients could take two or three times in small portion of aerobic exercise 1015 min climbing stairs household routine activities 7 or yoga practice as stretching technique 13 for 15 minday is recommended as flexibility training 713 a 11 steps of yoga pranayama for chronic condition could be implemented to enhance pulmonary function 17 a 15 min of squats push-ups sit-ups forward flexes or small weight lift as muscle training exercise every day is recommended as muscle training exercises 713 a physical activity for diabetes patients with heart diseases or hypoglycemia history should be noticed as particular circumstance 7health care providers need to assess patients adherence to medication through tele-consultation using valid but brief tools they also should make sure that all diabetes patients have sufficient medication stocks and prescribe enough medication because of limited access to clinic during the pandemic 7to date there is no robust evidence of anti diabetic agents in the context of treatment for covid-19 patients with diabetes though some anti diabetic agents indicate positive outcome of glycemic control reduction the application of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arb is hypothetically useful to treat covid-19 patients however there is still no data to support it currently the association of european and american cardiology and hypertension recommend ace inhibitors and arb to treat covid-19 although it lacks of evidence to support 2adjustment of sulfonylurea and insulin dose may be necessary to prevent hypoglycemia all diabetes patients should be provided information on adverse effects of anti-diabetic agents and encourage them to report any adverse effect 13 additionally it was reported that 449 non-icu and 722 icu patients with covid-19 received glucocorticoid therapy as daily treatment glucocorticoid was associated with hyperglycemia and induced more severe clinical manifestation recent review found that the use of glucocorticoid was not recommended to treat covid-19 pneumonia and could cause harmprevious reported covid-19 patients obtained a hydroxychloroquine therapy in a small-randomized trial covid-19 patients with mild signsymptom of pneumonia by ct scan received oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day for five days about 806 patients indicated improvement of covid-19 pneumonia and none developed severe covid-19 pneumonia among covid-19 patients with diabetes hydroxychloroquine works as hypoglycemia agent by decreasing hba1c and hyperglycemia 11 covid-19 patients with type 1 diabetes who receive chloroquine therapy is potentially experiencing hypoglycemia as its side effect chloroquine agent has hypoglycemia and immunomodulatory effects and therefore all patients should be closely monitored in diabetic animals chloroquine causes an increase in the level of insulin serum by providing a signal to cellular receptors and post-receptor clearance 12 all diabetic patients who receive hydroxychloroquine should obtain education on the contraindication such as diabetic neuropathy and history of seizure 7because of the covid-19 pandemic regular visit to hospitalclinic by diabetes is impeded type 1-diabetes patients should contact endocrinologists while type 2 diabetes patients are suggested to consult with internal medical specialists or general practitioners 57 it is recommended to conduct online or tele-consultation to keep in touch with the health care providers 78 endocrinologist could provide consultation by optimizing the use of smartphone application ie wechat whatsapps line to share educational videos e-books and recommendations 8 a previous meta-analysis showed that telemedicine practice during non-pandemic era by emails phones and videos for 360 months in china showed significant reduction of hba1c 037 p  0001 18 another cochrane review on telemedicine also indicated similar outcomes ie decline in hba1c of 031 p  0001 19 a recent review on 46 studies on telemedicine among type 1 n  2052 and 2 diabetes n  24000 patients showed significant reduction of hba1c 012 to 086 and 001 to 113 respectively 20a video mode of telemedicine is also recommended for the first consultation patients privacy confidentiality and consent from surrogates caregivers or patients should be maintained radiology laboratory findings and prescription should be integrated in medical records previous history of complaint allergy and hypoglycemia are of main concern identification of any noticeable neurological deficit is applicable by requesting patients to perform simple neurological test video or photograph could help when suspecting any lesion on foot abscess or visible wound all patients should recognize signsymptom of hypoglycemia and know how to treat it health care providers should always remind patients to do hand washing cough technique and social distancing as general precaution during tele-consultation when telemedicine or tele-consultation is not compatible face-to-face clinic visit is acceptable by considering time and place for preventing transmission of cavid19 telemedicine is also not doable for clinical examination and psychotropicnarcotic prescription 13as previously reported patients with diabetes are at higher risk for covid-19 infection in general diabetes patients should adhere to social distancing and home confinement policy as primary preventive method they should avoid contacts or exposure with confirmed covid-19 patients as much as they can it is recommended that patients with diabetes should arrange an individual plan of diabetes management while staying at home or getting sick they can make to a do list for dietary intakes physical activities and stress management during confinement all diabetes patients are strongly recommended to keep maintaining their glycemic control as part of risk reduction of infection andor prevent severe consequence of infection for confirmed covid-19 patients with diabetes 58all diabetes patients should visit hospital to consult with physicians or nurses when they are suspected of covid-19 infection fever and cough dyspnea or pneumonia visiting a pandemic area and recent contact with confirmed covid-19 patients are factors for diabetes patients to be suspected as covid-19 infection when patients decide to go to hospital or clinic patients with diabetes should use facemasks they will undergo diagnosis procedure by taking samples from noses or throat 5in case of home confinement patients and families should adhere to the rules for affected or suspected people because it could help to prevent further transmission to other patients andor families the affected people should live in a single room with proper ventilation meanwhile other family members stay in different room if this is not applicable make sure to always keep a minimum 1-m distance from the affected person routine hand washing after any contact with the affected patient or the environment and use disposable paper towel or clean towel and replace it when it is getting wet after hand wash the affected person should use medical mask to cover nose and mouth all caregivers also need to wear full-covered medical mask when being in the same room with the affected person 5in child or adolescent with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes it is recommended to take face-to-face mode of consultation type 1 diabetes patients and families should visit diabetes clinic to initiate insulin administration health care providers should make sure that patients and families receive diabetes education with highlighted topic on insulin administration hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis signsymptom and management for the follow up of type 1-diabetes patients ketoacidosis test should be advised when experiencing hyperglycemia 13all patients with gestational diabetes should undergo face-to-face consultation for insulin initiation during their first visit patients should obtain tailored education related their diabetes and current condition for lifestyle management minor adjustment of insulin dose may be necessitated for follow up gestational diabetes patients using telemedicinetele-consultation 13all diabetic patients who are experiencing drowsiness vomiting chest pain short of breath limb weakness and altered sensory should be noticed as emergency situation 9 in addition diabetic patients with any foot lesion gangrene severe hypoglycemia gastroenteritis and any other infection related to covid-19 should be addressed for special condition all of these situations require hospitalclinic visit or admission 13 health care providers should make sure diabetic patients understand about those signssymptoms and take initial action to hospitalclinical appointmentfor confirmed covid-19 patients with diabetes who receive critical care intensive blood glucose monitoring should become priority of care adverse effect of drug reaction should be early identified 8 diabetes has noticed an independent factor of icu admission and raised risk of mortality rate 3711 it was reported that covid-19 patients with diabetes comorbidity had twice the risk to be admitted icu and receive critical care 3 other study described that covid-19 patients with diabetes contributed to 22258 of icu admission due to septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome as result of blood glucose variability and elevated blood pressure 811 the mortality risk of covid-19 patients with diabetes is three times higher than non-diabetic patients 3 current reports noted the mortality rate of covid-19 patients with diabetes was 7376 811 thus all health care providers should more concern when caring covid-19 patients with diabetes during hospitalizationthis is a scoping review to provide broader scope of diabetes management and action for particular consideration thus there was no included level of evidence and quality evaluation in addition there was unclear methodological approach among included articles authors did not definitely express the method section three included articles did not provide clear information about study design and data collection process five out of seven included articles did not specify the sample size and one article used one-sample size case report the limitation on the included studies causes a limitation for this scoping reviewthis review produced a summary of diabetes management and specific considerations amid the covid-19 pandemic for diabetes patients patients and family members could use this review to deal with diabetes management concern on particular situations of diabetes and seek for help when needed health care providers and policy makers could take concern on review results to facilitate people living

publicationnot applicablenot applicablethe authors declare that there is no conflict of interestthe rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled sars-cov2 has become a global threat according to a meta-analysis of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles the prevalence of diabetes among people who were infected with sars-cov2 was estimated to be 791 diabetes could be a risk factor for severity and mortality in patients with covid-19 a study which included 72314 cases of covid-19 demonstrated that diabetic subjects had a threefold higher mortality rate than did those without diabetes 73 vs 23 2a recent commentary on diabetes research and clinical practice described the interplay between the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov another coronavirus responsible for an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 identified as a functional receptor for virus spike protein3 it has been interestingly hypothesized that dpp4 inhibition a therapy currently available for type 2 diabetes might represent a target for decreasing the risk of the acute respiratory complications of the covid-19 but unfortunately this hypothesis is on the basis of another hypothesis to the best of our knowledge no one has yet shown that dpp4 is a possible receptor for sars-cov2 on the contrary most recent data exclude this possibility confirming that human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov2 in analogy to sars-cov4dpp4 like the ancient roman god janus bifrons two-faced is a dual and multifunctional molecule it exists as soluble form sdpp4 in the circulation5 but also as a type ii transmembrane glycoprotein located on endothelial epithelial cells and immune cells cd266 dpp4 in the bloodstream and at surface membrane rapidly inactivates biologically active molecules as gastrointestinal hormones neuropeptides and chemokines but in some cases shifts their receptor preference and thus modifies their functional activity in addition to enzymatic cleavage cd26 executes other multiple physiological mechanisms as adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and it plays a co-stimulatory role in t-cell maturation activation and interaction with antigen-presenting cells thus dpp4 inhibition is associated with some degree of immune suppression and may be useful in some autoimmune diseases7 however in most patients long-term immune suppression albeit mild could represent an undesirable side effect8 we described a case of a type 2 diabetes subject with a severe leucopenia as a consequence of dpp4 inhibitor sitagliptin therapy9 in diabetic subjects treated with dpp4 inhibitors there is no increase in respiratory tract infections10 but we want to highlight that they could produce respiratory side effects as angioedema11 rhinorrhea12 cough and dyspnea13 as consequences of reduced degradation of bradykinin and substance pmers is another example of dpp4 ambivalence as expected human dpp4 transgenic mice following mers-cov infection develop an acute inflammatory response of the lung with progressive pulmonary fibrosis14 however hdpp4 mice were more resistant than hdpp4 mice to mers-cov infection as judged from increased ld50 reduced lung viral infection attenuated morbidity and mortality and reduced histopathology15 a possible explanation of this paradoxical protective effect of dpp4 against mers-cov is that the soluble dpp4 can act as a buffer competitively inhibiting virus entry into host cells in fact in human patients affected by mers there is a reduction in circulating levels of sddp4 with an inverse relationship with il-10 level in support of an antiviral effect of sdpp4 the authors demonstrated that viral infection was inhibited by 50 in the presence of more than 8000 ngml of sdpp416 another aspect to consider is the possibility that mers-cov downregulates its receptor after the binding dromedaries with experimental mers show reduction of the cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase17 likewise downregulation of ace2 receptor has been already demonstrated for sars-cov and sars-cov218 furthermore the human deficiency virus 1 hiv1 uses dpp4 as a receptor hiv-infected cells produce tat proteins that inhibit dpp4 activity inducing a decrease of responsiveness of human peripheral t cells19finally virus tropism is a complex phenomenon in the case of the coronavirus family while understanding the expression pattern of the receptor can define which cells can be infected it does not mean all cells that express the receptor or even the cells with the highest expression are the major targets in the case of ace2 the human lung is the 22th tissue for the amount of receptors20 probably is not only the spike protein that impacts on tissue tropism other background genes including nucleocapsid replicase and accessory genes are also important determinants of tropismin conclusion 1 lack of demonstration of sars-cov2 binding to dpp4 2 possible protective role of sdpp4 in mers 3 demonstrated inhibition and downregulation of dpp4 by hiv1 and mers-cov and 4 not exclusive role of the receptor binding in tropism of the coronavirus family support that dpp4 inhibition does not represent a plausible approach to mitigate covid-19
funding the authors did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papersince the end of 2019 a newly identified illness termed covid19 has spread rapidly through china and the rest of the world a novel betacoronavirus known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sarscov2 was identified as the covid19 pathogen which triggered severe pneumonia and acute even lethal lung failure
1
 by 2 march 2020 the virus had caused 80 303 confirmed cases and 2948 deaths in china and cases have been reported in 45 countries including the united states korea japan and italy in the existing cases some patients with sarscov2 pneumonia developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and a part of them worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure
1

angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 is the surface receptor for sars coronavirus sarscov directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein s protein
2
 a recent study suggests that the affinity between ace2 and the receptorbinding domain rbd of sarscov2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that with the rbd of sarscov indicating that ace2 might also be the receptor for sarscov2
3
 ace2 was reported to be widely expressed in various organ systems including the cardiovascular system kidneys lungs and brain4 5 which might provide an explanation for why some covid19 patients died of multiple organ failurediabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide and is anticipated to rise substantially over the next decades
6
 several investigations have demonstrated a higher susceptibility to some infectious diseases in diabetic people like staphylococcus aureus and mycobacterium tuberculosis7 8 9 probably owing to the dysregulated immune system
10
 it has reported that plasma glucose levels and diabetes are independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in patients with sars
11
 a retrospective study in wuhan china revealed that of the 41 covid19 patients 32 of them had underlying diseases and among which 20 was diabetes
12
 therefore these diabetic patients might be at increased risk of covid19 and have a poorer prognosisto figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor to influence the progression and prognosis of covid19 174 covid19 patients who were admitted to wuhan union hospital from 10 february 2020 to 29 february 2020 were included in this study according to the inclusion criteria their basic information laboratory examinations chest computed tomography ct scans as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed we found that as a common underlying disease in covid19 patients diabetes is associated with worse prognosisthis was a retrospective study of 174 patients with sarscov2 infection who were admitted to wuhan union hospital from 10 february 2020 to 29 february 2020 the enrolled patients in this study are all diagnosed with covid19 according to who interim guidance wuhan union hospital is a designated hospital for treating covid19 in the first part we divided all patients into two groups based on whether they had diabetes in the second part we excluded patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of other comorbidities and then the patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes were separated into two groups this case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of wuhan union hospital of tongji medical college huazhong university of science and technology written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital for the emerging infectious diseaseswe extracted demographic data medical history exposure history symptoms and signs laboratory findings chest ct scans and the treatment measures from electronic medical records the date of disease onset was defined as the day when the first symptom showed up clinical outcomes were followed up to 3 march 2020 all data were analysed by the research team and double checked by two physicians ys and lzlaboratory validation of sarscov2 was performed at wuhan union hospital throatswab specimens that obtained from the upper respiratory tract of patients at admission were stored in viraltransport medium total rna was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample rna isolation kit zhongzhi wuhan china sarscov2 was examined by rtpcr as described previously
12

all covid19 patients met the following criteria a epidemiology history b fever or other respiratory symptoms c typical ct image abnormities of viral pneumonia and d positive result of rtpcr for sarscov2 rna patients were divided into the diabetes and nondiabetes group according to their medical history furthermore ct imaging scores were used to quantify the pathological changes of covid19 patients the values were obtained by two physicians who were blinded to the patients clinical data using an introduced scoring system described as below
categorical variables were expressed as frequency rates and percentages  and continuous variables were expressed as mean sd if they are normally distributed or median iqr if not categorical variables between groups were compared using the 2 test or fisher exact test and continuous variables were analysed using students t test or mannwhitney u test as appropriate all statistical analyses were performed using the spss 130 software a
pvalue 05 was considered statistically significantof 174 hospitalized patients with covid19 the median age was 59 years interquartile range 4967 and 76 437 were men for the all patients the most common symptoms were fever 782 chill 684 cough 322 fatigue 27 chest tightness 259 shortness of breath 241 and myalgia 207 whereas nausea 98 headache 69 pharyngalgia 52 and chest pain 86 were relatively rare the most common of underlying comorbidities were chronic diseases such as hypertension 247 and diabetes 212 compared with patients without diabetes patients with diabetes had more cardiovascular disease 324 vs 146 and less fever 595 vs 832 but had no significant differences in gender and age as well as mortality table 1of all patients there were many typically abnormal laboratory test results table 2 including enzymes like hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase hbdh 190 iqr 146263 alanine aminotransferase alt 26 iqr2137 lactic dehydrogenase ldh 248 iqr 188362 and inflammationrelated markers such as creactive protein crp 177 iqr 734518 serum ferritin 3759 iqr 16957469 erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr 28 iqr 1359 il6 1175 iqr 51282 as well as coagulation parameters such as ddimer 067 iqr 0314 and fibrinogen fib 478 iqr 32858 in addition the absolute counts of lymphocytes 096 iqr 0713 and neutrophils 27 iqr 1846 also show abnormal changefurthermore we found that the absolute counts of neutrophils 41 iqr 2869 vs 25 iqr 1637 table 2 and the levels of crp 328 iqr 11393 vs 163 iqr 717439 esr 67 47581 vs 23 1049 as well as ddimer 115 iqr 083211 vs 054 02511 were significantly higher in diabetes group compared to nondiabetes group beyond that the absolute count of lymphocytes 086 iqr 0513 vs 097 07413 and red blood cells 39 iqr 3542 vs 417 3845 and the level of haemoglobin 117 iqr 1051235 vs 127 117136 table 2 were significantly lower in diabetes group compared to nondiabetes group these data showed that the covid19 patients with diabetes are at higher risk of excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state which may contribute to a poorer prognosis of covid19studies have shown that comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hypertension and malignancy may predispose to poorer clinical outcomes
13
 therefore we further explored the impact of comorbidities on the prognosis of the covid19 patients without diabetes and we found that levels of hbdh 208 iqr 1472645 vs 1415 iqr 124751505 alt 27 iqr 1947 vs 185 iqr 1324 ldh 281 iqr 196388 vs 1865 iqr 1772045 glutamyltransferase ggt 28 iqr 1755 vs 13 iqr 111525 and crp 254 iqr 118547 vs 743 iqr 3141345 serum ferritin 4345 26727104 vs 1289 572519315 esr 26 1358 vs 8 726 il6 137 iqr 58282 vs 413 iqr 3141061 as well as ddimer 067 iqr 032125 vs 025 022031 fib 479 iqr 3859 vs 375 iqr 304475 and the absolute count of neutrophils 25 iqr 1642 vs 254 iqr 205322 were significantly higher in comorbidity group compared to noncomorbidity group beyond that the absolute counts of lymphocytes 095 iqr 07312 vs 133 117163 and red blood cells 41 iqr 3744 vs 436 414464 and the level of haemoglobin 1255 iqr 1158136 vs 133 12013775 table s1 were significantly lower in comorbidity group compared to noncomorbidity group these data showed that the covid19 patients with comorbidity is at higher risk of tissue injuryrelated enzymes release excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state which may signifying a poorer prognosis of covid19 these results prove that comorbidities do have an impact on the progression and prognosis of covid19since our purpose is to explore whether diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of covid19 we next excluded patients with comorbidities other than diabetes to avoid the impact of other comorbidities on the results our findings are as follows compared with patients without diabetes patients with diabetes were older 61 iqr 5769 vs 32 iqr 3037 had more nausea and vomiting 167 vs 0 and higher mortality167 vs 0 but had no significant differences in gender and other baseline symptoms followup time as well as the time from onset of symptom to hospital admission between the two groups table 3on admission abnormalities in chest ct images were detected among all patients the prominent radiologic abnormalities were bilateral groundglass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation which is consistent with other recent reports
1
 the representative chest ct imaging of patients with or without diabetes were compared and the latter showed more severe pathological changes than the former figure 1a furthermore the severity of pathological changes was evaluated by the quantifiable score system described before we found that the diabetes group presented higher ct imaging score compared with nondiabetes group figure 1bit is worthy to note that levels of hbdh 181 iqr 1702045 vs 1415 iqr 124751505 alt 245 iqr 20253875 vs 185 iqr 1324 ldh 2505 iqr 18962925 vs 1865 iqr 1772045 ggt 20 iqr 157533 vs 13 iqr 111525 table 4 and figure 2 and neutrophils 4 iqr 23652 vs 254 iqr 205322 table 4 and figure 3 and crp 764 iqr 12493 vs 743 iqr 3141345 serum ferritin 7648 1641496 vs 1289 572519315 esr 76 5985 vs 8 726 il6 1373 iqr 7282831 vs 413 iqr 3141061 as well as ddimer 116 iqr 074189 vs 025 022031 fib 501 iqr 448625 vs 375 iqr 304475 were significantly higher in diabetes group compared to nondiabetes group beyond that the levels of total protein 60 iqr 548628 vs 677 63469 prealbumin 014 iqr 012018 vs 021 018023 albumin 354 iqr 2975387 vs 4145 39284343 and albglb 14 iqr 10516 vs 16 14817 table 4 and figure 2 as well as the absolute counts of lymphocytes 059 iqr 041089 vs 133 117163 and red blood cells 388 iqr 363416 vs 436 414464 and the level of haemoglobin 118 iqr 1075126 vs 133 12013775 table 4 and figure 3 were significantly lower in diabetes group compared to nondiabetes group these data showed that diabetes may contribute to a poorer prognosis of covid19further we analysed the effect of sarscov2 on the pathology of diabetes we found that patients with diabetes control blood glucose levels with insulin or oral medicine before admission among them 292 of the patients took insulin before and increased the dose of insulin after admission and 375 of the patients took oral medicine before admission and started insulin therapy after admission which meant that patients had poor glycemic control during hospitalization of all the diabetic patients only three had diabetic complications and those patients with diabetic complications were more likely to die as shown in table 5finally we explored the impact of comorbidities on the prognosis of patients with diabetes through our analysis although the indicators for diabetic patients with other comorbidities are slightly higher than those without other comorbidities no matter evaluated from organ damage inflammatory factors or hypercoagulability other comorbidities have little effect on the prognosis of patients with diabetes table s2common perceptions associate diabetes with a generally increased mortality and morbidity to infectious diseases although epidemiologic data that would prove this are surprisingly scarce however it seems to be confirmed that diabetes predisposes to certain types of infection and death6 7 8 9 11 but it is still unknown whether diabetes is a risk factor for the prognosis of covid19 type 2 diabetes is widely viewed as a chronic lowgrade inflammatory disease caused by longterm immune system imbalance metabolic syndrome or nutrient excess associated with obesity14 15 obesityassociated inflammation is characterized by an increased abundance and activation of innate and adaptive immunity cells in adipose tissue along with an increased release of inflammatory factors and chemokines locally and systemically
16
 on the other side data from human and animal studies suggest that some viruses are diabetogenic
17
 jali et al
18
 reported two individuals presenting with acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for a brief and transient period after being infected with chicken pox and in a study of sars yang et al
11
 found that even in nonsevere patients who have not been treated with glucocorticoid drugs their fasting blood glucose levels are higher another study found that the immunostaining of ace2 protein is strong in islets but weak in exocrine tissues which means coronavirus might cause diabetes by damaging islets seriously
19
 since viral infection may cause sharp fluctuation of blood glucose level of diabetes patients which adversely affect the recovery of patients there is a reason to suspect that diabetes combined with sarscov2 pneumonia may form a vicious circle which is detrimental to the prognosis of covid19reports showed that icu patients nonicu patients and recovery patients differ in ct imaging results which means ct results can be used as one of the indicator for determining the severity of the sarscov2 pneumonia
20
 according to the quantifiable score we found that the diabetes group presented higher ct imaging score compared with nondiabetes group which means pneumonia in diabetic patients is more severe than nondiabetic patientsin addition to imaging results laboratory results also give us some hints biochemical results showed that some indicative enzymes were abnormally elevated in the blood of patients with sarscov2 pneumonia including ldh hbdh alt and ggt which indicated the injury of myocardium kidney and liver this result is consistent with the extensive distribution of sarscov2 receptors ace2
5
 and can also partially explain why some patients died from multiple organ failure
1
 it is important to note that the levels of these enzymes were even higher in patients with diabetes when compared to patients without diabetes which give us a clue that the injure of organs was much more serious in diabetes patients group than those without diabetes in addition our study found that the levels of total protein albumin prealbumin and haemoglobin are significantly lower in patients with diabetes compared to individuals without diabetes which means diabetes patients are more likely to be undernourishedaccording to a recent report after analysing 138 hospitalized patients with covid19 they found that neutrophilia related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion coagulation activation related to sustained inflammatory response and acute kidney injury related to direct effects of the virus might be associated with the death of patients with covid19
12
 and other study also found that patients with sarscov2 pneumonia especially those with severe pneumonia have significantly reduced lymphocyte counts and significantly increased inflammatory factors such as il6
20
 in fact in the advanced stage of sars and ebola virus infections cytokine storms are also the main cause of eventual death for many patients in our study we found that compared to patients without diabetes absolute count of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with diabetes is significantly lower while the absolute count of neutrophils is remarkably higher furthermore the serum levels of some inflammationrelated biomarker are much higher compared to those without diabetes such as il6 serum ferritin esr and crp its noteworthy that for diseases that can induce a cytokine storm il6 is a very good predictor of disease severity and prognosis and its expression time is longer than other cytokines tnf and il1
21
 in addition a significant rise in serum ferritin indicates the activation of the monocytemacrophage system which is a crucial part of inflammatory storm these results indicate that patients with diabetes are susceptible to form an inflammatory storm which eventually lead to rapid deterioration of covid19during the inflammatory storm the ddimer increases significantly in the early stage this is the result of inflammation activating plasmin however as inflammation progresses and the presence of hypoxia hypoxiainduced molecules can activate thrombin directly and the activation of monocytemacrophages would also secrete a mass of tissue factors and activate the exogenous coagulation pathway which lead to an overall hypercoagulable state or even disseminated intravascular coagulation in our study we found that level of ddimer and fib was significantly higher in patients with diabetes which indicate that they are more prone to a hypercoagulable state than patients without diabetesclinical medication showed that the insulin dose increased after the patient was infected with sarscov2 which shows that the virus has an impact on the patients glucose metabolism dysregulation of glucose metabolism will aggravate diabetes and then affect the severity of pneumonia which works as an amplification loop meanwhile the diabetic complications signify the severity of diabetes and these patients with diabetic complications showed a higher mortality rate which further proves that diabetes is a risk factor for the prognosis of covid19 and the severity of diabetes is positively correlated with the poor prognosisall in all whether interference from other comorbidities is present or not we found that sarscov2 pneumonia patients with diabetes are more severe than those without diabetes evaluating from organ damage inflammatory factors or hypercoagulability and are more likely to progress into a worse prognosis therefore diabetes might could be considered as a risk factor for the outcome of sarscov2 pneumonia and more intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes in case of rapid deteriorationthe authors declare that they do not have any conflict of interest regarding this publicationdesheng hu and shanshan luo designed the study weina guo mingyue li yalan dong haifeng zhou zili zhang chunxia tian and renjie qin researched data weina guo and mingyue li contributed to the data analysis weina guo mingyue li yalan dong keye du haifeng zhou and zili zhang contributed to the discussion weina guo and mingyue li wrote the manuscript haijun wang yin shen lei zhao heng fan shanshan luo and desheng hu reviewededited the manuscriptwithin the space of 3 months severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 or covid19 has become a global household entity the speed with which covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who sent each country scrambling to review emergency healthcare provisions there is global evidence of each nation struggling to effectively manage the number of people being diagnosed with the virus covid19 is a novel rna virus that has previously not been identified in humans it is a virus that mainly affects the respiratory tract causing characteristic symptoms of a fever dry cough and dyspnoea with a significant risk of severe complications including requiring intensive care unit support presenting with acute respiratory syndrome and death in certain patients
1
 these are testing times which have not been experienced in recent generations and there are a number of insecurities regarding the management of people with covid19 the uncertainty in appropriate treatments that has ensued is adding to anxiety amongst healthcare professionals hcps however we need to rely on current systems and on hcps to continue to provide advice in terms of the therapeutic uncertainty and potential adverse harms associated with therapy when managing people particularly those with cardiometabolic diseases who have contracted or are at increased risk of contracting covid19 this will help in patient care and build trust within this setting the objective of the present brief report was to summarize and guide clinicians on the interaction of the management of people with covid 19 with the therapies used in cardiometabolic diseasesa systematic review and metaanalysis of clinical imaging features and outcomes in confirmed covid19 cases in a whole population analysed 18 studies with the mean age of the patients in the studies being 5197 years and 559 being male of these 368 had comorbidities with the most significant being hypertension 186 cardiovascular disease cvd 144 and diabetes 119
1
 diabetes is associated with multimorbidity with 90 of people with type 2 diabetes having at least one chronic condition and 25 having four or more chronic conditions
2
 hypertension is the most common supplementary condition affecting twothirds of people with type 2 diabetes as expected as the number of chronic conditions increased there was a significant increase in polypharmacy with more than half the patients with type 2 diabetes being prescribed six or more medications regarding covid19 there have been concerns that there is increased mortality in patients with cvd diabetes hypertension and cerebrovascular disease the study based on 44 672 confirmed cases in china showed that the case fatality rate was 23 1023 deaths in the general population compared to 105 in those with cvd and 73 in those with diabetes
3
 a further study showed that the most common comorbidities in 140 hospitalized patients with covid19 were hypertension 30 and diabetes 121
4
 these patients therefore need advice from hcps regarding treatment for their multimorbidities require strict isolation measures and may even require special attention if infected with covid19the majority of patients with diabetes also have hypertension and there have been recent claims regarding the use of the antihypertensive agents known as angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs along with other medications such as corticosteroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications and the associated risks of adverse effects in patients with covid19 nhs england and other health authorities have issued statements regarding the use of these medications ace inhibitors and arbs have been implicated as factors to acknowledge in those patients with poorer outcomes attributable to sarscov2 binding to target cells through ace2 receptors
5
 these medications have been shown to upregulate ace2 in animal studies and therefore there are concerns that patients taking these medications are at an increased risk of developing more severe coronavirus infections
6
 perico et al
7
 have stated however that evidence suggests ace2 receptors in the lungs may play a protective role in covid19 furthermore the european society of hypertension the european society of cardiology and a joint statement from the american college of cardiology the american heart association and the heart failure society of america have also advised treatment with ace inhibitors and arbs to continue as per usual guidelines in patients at risk for covid19 or in those already diagnosed with covid198 9 10 currently there are no reliable experimental or clinical data available to suggest otherwise and they warn about the risk of stopping these medications suddenly causing acute heart failure and worsening of blood pressure
10
 furthermore discontinuation of these drugs and the associated risk of exacerbating heart failure thus causing symptoms such as breathlessness will in turn raise anxieties and cause ambiguity as to whether symptoms are infectionrelated or attributable to the chronic health conditions
11

in people with diabetes it has been advised that hcps be aware that these patients are at an increased risk of metabolic decompensation and that if patients are managed at home hcps need to ensure they have an increased supply of monitoring equipment for glucose and ketones adequate medication supplies and information regarding following stringent social distancing measures
12
 furthermore metabolic acidosis has been shown to be a risk in patients with severe covid19 infection
13
 this is a particular risk in patients with diabetes on metformin as metformin can exacerbate lactic acidosis it has previously been suggested that patients at an increased risk of lactic acidosis should suspend their metformin during their inhospital stay and provided with adequate insulin treatment
14
 similarly patients on sodiumglucose cotransporter2 inhibitors who are infected by covid19 are at an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis dka and it has therefore been recommended that the medication is temporarily stopped if unwell hcps should inform patients of signs and symptoms of dka and should also emphasize strict adherence to sick day rules
15

poor glycaemic control in patients with or without covid19 is associated with an increased risk of infections especially in the elderly because of the increased risk of complications infections associated with diabetes include respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis despite the current lack of evidence of the association of high glycated haemoglobin and increased risk of covid19 infections of or complications this may put people with diabetes at increased risk of covid19 and therefore good glycaemic control and medication adherence is vital
16
 people with diabetes and hypertension have multimorbidities which is associated with poor medication adherence one metaanalysis of eight studies regarding the association between poor medication adherence and excess mortality in chronic disease showed a mean rate of poor adherence of 378
17
 the study also showed that good adherence was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes
17
 hcps therefore need to address this issue especially during these times when patients are anxious which is associated with poor adherence a metaanalysis of 31 studies concerning depression and medication adherence in the treatment of chronic diseases showed that there was a 176 times increased risk of a depressed patient nonadhering to treatment
18
 patients with diabetes and mental illness may therefore experience a decompensation of their mental illness due to covid19 and this may result in decreased medication adherence these patients need to be reassured and encouraged by hcps to take their medications even with remote consultations or using mobile phone technologies to improve adherence advice needs to be given regarding how stopping these treatments will lead to further morbidity and mortality additionally there have also been reports of patients with lifethreatening conditions such as myocardial infarction delaying medical attention due to the covid19 outbreak
19
 it is paramount to address these issues and ensure appropriate management of patients with chronic conditions especially those associated with high mortalityfor corticosteroid use in previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome merscov corticosteroids were used extensively
20
 nonetheless the who has given guidance against the use of corticosteroids in covid19 because of the possibility of further harm unless these medications are needed for other health conditions
21
 therefore those with adrenal insufficiency such as addisons disease or secondary adrenal failure should continue to take medication and to follow sickday rules if they become unwell without delay
22
 more importantly they should also follow social distancing measures indefinitelywe are still in the early phases of clinical trials and future research into the use of the medications above along with others will hopefully be undertaken quickly to assist in these distressing times the national institute for health and care excellence nice has recently published the first rapid covid19 guidelines to help maximize safety for patients and staff there is also some positive evidence on the use of certain medications in the treatment of covid19 including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a systematic review concluded that chloroquine appears to be effective in preventing sarscov2 replication and that based on its known safety clinical research on chloroquine in patients with covid19 is justified
23
 one small study showed that hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with viral load reductiondisappearance in covid19 patients and its effect was reinforced by azithromycin
24
 we must however proceed with caution with the use of hydroxychloroquine until further data become available as patients with sarscov2 complications can present with hypotension tachycardia bradycardia arrhythmia or even sudden cardiac death
25
 these may also be associated with hydroxychloroquine since it can prolong qtc interval particularly in patients with heart failure and previous myocardial infarction it would therefore be advisable to periodically monitor ecg during this treatment
26

copcov is a randomized controlled trial that will be assessing chloroquinehydroxychloroquine prevention of coronavirus disease in the healthcare setting httpclinicaltrialsgov nct04303507 this will hopefully provide more data to reassure clinicians about the benefits and safety of this agent patients with diabetes will also need to be carefully monitored as there is recent evidence from a systematic review that hydroxychloroquine has potential antidiabetic properties with the potential risk of hypoglycaemia this in turn is associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia which is associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality
27

whilst these treatments are still in exploration it is most important at this time that patients on cardiometabolic and endocrine medications are supported and encouraged to adhere to treatment regimes obtain support to reduce mental health issues and are advised to adhere to lifestyle recommendations to reduce the risk of other detrimental health effects and further unnecessary admissions to the already overstretched healthcare systemthe authors declare no conflicts of interestidea proposal by kk sk and nk composed the initial draft ss reviewed and corrected the draftcoronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a global pandemic that initially started in wuhan china and spread extremely quickly making its way to over 180 countries as the novel coronavirus continues to evolve there are still many limitations to our knowledge of who exactly this virus would impact critically older adults and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes have shown worse prognosis 1 diabetic patients have increased morbidity and mortality rates and have been linked to more hospitalization and intensive care unit icu admissions 1 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd or any respiratory illnesses are also at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 2 the risk of contracting covid-19 in patients with copd is found to be 4-fold higher than patients without copd 2a retrospective study of middle-aged and elderly patients with covid-19 found that the elderly population is more susceptible to this illness and is more likely to be admitted to the icu with a higher mortality rate 3 the age-related changes in the geriatric population may be due to the changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy which results in changes in physiologic function reduction of lung reserve reduction of airway clearance and reduction of the defense barrier function 3the clinical outcomes and length of stay directly correlate with the underlying conditions and age of the covid-19 patient researchers in china studied 344 patients in the icu with covid-19 of the 344 subjects 133 patients died on the 28th day with a median survival of 25 days 4 of these patients there were many with different comorbidities with 141 patients having hypertension 4 in survivors the median duration of hospitalization for a negative test result was 12 days 4 furthermore another study conducted in china studied 633 covid-19 patients of whom 247 patients had at least one comorbidity and that concluded that older individuals greater than 60 years were more likely to exhibit a more severe form of covid-19 disease 5 during the study 25 patients with a median age of 693 years died giving an effective mortality rate of 377 5it has been concluded that the older the patients are the more likely they are to succumb to the covid-19 disease in the usa the centers for disease control and prevention cdc uses covid-net in 14 states to monitor the demographics of covid-19 patients who are being hospitalized 6 from march 1 through 30 2020 there were a total of 180 patients on covid-net of which 893 of the patients had an underlying comorbidity 6 of the 180 patients 944 aged 65 years and older had at least comorbidity 6 the most common comorbidities found were obesity hypertension and diabetes mellitus 6 the purpose of this paper is to review these comorbidities given that most patients with severe covid-19 cases had comorbidity furthermore we would like to examine specific comorbidities in relation to the covid-19 disease progression and outcomes based on the literature report since the outbreakan electronic literature search was performed using pubmed google scholar ebscohost mendeley and medline plus the search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published from january to april 20 2020 an article was selected if it included keywords such as coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 clinical features comorbidity diabetes and hypertension articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topicconfirmed and reported cases of covid-19 have a wide range of symptoms from mild complaints such as fever and cough to more critical cases associated with difficulty in breathing 7 some of the most common symptoms include cough fever chills shortness of breath sob muscle aches sore throat unexplained loss of taste or smell diarrhea and headache 8 symptoms can start as mild and become more intense over 5 to 7 days worsening if pneumonia develops in patients 8 approximately 1 out of 6 infected individuals become seriously ill and develop difficulty in breathing especially in the elderly with underlying health conditions 9a meta-analysis study of covid-19 patients as depicted in fig 1 showed fever 888 as the most common symptom followed by dry cough 68 and fatigue 33 10 other symptoms noted were productive cough 285 sob 17 muscle pain 144 sore throat 114 and headache 102 10 the least common symptoms were diarrhea 44 nausea and vomiting 41 rhinorrhea 32 abdominal pain 016 and chest pain 011 10symptoms of covid-19 may appear anytime from 2 to 14 days after exposure therefore 14-day quarantine is recommended 7 the average incubation period for covid-19 is approximately 52 days 11 in wuhan china the most common symptoms observed from the onset of this outbreak include fever cough and fatigue while some features that were not so prevalent were sputum production headache hemoptysis and gastrointestinal gi symptom such as diarrhea 12 13 another study that was conducted in beijing china showed that the average age of patients with covid-19 was 355 years and had a mean of 35 days from the onset of symptoms to admission in the hospital 14 the same study also showed that fever was present in 875 of patients which persisted for 65 days and symptoms resolved 25 days after a negative test result 14some individuals who are infected do not develop any symptoms at all and about 80 of positive cases recover from the disease without any treatment 9 however there have also been instances of transmissions of covid-19 from one person to another before the person became aware of being sick or the symptoms were so mild that the person did not know heshe had the illness 15 it becomes essential to seek medical attention immediately if a person suspects that heshe may have been infected or is a confirmed case of covid-19 experiencing respiratory distress has blue lips is in constant pain or has pressure in the chest 7 also it is important to note that covid-19 is more infectious than sars-cov and mers-cov due to its numerous epidemiological and biological characteristics 16due to covid-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease the data available is limited however from the cases that emerged it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection 7 based on current information and clinical expertise the elderly especially those in long-term care facilities and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk of getting covid-19 7 the elderly a vulnerable population with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular or lung disease are not only at a higher risk of developing severe illness but are also at an increased risk of death if they become ill 15 people with underlying uncontrolled medical conditions such as diabetes hypertension lung liver and kidney disease cancer patients on chemotherapy smokers transplant recipients and patients taking steroids chronically are at increased risk of covid-19 infection 7a meta-analysis study on covid-19 comorbidities as depicted in fig 2 had a total of 1786 patients of which 1044 were male and 742 were female with a mean age of 41 years old 10 the most common comorbidities identified in these patients were hypertension 158 cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions 117 and diabetes 94 10 17 the less common comorbidities were coexisting infection with hiv and hepatitis b 15 malignancy 15 respiratory illnesses 14 renal disorders 08 and immunodeficiencies 001 10patients with moderate to severe asthma are at a disadvantage because this virus affects their respiratory tracts leading to increased asthmatic attacks pneumonia and acute respiratory distress 7 according to the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report 346 of patients aged 18 to 49 years old have an underlying chronic lung disease such as asthma 6 in iran a case study reported that genetic predisposition to covid-19 can increase the probabilities of getting infected with sars-cov-2 and can lead to death from this virus 18 this genetic predisposition was seen in 3 brothers in iran who were 6 years apart in age 54 60 and 66 years who died due to covid-19 despite no identified comorbidities and living separately from one another 18 as of january 2 2020 wuhan china had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 of which 73 3041 were men with a median age of 49 years old 66 2741 of these patients had been exposed to the huanan market 32 1341 had underlying diseases such as diabetes 20 841 hypertension 15 641 and cardiovascular 15 641 12 patients who are hiv positive along with a low cd4 count and not on antiretroviral therapy have a higher risk and incidence of other medical issues including covid-19 7 according to the international aids society ias people who are human immunodeficiency virus hiv positive taking antiretroviral treatment and do not have a low cd4 count will have the same risk of having covid-19 as one without hiv 19 20as depicted in fig 3 a population-based surveillance report via covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network covid-net reported clinical data on 1478 covid-19-positive patient hospitalizations from march 1 to march 30 2020 6 among the 1478 patients studied 12 of adults showed clinical data of underlying medical conditions with the most prevalent being hypertension 497 and obesity a close second 483 6 other medical conditions included chronic lung disease 346 diabetes mellitus 283 and cardiovascular diseases 278 6covid-19 can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization in icu and potentially death especially in the elderly with comorbidities 21 according to the cdc 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the usa occurred in adults 65 years old and above 7 roughly 80 of covid-19-positive cases result in full recovery from the illness without any hospitalizations or interventions 9 there are still many facts that we do not know about covid-19 due to gaps in knowledge therefore many studies are underway to better understand this virus 15wuhan china had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 from december 16 2019 to january 2 2020 and the clinical outcomes are shown in fig 4 12 of the 41 patients with confirmed covid-19 in the hospital 100 had pneumonia 29 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 15 exhibited an acute cardiac injury and 12 acquired a secondary infection 12 the majority of these patients 68 were discharged 17 remained hospitalized 10 ended up in the icu and 15 ended in death 12from february 20 to march 5 2020 a study was conducted in evergreen washington on the characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 diagnosis 22 this study showed that 71 of these patients required mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory arrest was seen in all of them 22 within 72 h of developing ards 53 of these patients showed increasing severity of respiratory problems leading to poor short-term outcomes and a higher risk of death 22 as of march 17 2020 the mortality rate was 67 in these patients with 24 critically ill and 95 discharged from hospital 22as shown in the cdcs mortality and morbidity weekly report in fig 5 case mortality increased as the patients age increased 21 23 among the age group  19 years no icu admission or mortality was reported 21 covid-19 has also been noticed in children but the disease took a more moderate course when compared with adults the prognosis was also seemingly better and deaths were infrequent 24on april 29 2020 who reported over 3 million confirmed covid-19 cases worldwide with over 200000 of these cases resulting in mortality 25 the majority of these deaths are within the usa with over 50000 followed by italy with over 25000 and spain with over 20000 25 new york is being hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus spreading across the usa with more cases and deaths per capita than any other state table 1 reports that over 86 of covid-19 deaths involved at least one comorbidity according to the new york state department of health 26multiple comorbidities are associated with the severity of covid-19 disease progression many of the poorer outcomes for covid-19 have been related to cardiovascular comorbid conditions 27 however this may be a direct result of the cardiovascular condition itself or attributed to other comorbidities along with a cardiovascular condition 27 patients with type 2 diabetes were also more likely to have increased severity of covid-19 28 in a cohort study of 7337 patients with covid-19 with and without type 2 diabetes it was shown that those with type 2 diabetes required increased interventions for their hospital stay versus those that were nondiabetic 28 it was shown that those with poorer blood glucose control had an all-around increased mortality rate than those with better glucose control 28 the study concluded that patients with blood glucose specifically those in the range of 39 to 100 mmoll had overall decreased composite adverse events and mortality 28 it was noted that poor blood glucose control resulted in a substantially increased risk of complications and death 28 among other comorbidities chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd has also been associated with poor disease progression a meta-analysis of multiple studies in china found that there was a four-fold increase in mortality in patients with preexisting copd that were diagnosed with covid-19 29 in this analysis the smoking status of patients and severity of covid-19 were also studied only one study was found to have an association with smoking and severe course of covid-19 29 after this study was removed there was no significant association with smoking and severe covid-19 disease 29patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure associated with the novel coronavirus may be linked to a prothrombotic coagulopathy 30 the autopsy of covid-19-related deaths revealed dispersed microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature demonstrating an occlusive etiology of respiratory failure 30 a 38 to 100 improvement was noted in three cases with covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and respiratory failure following treatment with intravenous iv antithrombotic alteplase 30 the results although reassuring were transient in two of the three cases with recovery succumbing posttreatment 30 the use of anti-thrombolytic therapy needs to be further studied to ascertain that the results are due to treatment and not chance alone 30 a retrospective meta-analysis including 1558 covid-19 patients was conducted until march 1 2020 on subjects with underlying comorbidities and the risk for acquiring covid-19 31 common comorbidities such as hypertension copd diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular disease were observed to be the more significant risk factors in subjects when compared with other underlying disease states 31 other than intense supportive measures a definitive treatment has yet to be identified 31 authorities speculate that subjects with comorbidities were linked to a more severe disease outcome when infected with the novel coronavirus when compared with patients with no underlying disease 31 the study was met with barriers due to the diminutive sample size and some subjects having more than one underlying comorbidity 31 in literature and earlier research underlying diseases increase the mortality rate in patients who acquired covid-19 with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most significant risk factors 32 once again insufficient sample size and inadequate time have led to limitations in the data collected 32over 180 countries have been affected by covid-19 resulting in mass death worldwide as cases evolve globally it has been noted that persons with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to contract the virus and become severely illdue to sars cov-2 being a relatively new virus the data available is limited however patients with comorbidities have more deteriorating outcomes compared with patients without covid-19 patients with history of hypertension obesity chronic lung disease diabetes and cardiovascular disease have the worst prognosis and most often end up with deteriorating outcomes such as ards and pneumonia also elderly patients in long-term care facilities chronic kidney disease patients and cancer patients are not only at risk for contracting the virus but there is a significantly increased risk of death among these groups of patientsof the cases reported worldwide symptoms of covid-19 ranged from mild respiratory disease to severe illness which requires intubation and mechanical ventilation since there is a period where the patient is asymptomatic and the incubation period is between 2 and 14 days it is difficult to establish an early diagnosis much less curb the transmission of the infection if the patient is unknowingly exposed however within this period if respiratory symptoms develop it is important to seek immediate caretherefore patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with sars cov-2 as they usually have the worst prognosis these precautions include regular handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer limiting person-to-person contact and practicing social distancing wearing a face mask in public places and overall limiting going to public areas at this time unless it is necessary hence there is a need for a global public health campaign to raise awareness on reducing the burden of these comorbidity illnesses causing deaths in covid-19-infected patientssince the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic began in china more than 10500 confirmed cases and about 220 coronavirus disease-19 covid-19-related deaths have been reported in korea as of april 14 2020 daegu city accounts for 78 of confirmed cases and 68 of deaths since the outbreak began in february 2020 recent studies have shown that advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus hypertension are considered as risk factors for severe illness and mortality among patients with covid-19 1acute hyperglycemic crisesdiabetic ketoacidosis dka and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state hhsare the serious acute metabolic complications of diabetes and commonly precipitated by infection covid-19 is also estimated to trigger acute hyperglycemic crises in patients with inadequately controlled patients with diabetes but the evidence for this association is still limitedhere we described two covid-19 cases compromised with acute hyperglycemic crisesdka and hhsduring the outbreak in daegu south koreaelectric medical records of index cases were reviewed and cross-checked by two independent physicians informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study and the analysis used anonymous clinical data this study was approved by institutional review board yuh irb 2020-03-057 of yeungnam university college of medicine daegu republic of koreaa 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital suffering from general weakness polydipsia polyuria and mild dyspnea for 4 days he had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm and hypertension but was recently discontinuing oral hypoglycemic

peribronchial ground-glass opacities in both lungs although there was no obvious flu-like symptom such as cough sputum sore throat or fever fig 1 covid-19 was confirmed on march 19 2020 on the basis of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay that detected sars-cov-2 therefore anti-viral agents lopinavirritonavir empirical antibiotics and symptomatic respiratory treatment for covid-19 infection as well as treatment for dka were also performed the dka was improved after proper insulin treatment but the dyspnea and radiologic finding worsened mechanical ventilation was initiated on the fourth day of admission he received intensive treatments such as continuous renal replacement therapy 6th day after admission and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 13th day after admissionon the 14th day of hospitalization acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed based on the elevation of cardiac enzyme and st segment on the electrocardiogram and percutaneous coronary intervention was performed however the patient did not recover from respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability and eventually died after 16th day of hospitalizationa 72-year-old woman was hospitalized for shortness of breath for 3 days before being transferred the patient was confirmed covid-19 using rt-pcr test with high oxygen demand she had a history of t2dm hypertension and dyslipidemia but had stopped taking oha for several days due to anorexia her skin was dry and tough upon physical examination her initial vital signs were within normal ranges but oxygen saturation was 90 in pulse oximetry on 6 lmin of oxygen maskupon hospital admission laboratory findings showed increases in plasma levels of glucose 690 mgdl effective osmolality 324 mosmkg and hba1c 126 respectively urine and serum ketone body was not detected abga on 6 lmin of oxygen mask showed ph 7381 hco3 181 mmoll and serum sodium and potassium were within normal range her chest radiograph showed multifocal patchy consolidation at both lung fields fig 2based on the laboratory and imaging results she was diagnosed with hhs and covid-19 treatment was immediately provided with intravenous fluid regular insulin anti-viral agents and empirical antibiotics hyperglycemia and dehydration were promptly improved after proper management but radiologic findings worsened with an increase in oxygen demand on the second day invasive mechanical ventilation with prone position was initiated a tracheostomy was applied on 15th days of hospitalization because the patients was not spontaneously breathing after 33 days of hospitalization subsequent covid-19 tests were all negative but she still needs support from a mechanical ventilatorherein we report two patients with acute hyperglycemia precipitated by covid-19 one case was in conjunction with dka and was fatal and the other had hhs and delayed recovery even after rt-pcr tests were negative to the best of our knowledge this is the first case report of covid-19 combined with dka and hhsemerging information suggests that individuals with diabetes are at increased risk for complications including death among covid-19 patients according to a clinical report in china 2 involving 1099 confirmed covid-19 patients diabetes was the second most common comorbidity 162 among severe 173 cases there are not enough evidences to determine the risk of diabetes for poor outcomes in covid-19 patients yet a small study showed that covid-19 patients with diabetes were not only at higher risk of severe pneumonia but also release excessive inflammatory biomarkers 3 these results suggest that people with comorbidities especially with dm are susceptible to covid-19 infectionit is well known that acute hyperglycemic crises are significantly related to morbidity or death in peoples with diabetes 4 according to a recent study 5 hospitalization rate and mortality rate per 1000 diabetes cases due to hyperglycemic crises in the past decade have continued to decline in korea unfortunately we have experienced the outbreak of covid-19 limiting the proper use of medical resources in our community lessons we learned from these cases are that chronic disease management could be hampered by unexpected the outbreak and appropriate and aggressive management should be provided in order to improve the prognosis of covid-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertensionthese cases imply that acute hyperglycemic crises can be precipitated by covid-19 and results in catastrophic outcomes in patients with diabetes and poor glycemic control agile policies and strategies for the effective distribution of essential medical resources are necessary to prevent the further loss of life due to the exacerbation of chronic diseasesthe epidemic of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 virus some data describing characteristics and prognosis of patients with covid-19 and diabetes are now available for example for hospitalized patients in the coronado study 1 potential links between diabetes and covid-19 infection were already described 2 indeed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as the receptor for the coronavirus spike protein 3 and ace is expressed on pancreatic beta cells 2 it was suggested that sars-cov2 could induce beta cell damage and new onset diabetes 2 but the phenotype of these new cases of diabetes has not been describedhere we report the case of a 29-year-old woman with a medical history of gastric by-pass one year earlier and family history of diabetes aunts with type 2 diabetes a cousin with type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 7 years she presented two months earlier 20 march 2020 severe asthenia fever stiffness and dyspnea then she presented anosmia and ageusia with anorexia 25 march she was admitted at the emergency department symptomatic treatment was delivered for a suspected covid-19 infection and she was discharged glycemia was normal at this time two weeks after she did no longer have any symptoms but one month after her first symptoms of covid-19 24 april she presented acute polyuriapolydipsia syndrome diabetes mellitus was diagnosed 12 may with a glycemia of 37 gl 205 mmoll non-significant ketosis 07 mmoll and normal bicarbonate level 26 mmoll hba1c level was 118 105 mmolmol her weight was 120 kg before gastric by-pass 65 kg before covid-19 and 57 kg bmi of 215 kgm2 at diabetes diagnosis the diabetes was immediately insulin requiring and she was treated with basal bolus regimen she did not present metabolic comorbidities and markers no hypertension negative crp  06 mgl hdlc 046 gl ldlc 043 gl triglycerides 042 gl normal alt ast ggt and ferritin levels no liver steatosis at the ct scan lipase and tsh levels were normal pancreatic ct scan was normal c-peptide was low at 007 pmolml normal values between 037 and 147 autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells were tested and finally glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 autoantibodies gad-65a were positive 93uiml n  17 in favor of immune-mediated type 1 diabetes whereas tyrosine phosphatase ia2 antibodies ia2a and zinc transporter 8 antibodies znt8a were negativesars-cov2 serology was positive elecsys roche confirming previous covid-19 infectionthis observation highlights the fact that covid-19 infection may also trigger type 1 diabetes onset viral infection in particular by enteroviruses but also by coronaviruses is a well-known environmental trigger for the development of type 1 diabetes 4 in the case presented herein there was a short delay between covid-19 infection and diabetes onset it remains to determine if the hyperinflammationcytokine storm described with this infection could accelerate the onset of type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible individualsin addition the patient was obese before undergoing gastric bypass one year earlier obese patients have higher risks to develop viral infection like influenza with more complications 5 but what about a patient with a massive weight loss in the first year after a bariatric surgeryin conclusion the relationship between sars-cov2 exposition and autoimmune diabetes development must be further studied and incidence of type 1 diabetes will be carefully observed in the next months

achieving glycaemic control is a complex task for people with type 1 diabetes t1d as it involves multiple domains of daily functioning 1 2 to maintain glucose levels that are as much as possible within range patients need to pay attention to meals insulin doses exercise regimens working activities social relations and psychological stress as well as exercise self-control 3 this continuous challenge results in people with t1d occasionally deprioritizing glycaemic control in favour of other activities 4 glucose control may improve during holidays but this improvement is highly variable 57in december 2019 a new coronavirus cov strain that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome emerged in wuhan china ultimately referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and rapidly spread throughout the world 8 in february and march 2020 italy was the second most affected country worldwide 9 to reduce the spread of infection in late february 2020 the italian government issued a series of restrictions that in march 2020 culminated in an almost complete lockdown of the country 10 this lockdown intially involved all sport and educational activities but was then extended to commercial activities and most non-essential services during lockdown all citizens were requested to stay at home 11 outpatient clinics were closed while hospitals were coping with thousands of patients infected with sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2 pandemic not only caused morbidity and mortality among people with cov disease but also imposed a heavy burden on societal and population health 12 it is expected that individuals with chronic disease such as diabetes will suffer the most from the prolonged lockdown due to limitations in access to outpatient clinics and servicesremote glycaemic monitoring through cloud platforms has enabled diabetes specialists to interact with individuals with t1d during the sars-cov-2 pandemic lockdown the widespread use of the flash glucose monitoring system fgm among patients with t1d 13 has allowed healthcare professionals hcps to monitor these patients through a web-based interface that records real-time sensor readings of note telemedicine has been shown to improve psychosocial outcomes in young adults with diabetes 14 according to a recent meta-analysis fgm has the potential to improve overall glucose control 15 and to reduce hypoglycaemia in individuals with t1d 16 17in this study we examined glycaemic control during the first week of lockdown against the spread of sars-cov-2 in people with t1d using fgm in italy in comparison to the pre-lockdown periodpatients with t1d who were eligible for inclusion in the study met the following criteria attended the diabetes outpatient clinic of the university hospital of padova lived in the area were using the freestyle libre fgm system abbott diabetes care rome italy for at least 3 months were sharing sensor data with the diabetes outpatient clinic on a web-based cloud system libreview abbott diabetes care and had  90 coverage of sensor data the libreview platform is intended to assist both people with diabetes and hcps in reviewing analysing and evaluating sensor data to support diabetes management in order to record only spontaneous changes in glycaemic control patients who had already sought therapeutic advice were excluded from enrolment patients had provided online informed consent to be remotely connected to the diabetes clinicdiagnosis of t1d was based on the american diabetes association ada criteria and was confirmed by positive autoantibody testing 18for all patients we retrieved the following data age sex diabetes duration body mass index history of hypertension and smoking habit most recent glycated haemoglobin hba1c

cotransporter-2 inhibitors and drugs for the management of concomitant risk factorsraw data on sensor glucose readings were retrospectively retrieved from all patients at 15-min intervals to avoid an impact of scan frequency on average glucose levels we did not consider glucose readings from sensor scans in our analysis raw data were imported on a dedicated spreadsheet and the following metrics were computed average glucose with standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv expressed as the percentage of average glucose time in hypoglycaemia  70 mgdl time in glucose range 70180 mgdl time in hyperglycaemia  180 mgdl and number of scans per day as per convention we set a cutoff of 150 mgdl to define highlow average glucose and a sd cutoff of 50 mgdl to define stableunstable control the primary endpoint was average glucose these variables were calculated for each of the following periods fig 1a 3 months before the sars-cov-2 outbreak in italy 1 week before the sars-cov-2 outbreak in italy from the closure of sport and educational activities to lockdown of the padova area when commercial activities and non-essential services were closed period 1 and the first week after lockdown period 2patients were divided into groups based on whether they stopped their working activities during lockdown or whether they continued working during lockdown because of being involved in essential services eg workers in the healthcare system or food supply chain patients who continued working served as negative controls for those who stopped working during the lockdown periodcontinuous variables are presented as the mean  sd if normally distributed or as the median and interquartile range iqr if non-normally distributed normality was checked using the shapirowilk test and non-normal variables were log-transformed before being analysed with parametric tests categorical variables were presented as percentages comparisons between two or more groups were performed using the two-tail unpaired students t test for continuous variables or the chi-square test for categorical variables comparison of variables recorded before and after lockdown was performed using the two-tail paired students t test the wilcoxon rank test was used to compare paired categorical data statistical significance was accepted at p  005a total of 33 patients with t1d were enrolled in the study then categorized into one of two groups based on whether they stopped working n  20 or continued working n  13 during the lockdown clinical characteristics of the two groups are reported in table 1 none of the patients were known to be have been infected with sars-cov-2 nor to be have been quarantined for close contact with infected peoplethe 20 patients who stopped working due to the lockdown had an average age of 369 years 60 were male and average diabetes duration was 15 years the mean latest available hba1c value was 76 and the prevalence of complications was low when data collected during the week before the sars-cov-2 outbreak in italy were compared to those of the first week of lockdown period 2 average glucose had decreased from 1777  456 mgdl 99  25 mmoll to 1610  403 mgdl 89  22 mmoll p  0005 fig 1b which is equal to a reduction of 167  245 mgdl 09  14 mmoll the standard deviation of sensor readings decreased from 589  196 mgdl 33  11 mmoll to 532  199 mgdl 30  11 mmoll p  0004 as a result of the simultaneous improvement in average glucose and the standard deviation patients moved from a high-unstable profile towards a low-stable profile fig 1c the number of patients in the low-stable profile area increased from three to eight p  002 however the cv which is a better measure of glycaemic stability according to international consensus and recommendations 20 21 did not change substantially across the periods consideredtime in hypoglycaemia was not significantly changed whereas time in range increased from 544  42 to 652  42 p  0010 and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 423  48 to 316  44 p  0016 fig 1d the number of scans per day did not change significantly from 126  24 to 134  29 p  0479 reduction of average glucose was directly correlated with baseline average glucose r  047 p  0016 but not with the number of scans per daywhen data collected during period 2 were compared to those collected during the 3 months before sars-cov-2 spread the same significant improvements were noted table 2 data collected during period 1 were not significantly different from those collected 1 week or 3 months before sars-cov-2 outbreakpatients who continued working during the lockdown n  13 had an average age of 45 years 538 were male and average diabetes duration was 246 years and thus longer than that of the group not working eight patients were on insulin pump therapy none of the patients who continued to work showed improvement in any of the measures of glucose control during the lockdown period period 2 compared to the 3 months or the week before the sars-cov-2 outbreak average glucose standard deviation cv time in hypoglycaemia time in range and time in hyperglycaemia remained unchanged table 2 as did the number of scans per day no difference was observed regarding any change in glucose control metrics among those who were on the insulin pump and those who were on a regimen of multiple daily insulin injectionsour data show that during the first week of lockdown due to the sars-cov-2 outbreak in north-east italy patients with t1d who stayed at home achieved a significant improvement in glucose control among patients with t1d followed at the same clinic who continued working in the same period many of whom were on insulin pump therapy no deterioration of glucose control was observedthe sars-cov-2 pandemic represents a huge challenge to public health worldwide 22 and healthcare services have faced severe challenges during outbreaks of the coronavirus disease covid-19 resulting in major cut backs in the care provided to people with chronic diseases including diabetes 23 24 many outpatient clinics have had to change their routine interactions with patient and use telemedicine to monitor patients at home 25 in italy the widespread use of fgm among people with t1d allowed these patients to be remotely connected to the clinic through the cloud diabetes professionals were concerned that glucose control could worsen during lockdown because of the limited possibility to exercise and the severe psychologic stress imposed by social distancing in a cultural environment heavily reliant on direct inter-personal relationships during the outbreak most non-essential activities were shut down and most citizens stopped their usual working routine or turned to working at home however some people such as those involved in healthcare or the food supply chain continued to work during the lockdown our observation that glucose control improved during the first week of lockdown in people with t1d who stayed at home is reassuring and suggests that a slowing down of routine activities can have favourable effects on glucose control in the short term remarkably the reduction in average glucose and the increase in time in range were not paralleled by an increased time in hypoglycaemia which remained stable we speculate that such an improvement occurred because patients had more time to concentrate on diabetes control and had a more regular lifestyle including the timing and composition of meals while not being exposed to workplace stress 26 in addition the knowledge that diabetes worsens the outcomes of covid-19 27 28 may have improved patients awareness and compliance to diabetes managementto evaluate whether glucose control changed in all patients with t1d during lockdown irrespectively of whether they stayed at home or not we included a group of patients who continued working the observation that glucose control did not improve in this subgroup of t1d patients supports our interpretation however the groups of patients who stopped working and those who continued their usual working activities were not comparable because the latter had a better baseline glucose control than those who stayed at home and  60 were on insulin pump therapy users of pump therapy represent approximately 30 of patients with t1d at our clinic and 13 of t1d patients nationwide 29 the frequent use of insulin pump therapy among this group of patients is probably related to the fact that most were healthcare workers andor shift workers who often need pump therapy to cope with their lifestyle and working schedules patients who continued working had a higher time in range at baseline such that further improvements were more difficult to obtain yet it is reasonable to assume that these individuals were subjected to stronger challenges during lockdown including exercise limitations social distancing workplace stress and fear of infection therefore that these patients maintained good glycaemic control is reassuring in terms of their effective self-management of diabetes we speculate that the use of fgm combined with insulin pump therapy contributed to this effect 30 for example by limiting diabetes-related distress 31we acknowledge that detailed information to interpret the drivers of glucose control during lockdown such as changes in insulin doses consumption of snacks and exercise were not available and should be investigated in future studies in addition we included patients with t1d having relatively good glycaemic control and showing frequent sensor use therefore it remains unclear whether the same results would apply to patients with worse glucose glycaemic control or less frequent sensor scans finally we did not analyse glycaemic control in the subsequent weeks of lockdown because most patients were remotely contacted by the physicians from the clinic with advice on how to manage diabetes thereby introducing bias hence the medium- and long-term impact of lockdown on glucose control remains unknownin summary we report that glucose control improved in people with t1d who stayed at home during the first week of lockdown due to covid-19 this observation suggests that slowing down routine activities can have beneficial effects on t1d control in the short term however the long-term effects of lockdown and the factors that affect glucose control in this particular situation deserve future investigationcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 virus has become a pandemic within a few months after it was first described in hubei province in china at the time of writing it had affected over 1800000 individuals in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide causing over 110000 deaths 1 the usa and certain regions of europe are currently experiencing the highest disease burden while it is apparently coming under control in china 2covid-19 is highly transmissible from person to person through respiratory secretions the virus enters through mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract later affecting lungs 3 in the majority of cases covid-19 is a mild illness while some people develop severe disease characterised by respiratory compromise dyspnoea respiratory rate  30 breaths per minute blood oxygen saturation  93 pao2fio2  300 andor pulmonary infiltrates on 50 of lung fields on radiological imaging 4 a minority of patients develop critical disease with septic shock or respiratory andor multi-organ failure fewer than 5 of those affected develop serious or critical illness 5 which is likely to be an over-estimate since sub-clinical infection rates in the community are unknown secondary pneumonic bacterial infection can be an additional problemboth type 1 and type 2 diabetes increase the susceptibility to infections and their complications 6 neutrophil dysfunction reduced t cell response and disordered humoral immunity are contributory 7 and bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections are particularly common 8 diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk from pneumonia 9 and hyperglycaemia on admission for pneumonia 11 mmoll predicts poor outcome 9 during the sars epidemic in 20022003 diabetes was an independent predictor of mortality risk or 30 95 ci 14 63 p  0005 10 the presence of comorbidities including diabetes also increased mortality risk independent of age during the middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov epidemic in 2012 adjusted hr 374 95 ci 257 567 11 in another study diabetes had the strongest impact on mortality risk among mers-cov patients 12 similarly among young patients with novel influenza a h1n1 in 2009 diabetes increased the risk of intensive care unit icu admissions adjusted or 472 95 ci 181 123 13according to the available evidence people with diabetes do not have a higher susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection 14 however observations in the recent covid-19 pandemic are comparable to those from other epidemics with higher rates of complications and mortality among patients with diabetes hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease were the main associations with severe disease present in 237 162 58 and 23 respectively of people severely affected by covid-19 15 and mortality rate 538 423 192 and 154 respectively of people who died with the infection 16 immunocompromised state obesity and tobacco smoking are other risk factors for severe disease and death 3 17 18a larger study of 72314 patients with covid-19 in china indicated that patients with diabetes had a threefold higher mortality rate compared with the mortality rate in covid-19 patients overall 73 vs 23 19 in italy where the overall case fatality rate is higher 72 compared with 23 in china among a group of 355 covid-19 fatalities 355 had diabetes and 30 had ischaemic heart disease 20older age the presence of two or more comorbidities and obesity also predict poor prognosis among covid-19 patients 17 21 these are common associations of diabetes and may contribute at least in part to the observed increased risk nevertheless in a nationwide study of 1590 covid-19 patients in china after adjusting for age smoking and comorbidities diabetes was an independent risk factor for the composite outcome of increased icu admission need for ventilation and death hr 159 95 ci 103 245 p  0037 21 so far no published data are available on disease severity among younger patients with type 1 diabetes although experts in the field have observed it to be similar to those without 22similar to previous studies among patients with influenza and bacterial pneumonia elevated serum ferritin lactate dehydrogenase c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr predicted severe disease among patients with covid-19 23 24 this may indicate secondary bacterial infection exacerbating covid-19 increased serum ferritin in particular might suggest a severe secondary bacterial infection among these patients thereby making it useful as a cost-effective prognostic marker 23 24 lymphopaenia was also associated with very severe disease 23 24 raised d-dimer levels were observed in severe illness suggesting a possible consumptive coagulopathy 25 while anticoagulation was linked to decreased mortality rate in covid-19 patients 26among 174 covid-19 patients in wuhan china people with diabetes had a greater inflammatory response higher crp esr and il-6 and relative neutrophilia and lymphopaenia higher incidence of coagulopathy higher d-dimer levels metabolic derangements hyperglycaemia transaminitis severe pneumonia higher radiological scores and higher mortality rate compared with those without 27 however people with diabetes in this study were older and had higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease it is noteworthy that diabetes itself is a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state 28 the data indicate that covid-19 at least in its severe forms is a state of severe inflammation and thrombotic tendency so those with diabetes may be predisposed to such intense immune dysfunction resulting in severe late disease this is further supported by the observation that renal and cardiovascular comorbidities which add to the proinflammatory state further worsen the outcome 27elevated n-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp and cardiac troponin i ctni were significantly correlated with severe disease suggesting that covid-19 may lead to myocardial injury and impair cardiac function 15 in people with diabetes and pre-existing ischaemic heart disease limited cardiac reserve may increase morbidity and mortality riskthe receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2 uses host ace2 for fusion of viral and host cell membranes 29 ace2 is a type 1 integral glycoprotein highly expressed in the kidney endothelium lungs and heart 30 ace2 converts angiotensin i and ii to angiotensin-19 and angiotensin-17 respectively fig 1 the latter acts as a vasodilator and has anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects according to animal studies expression of ace2 in lung tissues is low under normal conditions 31 but is upregulated during lung injury 32 in fact some animal studies 33 and pilot studies in humans 34 have suggested a potential therapeutic role of ace2 against inflammatory acute lung injury furthermore sars-cov the virus responsible for the 20022003 sars epidemic appears to downregulate ace2 expression in infected cells and this is thought to perpetuate the inflammatory injury 35in 2003 patients with sars had higher rates of hyperglycaemia on admission than non-sars pneumonia patients irrespective of their pre-morbid glycaemic status disease severity or glucocorticoid use 10 subsequently sars-cov was shown to bind to ace2 in pancreatic islet cells damage them and cause acute hyperglycaemia possibly contributing to an excessive mortality rate even among people without diabetes 36 a similar mechanism may operate in sars-cov-2 infection contributing to hyperglycaemia excess complications and mortality ratealthough ace2 shares some characteristics with ace1 it is not inhibited by ace inhibitors acei in fact acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs upregulate ace2 expression 37 therefore it has been postulated that aceiarb use might facilitate infection with sars-cov-2 resulting in severe disease 38 39 furthermore ace2 gene polymorphism has been linked to increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and this may also predict susceptibility to severe cov infection 39 by contrast upregulated ace2 may increase levels of angiotensin-17 mounting an anti-inflammatory effect however low angiotensin ii levels due to acei inhibition may mitigate this benefit thus it is still unclear what the balance between benefit and risk might be in continuing or stopping ace inhibition 32following an incubation period of 214 days median 5 days the majority of people with covid-19 will present with cough fever shortness of breath and less commonly nausea and diarrhoea 40 a late phase of sudden deterioration is observed in some patients after about 710 days of fever this is characterised by sudden deterioration in oxygen saturationpeople with diabetes develop similar symptoms however the initial manifestation could be milder fever may be less common 595 vs 832 p  002 and deterioration could occur rapidly in later stages 27 deteriorating glycaemic control and hyperglycaemic emergencies may be a presenting feature and those with type 1 diabetes may present with diabetic ketoacidosis dka 41real-time reverse transcription pcr rrt-pcr remains the gold standard for diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection 42 however its use is limited by cost the need for technology and expertise and limited availability in resource-poor settings igm-based rapid diagnostic tests and other elisa-based serological tests are being developed their key limitation is poorer early sensitivity because it typically takes 5 to 7 days for patients to seroconvert 43 tests for viral antigen detection are also being developedpeople with diabetes need timely integrated interventions to prevent them acquiring the disease enhanced self-management supportive healthcare services and public health measures need to be in place fig 2 if the illness is contracted it should be promptly recognised and supportive measures instituted with specific attention to glycaemic control further advice on this can be found in the easd e-learning portal httpseasd-elearningorgcovid-19the covid-19 pandemic is far from being solely a medical phenomenon it disrupts personal and professional lives severely and affects people and societies on several levels the key strategies promoted for containment of an outbreak such as isolation social distancing and lockdown of cities can have a significant impact on the health and lifestyle of an individual management of a chronic disease such as diabetes which requires dietary modification regular exercise and good adherence to medications poses many complex challengesmaintaining a healthy diet may be challenging because of limited access to appropriate food careful portion selection and adjusting mealtime insulin according to carbohydrate intake continues to be the best strategy particularly for patients on multiple-dose insulin regimensadopting a regular exercise plan might not be feasible owing to social distancing restrictions on outdoor activities and concerns over the high risk of disease spread in gyms and sports centres many of which are closed during lockdown depending on regional restrictions activities such as indoor walking gardening and stationary high intensity activities may be suitable alternatives to maintain an active lifestyleregular monitoring of blood glucose is important continuous glucose monitoring cgm and flash glucose monitoring systems are useful and allow remote monitoring by healthcare providers however see below under management of patients with diabetes and covid-19 for possible concerns regarding the use of paracetamolacetaminophen alongside cgm for patients with type 1 diabetes monitoring of ketone levels particularly for people who are persistently hyperglycaemic and vigilance for the development of symptoms of dka are importantit is also important that people with diabetes have an adequate supply of their medications at home in fact increased incidence of dka among children with type 1 diabetes has been observed due to a delay in seeking medical treatment and in providing routine healthcare for newly developed symptoms as patients are afraid of contracting covid-19 from healthcare settings 22routine clinic visits and overcrowding in hospitals should be minimised to reduce disease spread among people with diabetes measures such as telemedicine consultations or telephone advice issue of medication to caregivers at lower risk online coordination of drug delivery and dispensing medications for extended periods should be considered by healthcare providers non-emergency routine evaluations for foot disease retinopathy etc should be deferred as close contact between the healthcare providers and patients may lead to increased risk of covid-19 transmission patients with limb-threatening or vision-threatening complications should be triaged for immediate attentionduring this time of uncertainty fear helplessness and strong emotions may increase stress in some patients it is important to ensure psychological wellbeing as stress may adversely affect glycaemic control the who recommends minimising reading or listening to news that could cause distress and anxiety regular sleep routines are important relaxation techniques such as meditation can help people with stress and anxiety maintaining contact with relatives friends and neighbours via telephone conversations or using online communication platforms can help to reduce the effects of social isolation 44employers should consider work from home strategies or furlough for employees with poorly controlled diabetes or those with cardiac or renal complications particularly for those in high risk occupations such as frontline healthcare work or similar high risk jobs and especially in areas with high covid-19 prevalencethe majority of people with covid-19 will develop a mild disease that can be managed at home according to local guidelines patients with diabetes developing symptoms suggestive of covid-19 infection should immediately notify local healthcare services to determine the need for diagnostic evaluation assessment of severity isolation and the need for hospitalisation because there is a higher risk of adverse outcomes patients with diabetes should be preferentially managed in hospitals or settings where close monitoring of disease progression is possible for those managed at home regular telephone contact with healthcare services and follow-up is crucial to recognise deterioration in glycaemic control development of hyperglycaemic emergencies or deterioration of clinical statusfrequent glucose monitoring healthy diet adequate hydration and dose titration of glucose-lowering medication in liaison with healthcare providers should be prioritised patients may take symptomatic therapy including paracetamolacetaminophen which is the preferred anti-pyretic agent 45 however paracetamol may interfere with the accuracy of certain cgm sensors 46 in such situations serial capillary blood sugar monitoring can be adopted 47 the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids including ibuprofen for symptom relief has raised several concerns its suppressive effect on immune response is thought to delay recovery while salt and water retention could worsen lung injury 48 nsaids are also thought to upregulate ace2 see previous section ace2 sars-cov-2 and diabetes 39the importance of good glycaemic control during the covid-19 pandemic is emphasised 49 as this is a new viral infection the data are limited and so expert recommendations conform with strategies used in similar epidemics 47 patients with mild covid-19 can be managed with their usual glucose-lowering agents as long as they are able to eat and drink satisfactorily patients should adhere to the sick day rules for people with diabetes 50 and frequent monitoring of capillary glucose is important patients who develop severe illness are likely to need treatment modifications multiple factors including glycaemic status haemodynamic stability nutritional status renal function risk of hypoglycaemia drug interactions and the availability of medications influence the decision making there are specific concerns in relation to glucose-lowering agents when used in patients with covid-19 table 1 metformin may be stopped in patients who are hospitalised and acutely ill owing to the risk of lactic acidosis 51 in severe covid 19 infection the hypoxic state may further increase the risk of lactic acidosisalthough there are no specific data on sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 sglt2 inhibitor use during covid-19 infection it is advisable to withhold these during acute illness because of the increased risk of dehydration and euglycaemic ketoacidosis 52 53 as well as difficulties in maintaining usual perineal hygiene glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist glp-1ra therapy should probably be temporarily discontinued in patients with haemodynamic instability which compromises absorption from subcutaneous sites renal dysfunction and gastrointestinal dysfunction which prevents adequate oral intake treatment with glp-1ras may cause gastrointestinal side effects predisposing to volume depletion and aspiration 54 dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 inhibitors are associated with low risk of hypoglycaemia and are relatively safe across a wide range of renal functions dpp4 inhibitors added to basal insulin improve glycaemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia even among hospitalised patients 55 however these agents are likely to be of less therapeutic benefit in patients with severe covid-19 while patients with mild symptoms could continue dpp4 inhibitors these should be omitted in acute severe illness and replaced with insulin if this becomes necessary during a severe illness fine control of blood glucose is difficult when using sulfonylureas in such patients sulfonylureas should be replaced with insulin caution with sulfonylureas also needs to be exercised if chloroquine is considered because of risk of hypoglycaemia with both thiazolidinediones eg pioglitazone are a less favourable option for in-hospital management of acutely ill patients because of fluid retention and oedema they are contraindicated in patients with haemodynamic instability or hepatic or cardiac dysfunction which may be seen in severe covid-19 infection 56existing evidence favours insulin over other glucose-lowering agents for glycaemic control in hospitalised patients for non-critically ill hospitalised patients subcutaneous insulin therapy with basal or intermediate-acting insulin given once or twice a day along with mealtime boluses of short- or rapid-acting insulin is the preferred strategy for glycaemic management 57 sliding scale therapy should probably not be practiced as this results in greater fluctuations and poor overall control 58 for critically ill patients insulin therapy should be initiated with a glycaemic target of 7810 mmoll 140180 mgdl 59 less stringent glycaemic control with target glucose concentrations 10 mmoll 180 mgdl may be acceptable in terminally ill patients in patients with severe comorbidities and in patient care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible less aggressive insulin regimens aimed at simply minimising glucosuria dehydration and electrolyte disturbances may be justifiable in such patients although there are no strict guidelines regarding the insulin regimen for glycaemic control in critically ill patients intravenous insulin infusions and short or rapid-acting insulin boluses may be used disease severity nutritional status concomitant medications and trend of glycaemic fluctuations should be considered in determining insulin dosage 60in patients with type 1 diabetes with covid-19 and hyperglycaemia it is important to monitor the blood glucose and ketone levels maintain hydration and continue insulin therapystrict infection control measures should be implemented for covid-19 patients with diabetes irrespective of where they are treated considering their vulnerability to acquiring secondary bacterial infections with potential serious consequencesaceiarbs are essential in management of hypertension heart failure and diabetic nephropathy considering the contrasting effects of ace2 on cov infection and inflammatory lung injury see above and fig 1 it is difficult to predict the possible clinical outcomes to date no clear evidence exists for or against the use of aceiarbs in people with diabetes at risk or infected with sars-cov-2 despite the speculations for potential adverse effects 39 there are clear competing risks in stopping since the control of hypertension and the protection against renal disease may be compromised at present most international organisations have recommended continuation of aceiarbs unless there are explicit contraindications such as hypotension or acute kidney injury 32 61there is no clear evidence of risks associated with continuing aspirin although myocardial injury is a well-known serious manifestation of covid-19 acute myocardial ischaemia is not clearly described concerns of atherosclerotic plaque accidents and increased acute ischaemic strokes exist 62 63 until further data are available it would be appropriate to continue aspirin for patients with indication for secondary prevention unless specific individual concerns such as gastrointestinal bleeding are notedat present there is no direct evidence for or against continuation of statins in patients with diabetes and covid-19 there are preliminary reports of raised liver enzymes and muscle enzymes associated with covid-19 although severe liver disease or rhabdomyolysis are not characteristic 64 therefore we suggest an individualised decision considering the indication for statin therapy as well as possible drug interactions with antiviral agentscytokine release syndrome cytokine storm is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of rapid deterioration and multi-organ dysfunction in patients with covid-19 therefore immunomodulatory agents are postulated to be of benefit1 chloroquinehydroxychloroquine these two antimalarial agents have attracted much attention in the treatment of covid-19 on the basis of limited clinical experience as well as due to political reasons chloroquine has shown antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties in previous experimental studies 65 hydroxychloroquine has shown superior potency compared with chloroquine in experimental studies 66 and has a more favourable safety profile probably because it has a lower level of tissue accumulation 67a study from france involving 36 virologically confirmed patients with covid-19 showed that chloroquine at a dose of 600 mg a day for 10 days reduced the virus carriage significantly at 6 days of therapy compared with standard care 68 however this was a non-randomised study recruited less than the estimated sample size was under-powered for assessment of clinical outcomes had differences between intervention and control groups older mean age and higher azithromycin use in intervention group and a higher dropout rate in the intervention arm due to 3 icu admissions 1 death 2 withdrawals of consent emphasising the need for very cautious interpretationa systematic review of literature by cortegiani et al concluded that evidence is limited to experimental in vitro studies showing antiviral potency of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine 69 more than 20 ongoing randomised clinical trials are investigating the utility of these agents

pre-emptive therapy of covid-19 nct04308668there are specific safety concerns for people with diabetes as hypoglycaemia is a known adverse effect of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine treatment suggested mechanisms are decreased intra-cellular insulin degradation increased insulin-mediated glucose transport increased insulin release and enhanced insulin sensitivity 71 therefore extra caution should be exercised when used with other glucose lowering agents and dose reduction may become necessaryprolongation of the qt interval and serious cardiac arrhythmias are known albeit rare dose-dependent adverse effects of chloroquinehydroxychloroquine the risk is greater in those with pre-existing cardiac disorders especially comorbid coronary artery disease and diminished cardiac reserve covid-19 itself is known to induce myocardial injury adding to the risk regular ecg monitoring before and while on therapy is recommended some guidelines recommend against combining with other qt prolonging agents such as azithromycin lopinavirritonavir while others recommend cautious use esm table 12 glucocorticoids although glucocorticoids are used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards data for their use in ards caused by viral pneumonia are minimal and therefore they are not recommended for routine use in covid-19 72 the place of glucocorticoids in the treatment of covid-19 is being investigated nct04273321 if they are used in patients with diabetes hyperglycaemia may worsen necessitating escalation of insulin therapythe fda has authorised emergency use of remdesivir which although not affecting mortality significantly shortens the course of the disease 73 further studies are in progress to evaluate this treatment as well as other antiviral agents esm tables 2 and 3 if proven to be effective among patients without diabetes it is likely that patients with diabetes would also benefit from such therapeutic agents although caution should always be exercised in patients with multi-morbidity1 metformin yu et al showed that metformin reversed lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary oedema vascular leakage and neutrophil accumulation and reduced the levels of tnf- il-1 il-6 and il-17 in an ards model 74 patients with severe sars-cov-2 develop ards which is mediated by dysregulated immune response producing a cytokine storm however hypoxia in severe disease limits its use due to a risk of lactic acidosis further research is needed regarding the role of metformin as a host-directed treatment for severe covid -19 752 incretin based therapies dpp4 is a ubiquitous type ii transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many cells including the alveolar epithelium and inflammatory cells mers-cov uses dpp4 to gain entry into host cells 76 dpp4 inhibition mitigated inflammatory response in experimental studies 77 it is not known if sars-cov-2 uses dpp4 for cell entry to date neither benefit nor harm has been shown in humans on dpp4 inhibitors during cov infections therefore dpp4 inhibitors could be continued at least in mild cases of covid-19 while potential benefit in treating cov infection remains to be studied further 78 similarly glp-1ras are known to have anti-inflammatory effects and have shown potential for therapeutic benefit in acute lung injury 79 however data are limited to experimental models and their benefit at best remains speculativeno agent had been approved so far for pre- or post-exposure chemoprophylaxis evidence from randomised clinical trials is urgently needed chloroquine has demonstrated antiviral activity against five out of seven known human coronaviruses including covid-19 80 and is a leading candidate for prophylactic use 81 ongoing trials in china have yielded encouraging preliminary findings 70 but the data are generally contentious several other trials are in progress the phydra trial nct04318015 and copcov study nct04303507 patients with diabetes are also included

humankind after the second world war identification of effective preventive and treatment strategies is urgently needed people with diabetes and related comorbidities have been shown to fare worse although the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms behind this link are not yet fully understood researchers and authorities worldwide should take urgent steps to answer critical questions in the prevention and management of covid-19 and the protection of people with diabetes text box unanswered questionsit is imperative to establish standard case definitions data collection recording and sharing strategies and operational guidelines to allow comparison and analysis of data standardisation of research protocols and identification of research priorities is essential to utilise time and resources productively the role of pharmaceutical agents in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 in terms of their efficacy safety and cost effectiveness should be evaluated as a priority further data are needed especially looking at the effects of aceiarbs and sglt2 inhibitors in those infected as well as in the severely illhealthcare systems should adopt strategies for case detection and treatment while maintaining care and supply of essential medicines for people with chronic diseases such as diabetes to reduce morbidity and mortality risk due to such diseases during this period the strategic utilisation of human resources in healthcare services and safeguarding their health is a timely need the current challenge for healthcare systems should be an opportunity to improve service provision learn from successful regional and global strategies and prepare for future challenges of greater magnitude the pandemic also highlights the need for joined-up public health measures and care-for-all policiesthe 2019 pandemic coronavirus covid-19 has affected more than three million people in 211 countries causing more than two hundred thousand deaths as of the end of april 20201 the etiologic agent of this disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 which is transmitted through contact with infected persons or contaminated fluids23several risk factors are associated with this disease in a multicenter cohort study advanced age was found to be significantly correlated with overall covid-19 prevalence which is consistent with the higher incidence observed in older adults4 the sex is another risk factor as a higher prevalence has been seen in men than women4 other studies have shown that the presence of any comorbidity increases the chances of covid-19 infection causing respiratory failure and death in patients5 another study reports that patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu had a higher number of comorbidities 722 than those not admitted to the icu 3736 hence comorbidities are considered a risk factor for fatality and data from other reports show up to a 90 prevalence of comorbidities in fatal cases7 with cardiovascular diseases diabetes hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being the most prevalent known comorbidities in covid-19 cases8currently several published studies describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients and mortality cases affected by covid-19 in different parts of the world for this reason the aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the prevalence and geographical distribution of comorbidities in all patients in those admitted to the icu and in mortality cases affected by covid-19 using the previously published datawhat is the prevalence of comorbidities in all patients patients admitted to the icu and in fatal cases affected by the new coronavirus covid-19this review considered studies that conducted epidemiological and clinical descriptions in patients and in fatal cases from different parts of the world in order to determine the prevalence and geographic distribution of comorbidities in patients affected by covid-19an initial search limited to medline was performed using mesh index terms and related keywords this search was followed by an analysis of the words in the text of the title abstract and index terms used to describe the articles a second search using all the identified keywords and index terms was conducted on may 15 2020 using the following databases latin american and caribbean health sciences literature lilacs the bibliographic database of the us national of medicine medline the elsevier database embase web of science and scopus the mesh index term search included covid-19 sars-cov2 prevalence and comorbidity as covid-19 is a recent topic thesis and dissertation papers have not yet been published and were not evaluatedthe articles selected for data recovery were analyzed by two independent reviewers who assessed the methodological validity of each text before their inclusion in this review the quality of the publications included were evaluated based on the criteria derived from the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation method grade points were awarded to the studies if they did not present limitations in study design or execution risk of bias inconsistency of results evidence based on indirect data imprecision and publication bias a score of four to five points was considered as high quality three points as moderate quality and zero to two points as low qualitythe data were added to the review manager revman 53 for analysis a data extraction table was created to assess the quality of demographic data study location sample size number of cases number of positives and the diagnostic testthe random-effect model meta-analysis method was used to analyze the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in patients and in fatal cases affected by covid-19 in different parts of the world the heterogeneity among the studies was analyzed using the higgins test i2 that shows the percentage of variation among studies these analyses were compiled by using the stata software version 12 statacorp llc texas usa the odds ratio test with a 95 confidence interval 95 ci was calculated to measure the likelihood of death for a patient with a comorbidity compared to a patient without comorbiditiesin the 39 studies used to calculate the pooled prevalence of comorbidities 89238 patients affected by covid-19 were analyzed 11341 127 presented one or more comorbidities 2172 24 were admitted to the icu and 3532 4  patients died the patients age range was 41 to 70 years among these studies only one was conducted in the usa43 and included a large number

disease is shown in table 2the probability of a patient with comorbidity of dying from covid-19 and the significance of this associations using the fishers exact test were calculated the number of patients with comorbidities who died and those who survived in addition to the patients without comorbidities who died and who survived were used to calculate an odds ratio of 24 with 95 ci 17-33 and in the fishers exact test the value of p  00001this meta-analysis was based on 42 studies including a large number of descriptions from china and the united states studies conducted in india italy the united kingdom south korea and singapore were also analyzed a higher prevalence of male patients infected with covid-19 was observed compared to females this predisposition of the male sex was also observed in the diseases mers-cov and sars-co which are also caused by viruses of the coronavirus family4950the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in the general population of patients affected by the new coronavirus covid-19 was 42 95 ci 2659 china was the country with the highest prevalence although there were also more studies analyzed from this country however it is important to highlight that two studies from the united states resulted in contrasting prevalence values 4 and 94 since the united states is the country that leads the statistics so far with the highest number of confirmed cases more than one million and deaths from coronavirus more than seventy thousand on may 8 2020 it is of utmost importance to publish more data on the clinical characteristics of the disease in this countrythe results of this study confirm that the prevalence of comorbidities increases as the patients clinical conditions worsens in the general population affected by covid-19 the prevalence of comorbidities was 42 61 among patients admitted to the icu and 77 among fatal cases males were the most affected in the three groups on the other hand the mean age also increases when we compare the group of patients in general with the group of fatal cases as previously described among risk factors such as age sex and comorbidities4-7regarding comorbidities in the three groups analyzed general population admission to icu and fatal cases hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity accounting for 32 26 and 35 respectively in the general population diabetes was the second-most prevalent 22 comorbidity followed by heart disease 13 and copd 8 however in patients admitted to the icu diabetes 17 and heart disease 18 showed similar values the same phenomenon was observed in fatal cases with diabetes 19 and heart disease 17 showing similar values considering that type 1 diabetes mellitus usually manifests during childhood or adolescence type 2 diabetes frequently manifests in adults and heart diseases are more prevalent in older patients one may think that the earlier onset of diabetes may account for it to rank second among the comorbidities in the general population affected by covid-19 on the other hand the group of fatal cases is composed of predominantly older adults a population in which hypertension diabetes and heart disease are prevalentthe odds ratio for any comorbidity was 24 with 95 ci 17-33 with a statistical significance of p  00001 in other words a patient with a comorbidity has 24 times the chance of dying from covid-19 compared to a patient without a comorbidity this may explain the high prevalence of comorbidities among fatal casesin developing this study we encountered several limitations firstly not all studies segregated epidemiological and clinical data age sex percentage of comorbidity and patients hospitalized in the icu secondly some studies classified comorbidities in the other category but only one study described which diseases were comprised in this category thirdly since china is the primary focus of the rise of the pandemic most of the studies included were from this country no studies from africa oceania or latin america were found finally in meta-analyses it is recommended that publication bias are always assessed by statistical methods however currently available methods such as the funnel plot and the egger regression test are not considered useful tools in studies on proportions51one can conclude that the existence of comorbidities increases the probability of dying from covid-19 by 24 times compared to those who do not have pre-existing conditions the most relevant comorbidities were shown to be hypertension heart disease and diabetes thus comorbidities are more prevalent in the group of mortality cases when compared to the general population group however these conclusions are based on the evidence obtained mostly from studies conducted in china for this reason studies describing the epidemiological and clinical profiles of covid-19 cases in africa oceania and latin america are recommended to clarify the behavior of this disease in these regions and thus be able to apply effective measures aimed at safeguarding populations at riskthe coronaviridae family has several members which continuously circulate among humans and lead to mild respiratory diseases 1 in contrast severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov cause severe respiratory diseases sars-cov was first reported in guang-dong china in 20022003 mers-cov was reported in saudi arabia in june 2012 in december 2019 a novel sars-cov emerged in wuhan china from patients with pneumonia which was identified as a sars pathogen this virus was denoted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 while the disease is denoted covid-19 the typical symptoms of covid-19 at illness onset are fever dry cough myalgia and dyspnea 2 some patients might suffer from headaches dizziness diarrhea nausea and vomiting however people with underlying diseases such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease may develop severe neurological disorders including acute cerebrovascular disease 3 4 5 based on these clinical data the who advised caution against covid-19 infection among smokers and patients with underlying clinical symptoms including cardiovascular disease 6 see table 1
zhou et al reported that sars-cov-2 shares the same receptor ace2 with sars-cov 7 however it does not use another coronavirus receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 whereas mers-cov does 8 increasing evidence supports the idea that the s-protein of sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 these studies suggest that the cellular entry of sars-cov-2 is mediated through ace2 since sars-cov-2 infection causes severe lung injury the sars-cov-2 virus may use ace2 expressed by pneumocytes in the epithelial alveolar lining to infect subjects however increasing clinical studies have shown that sars-cov-2 is not only observed in organs with endothelial dysfunction 9 but also in the postmortem brain 10 since cells that express ace2 are potentially at risk for sars-cov-2 infection ace2 expression profiling under various conditions in the brain can help understand the process of covid-19 and cardiovascular complications including neurological diseasesamong patients with covid-19 new-onset cvd increases in individuals who have risk factors including smoking and diabetes the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that covid-19 patients with diabetes had higher mortality 11 in south korea the kcdc reported that as of april 30 247 deaths occurred of which 244 are deaths with underlying disease among them the mortality rate of covid-19 patients with the underlying disease with a metabolic disease or cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes stroke and hypertension 12 clinical data characterizing patients with covid-19 give evidence that cvd risk factors including smoking and diabetes are likely associated with negative progression and adverse outcomes of covid-19 13 recently a high level of ace2 has been observed in the brains of smokers 14 hence we consider that smoking and diabetes might increase the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter and infect the brain based on the high expression of ace2in the present study we investigated the alteration of ace2 expression in the brains of ischemic stroke as well as the effect of cvd risk factors including cse and diabetes on ace2 expression we showed that ace2 expression was altered in the cortex penumbra of ischemic injuries in addition ace2 expression was highly increased in brain microvessels exposed to cse and in endothelial cells derived from patients with diabetesthe anti-ace2 antibody nbp2-90854 was purchased from novus littleton co usa heparin dimethyl sulfoxide dmso bicinchoninic acid and all chemicals were purchased from sigma st louis mo usac57blksj dbdb male mice were used as type 2 diabetes mellitus model mice while c57blksj male m

c the increase in ace2 protein levels began 7 days after the ischemic injury and the maximum increase was observed at 21 daysour previous study found that cse induces brain inflammation 15 in the brain ace2 is mainly expressed in microvessels and astrocytes 16 since a recent study showed high expression of ace2 in smoker groups we investigated the effect of cse on the expression of ace2 in human brain microvessels and astrocytes cells were treated with cse for the indicated times 0 3 and 6 h as shown in fig 3
a ace2 protein expression was significantly increased by cse in hbmvec this increase was also observed in astrocytes treated with cse fig 3b furthermore cse elevated the level of icam1 a risk factor for blood-brain barrier bbb disruption in hbmvecblood vessel damage has been found in patients with type i and ii diabetes 17 here we wondered whether ace2 expression is altered in blood vessels of patients with diabetes we compared the ace2 levels between the endothelial cells of healthy humans and subjects with type i and ii diabetes as shown in fig 4
 we found that ace2 protein levels were slightly but significantly increased in both endothelial cells of patients with type i or ii diabetes compared with those of healthy controls using type ii diabetes dbdb mice we confirmed that ace2 expression was increased in the brains of mice with type ii diabetesour data demonstrate that ace2 a functional receptor of sars-cov-2 was upregulated in the brain of cvd and its risk factors were diabetes and cigarette smoke although detailed clinical studies using large populations are needed before making a conclusive claim diabetes patients stroke patients and smokers should be identified as groups that are susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection in order to provide them adequate protection and careace2 is expressed in all tissues including the lungs arteries heart kidneys intestines and brain it regulates blood pressure through the hydrolysis of angiotensin ii vasoconstrictor into angiotentin1-7 vasodilator excessive angiotensin ii activates diverse cellular signaling pathways related to inflammation free radical generation and recruitment of inflammatory cells thus the deficiency of ace2 causes an increase in angiotensin and leads to organ injury through aberrant production of reactive oxidative stress and inflammation 18 ace2 deficiency has been associated with exacerbation of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy induced by angiotensin ii 19 several studies have shown that the loss of ace2 is involved in the progression of strokes alzheimers disease ad 16 and hypertension 20 conversely the overexpression of ace2 blocks the pro-inflammatory responsiveness related to the pathogenesis of ad therefore the deficiency of ace2 in the progression of the disease may cause unregulated cytokine productionthe who suggests that smoking and diabetes are high-risk factors for covid-19 infection which led us to investigate ace2 expression patterns in cvd in these high-risk groups our present data showed that ace2 mrna and protein levels gradually increased during reoxygenation after a stroke and the protein levels were significantly increased 21 days after ischemic injury compared to the sham control fig 2 in the study supporting our data the ace2angiotensin1-7mas receptor signaling axis is activated after an ischemic stroke in which ace2 expression is increased 21 which may play a therapeutic role in vasodilatation and anti-inflammatory responses 22 administration of ang 17 derived from ace2 reduced improve neurological deficits following ischemic stroke through reducing oxidative stress and inflammation 2324 thus in our present data increased ace2 at the subacute and chronic stages after an ischemic injury is likely to have beneficial effects beyond repairing injured cells and lowering blood pressure in other words it indicates that ace2 levels may be elevated in the brains of stroke patients and in individuals who have previously experienced a stroke however this induced ace2 expression that follows ischemic injuries may lead to covid-19 susceptibility in an in vivo study the regulation of ace2 expression by sars-cov-mediated internalization was predicted to worsen lung failure 25 hence stroke patients might need to take extra caution during the covid-19 pandemiccovid-19 causes new-onset cvd in individuals with risk factors such as smoking and diabetes however to date there is not enough evidence to know how covid-19 evokes cvd including strokes recent reports suggest a possibility that covid-19 triggers inflammation involved in the pathological progression of cvd such as clot formation in the blood 26 blood clotting is formed by cellular components such as histones 27 hmgb1 28 microparticles 2 and secreted granule proteins 29 which can be degraded by pro-fibrinolytic agents released from the endothelial cells 30 thus in the surface of endothelial dysfunctions cellular and protein materials congregate and produce a blood clot as a consequence 30 in particular regarding the disease an increase of blood clots and bbb disruption have been observed in patients with type ii diabetes 31 our present data showed an increase in vascular ace2 levels in t1d and t2d patients compared to healthy controls fig 4 these results support the possibility that cellular entry of sars-cov-2 through ace2 onto vessels makes the vessels weaker than they were before the onset of diabetes and may disrupt the blood supply to the brain via clot blocking however the exact mechanism underlying covid-19-induced cvd is requiredlike diabetes smoking is known as a risk factor for cvd as well as lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd the deleterious effects of cse on the bbb are known to upregulate inflammation-related genes including icam1 and vcam1 in blood vessels the increase of icam1 and vcam1 in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines plays a crucial role in the adhesion of leukocytes including neutrophils and macrophages resulting in bbb disruption and brain inflammation however ace2 expression with cigarette smoking is controversial a recent clinical study showed that ace2 expression is increased in the airways of smokers which correlates with the expression of the 7 subtype of nicotine acetylcholine receptors 26 in contrast nicotine a component of cigarette smoking reduced ace2 expression in primary neurons and glial cells of cvd 32 nonetheless in this study we clearly showed upregulation of ace2 following cse in brain endothelial cells and astrocytes fig 3 under the same conditions cse increased icam1 protein levels in primary human brain vessels fig 3 furthermore our previous study provided evidence that cse induces brain inflammation via astrocyte reactivation 15 taken together these results suggest that a weaker vascular system among covid-19 patients with a history of smoking makes them more vulnerable to severe symptomsin this study we demonstrated that ace2 expression was increased in the brain after a stroke in the mouse brain or human blood vessels with diabetes ace2 expression was upregulated we showed the in vitro effect of cse on ace2 expression in blood vessels finally although the in vivo relevance of our data needs to be verified using a human population caution may be warranted against covid-19 among individuals with underlying diseases such as strokes diabetes and smokingthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papera lockdown implemented for the covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 12 may have slowed the progression of the disease but has caused restriction of movement resulting in decreased exercise and also dietary indiscretion in patients with type 2 diabetes 34 we have previously reported the impact of this lockdown on worsening of glycated hemoglobin hba1c and the associated complications in type 2 diabetes mellitust2dm 5 probably due to the restriction of movement limited exercise improper diet and psychological stress 6 lack of exercise and improper diet caused by poor availability of healthy food may lead to significant weight gain it is important to note that patients with covid 19 and obesity are associated with worse in-hospital outcomes both mortality rates and the requirement for mechanical ventilation are increased in the presence of obesity in patients diagnosed with covid-19 78while we have generated data on patients with type 2 diabetes there is a paucity of data in an apparently non-diabetic population there are indications of unhealthy weight gain especially in children because of imposed restrictions akin to weight gain seen during summer recess 9it is important to gather such data in non-diabetic adults to assess their risk of developing t2dm and other co-morbidities associated with it this is especially important for asian indians where the rate of conversion to t2dm from the prediabetes state is higher than whites 10 such increment in the number of patients with diabetes in india would be catastrophic because of further addition to a large pool of patientsthis analysis was therefore undertaken to estimate the risk of diabetes due to lockdownbaseline demographic and clinical examination parameters were collected online from 100 household members of t2d patients registered in tertiary care diabetes centre between 42 and 49 days during lockdown telephonic interviews were conducted by a trained diabetes educator on a pre-designed questionnaire from people in a household of a known patient with t2dm under our follow up the total interview time was 35 min no individual refused this interview when approached importantly none of the individuals had any documented history of t2ddata prior to lockdown and 49 days post-lockdown were collected in a file in comma separated values csv format a two-prong analytical strategy was undertaken the first phase involved performing a simple demographic analysis looking into individual risk parameters the second phase involved analyzing the impact of lockdown on weight as well as on the risk of developing t2d the risk of developing diabetes was based on the validated american diabetes association risk scoretable 1
 the components of the risk score were age sex history of gestational diabetes or any first degree relative with diabetes self-reported hypertension self-reported physical activity and bmi each of these variables was identified using a value score a combined score 5 is considered a significant risk for t2d and should undergo screening for the same analysis was performed using the xl-stat statistical software windows 10 64 bits usathere was a 01kg-50 kg increase in weight in 40 of individuals fig 1
 in 16 of the recruited population weight gain was in the range of 2150 kg weight remained unchanged in 41 of the population and there was a varying degree of weight loss in 19 of individuals fig 1 the risk score for diabetes was calculated using bmi in 7 of the population the diabetes risk score increased from baseline while in 90 it remained unchanged fig 2
 in 3 of the population the risk score decreased the chance of crossing the total score of 5 and hence a higher risk of developing t2d was 666 table 2
the individuals recruited for this analysis were predominantly young 59 were below 40 years of age and of the female gender 58 fig 2 males were at a higher risk for t2dm than females individuals below the age of 40 years had no risk but age above 40 years was associated with an increased risk of t2dm per decade individuals who were at or above 60 years of age comprising 9 of the population were at the highest risk designated with a risk score of 3 a history of t2d in first-degree relatives was present in 61 of the population also considered at risk score of 1 in comparison to those who did not fig 2 only 38 of the individuals exercised for at least 3 days a week with 62 in this group at risk of developing t2d score of 1 60 of this group was obese at baseline during 49 days of lockdown 40 of the cohort gained weight with 16 gaining between 20 and 50 kg in weight at baseline 18 of individuals had a bmi greater than 30 kgm2 after 49 days of lockdown 21 of individuals had a bmi greater than 30 kgm2 indicating a 3 increase fig 2in this study we show an increased risk for the development of t2dm in apparently non-diabetic individuals predominantly ascribed to weight gain during the covid19 pandemic weight gain hold paramount importance in any individual but more so in the current era first it increases the risk of t2dm hypertension and dyslipidemia furthermore it increases the mortality risk from covid19 previously there has been no research focusing on the enhanced risk of diabetes during lockdown this is particularly important for india because asian indians have a heightened propensity to develop t2dm 12we have adequate data implicating weight gain as a significant factor for the development of metabolic disorders weight gain in the background of obesity results in the expansion of visceral fat resulting in activation of inflammatory response in adipocytes 13 there is also an inverse relationship between body mass index and brown adipose tissue bat an increase in bmi from baseline results in a decrease in bat and a consequent increase in white adipose tissues wat responsible for worsening of insulin resistance and its associated metabolic complications in another study our group showed a marked decrease in physical activity and increased intake of carbohydrates and snacking all reasons that could add to weight gain and destabilize metabolism 14 further ford et al 15 documented that a 5 kg weight gain from baseline could result in a 27 increased risk of developing t2d in addition gaining weight on the background of preexisting obesity could increase the risk of t2dm by a further 262 indicating that the risk of t2d increases continuously per every kilogram of weight gained 15 the adverse impact of weight gain in this study was documented in 8545 us adults followed up for a period of 10 years in addition there is robust evidence illustrating weight loss as an effective means of preventing t2dm from a pre-diabetic stage collectively this information accentuates the need to aggressively pursue weight control to prevent t2d 16as stated previously our analysis was the first in india and globally to document the impact of externally imposed restrictive lifestyle on weight and the effects of weight gain on the risk of developing t2d our findings indicate an immediate need to address this important aspect of diabetes risk as an additional 666 increase in high-risk diabetes score could add substantially to patients with t2dm and increase the burden of complications spelling disastrous consequences to the health and beleaguered economy of nation 17 in addition we can also expect an increase in other weight gain-related morbidities hypertension dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease further exacerbating the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in india for the present cohort since these individuals were relatives of t2d patients registered in the recruiting clinic based on their risk profile blood glucose monitoring and assessment for t2d can be done in a phase-wise manner laterin the absence of any evidence on the hypothesis being investigated and the difficulty in collecting data in the current scenario this is the first and the best available data in addition the baseline age and gender distribution in this cohort matches the demographics of our country and thereby some degree of generalization of the findings could be permitted finally and most importantly since the indian diabetes risk score required measurement of waist circumference which was not possible to conduct due to technical difficulties the bmi cutoff was measured this was higher than the indian criteria suggesting that our estimates are underestimated rather than overestimation of the scenario this should be acceptable as a limitation because the risk of overestimation is a major challenge when analyzing smaller populationsthis was a single centre study and conducted in a tertiary centre hence its reproducibility should not be automatically assumed without larger multi-centric studies moreover diabetes risk assessment identifies those at-risk not necessarily those with diabetes and hence it should not be assumed that there was an increment in t2d prevalence to provide conclusive evidence on this risk assessment should be followed by blood glucose measurement this was not done in our study in addition only a very small number of patients were studied and this could have skewed the data finally an indian diabetes risk score would have been more appropriate instead of the ada criteria due to the difference in criteria for defining obesity based on bmiweight gain is a very important determinant as far as the development or worsening of metabolic disorders are concerned the lockdown implemented after the sars-cov-2 pandemic may negatively impact weight and predispose individuals to risk of metabolic decompensation this analysis was the first to document weight gain over a period of 49 days post lockdown along with a tendency towards increased risk of developing type 2 diabetesnonenone to declarethe novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has been on the rampage ever since its outbreak in december 2019 in wuhan china to date the disease has affected over 53 million people inflicting more than 342000 casualties in over 200 nations worldwide 1 although the overall mortality rate of covid-19 ranges from 14 to 72 23 patients with underlying co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus dm tend to have severe disease acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and increased mortality 45 people with both type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm and type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm are at a high risk of poor outcomes with covid-19 6 thus people with dm need to be overly cautious amid the ongoing pandemic and must stringently follow social distancing ensure proper hand hygiene and maintain good glycemic control to avoid contracting the disease 578 however peoples adherence to these control measures will be largely affected by their awareness about the disease and the means of preventing them proper awareness is likely to translate into effective preventive practices however in a cross-sectional survey conducted among 630 adults with one or more underlying chronic conditions nearly one-third of participants could not correctly identify the symptoms of covid-19 or the ways to prevent infection 9nationwide lockdowns imposed by governments all over the world have made things more difficult for people with dm a recent study from china had shown that elderly subjects with t2dm experienced worsening of glycemic control during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic manifesting as higher fasting blood glucose limitation of physical activity altered diet restricted availability of anti-diabetic medications stress due to lockdown and lack of in-clinic follow-ups could have been the contributing factors 10 dietary adherence and physical activity are the cornerstones for the management of t1dm as well 1112 besides stress and frequency of clinic visits are important predictors of glucose control in people with t1dm 1314 thus the aforementioned factors that could have resulted in suboptimal glucose control in elderly individuals with t2dm might also play a role in contributing to the worsening of glycemic profile in people with t1dm amid the lockdownthe present study was conducted with the intent to assess the awareness amongst young adults with t1dm regarding covid-19 and the problems being faced amid the ongoing lockdown in india through telephone-based narrative interviewstwo members of the research team uy and av with fluency in english hindi and punjabi conducted all the interviews both uy and av were trained before interviewing and received regular feedback from rp and skb on the interview conduct during data collection based on recordings on average 3 interviews were conducted per day with each interview lasting for 1520 min the interviews were narrative and the participants were asked 8 open-ended questions five pertaining to their awareness about covid-19 that included knowledge about covid-19 modes of transmission symptoms additional risks associated with covid-19 in a patient with diabetes and means of protection against covid-19 rest 3 questions catered to problems the patients had been facing concerning dietary adherence physical activity and ongoing treatment as a result of the prevailing lockdown the participants were allowed to answer each question freely without any interruption from the interviewer only when the participant had completed answering one question with hisher due permission the interviewer would move onto the next question the first two interviews served as pilot interviews that reconfirmed the order in which the questions would be presented to the interviewee all the interviews were recorded and initially transcribed by the interviewers uy and av in the native language of the interview the verbatim transcripts were then translated into english prior to content analysis throughout the process of data collection we conducted interim analyses to gain an understanding of potential saturation of responses and thus the conclusion of data collectionthe transcripts were analyzed manually using qualitative content analysis 2829 each transcript was read several times and relevant parts were extracted we employed each primary question as an overarching category deductive coding these broad categories were further broken down into subcategories based on the findings that emerged from analyses of the transcripts inductive coding answers to a question bearing the same meaning and content were assembled and ascribed a common code initially uy analyzed all the transcripts to generate an initial series of codes for each of the 8 primary questions next rp and skb independently coded all the interviews and reviewed all the transcripts as well as all the codes assigned by uy the analyses were discussed during consensus meetings uy rp and skb and any differences in interpretation were discussed and resolved thereafter a second round of analyses was independently undertaken by uy rp and skb wherein all the ascribed codes were again reviewed followed by a final discussion among the team membersall the participants said that coronavirus diseasecovid-19 is a viral disease some of them further classified it as a pandemic a respiratory disease a highly contagious disease or a fatal disease one participant described the disease as having originated in wuhan with the initial source of infection being bats while another participant narrated the disease as being caused by a laboratory-made virusthe majority of the participants 83 said that the coronavirus spreads via inhalation of respiratory droplets forty percent of the participants described fomites as the mode of transmission however only 10 participants 30 could recount both respiratory droplets and fomites as potential modes of transmissionthe most commonly encountered response was fever 80 followed by cough cold difficulty in breathing and tiredness the cough was further characterized as dry by 6 participants 20 only 12 participants 40 did mention all the three cardinal symptoms namely fever cough and difficulty in breathing one participant did mention loss of smell and taste as a symptom as well two participants 7 were not aware of the symptoms at allseven participants 23 were not aware of any additional risks associated with covid-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus twenty participants 67 had opined that patients with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of infection with coronavirus twelve of them believed that the weak immune system in persons with diabetes mellitus was the underlying reason only 3 participants had the correct knowledge they had stated that patients with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of complications respiratory problems and fatal outcomes if they get infected with the coronavirusparticipants believed that staying indoors maintaining social distancing wearing facemasks while going outside regular hand washing with soap and water and regular use of hand sanitizers were the necessary precautions required to protect themselves from coronavirus infection in total 16 participants 53 mentioned all the 3 major modes of protection namely staying indoors maintaining social distance and regular hand wash with soap and water the importance of not touching ones face was pointed out by only one participant only one participant felt the need to have a good glucose control to ward off the infectionninety percent of the participants recounted that their diet has remained unaltered amid the prevailing circumstances one of who believed that her diet had improved as she was getting home-cooked food all the time only 3 participants believed that the ongoing lockdown had brought about some changes to their routine diet one of them had co-existing celiac disease and was not able to procure gluten-free oats another participant was worried about not being able to get his usual fruits namely papaya guava and golden apple all having low glycemic indices however he did feel the need to have fruits to boost his immune system and hence had to replace them with those that were more readily available like watermelon and ripe bananas both having high glycemic indicesbefore lockdown all the 30 participants had been performing some form of physical activity ranging from yoga to walk to outdoor games to resistance exercises in gym when interviewed most of the participants 90 said that their routine physical activityexercise had been reduced amid the lockdown amongst them a few participants 57 had resorted to some form of physical activity like walking in the terrace or garden or front of the house while wearing masks however all believed that the duration and intensity of physical activity had been reduced ten participants 33 admitted that they were not performing any form of physical activity at all ever since the commencement of lockdown only 3 female participants 10 were confident that they were able to perform the same extent of physical activity as they had been performing prior to lockdown one of them had been regularly carrying out yoga at home the second woman used to skip ropes in the morning and had recently started performing yoga guided by youtube videos the third woman used to perform aerobic dance workout at home for 30 min every dayamid the lockdown 5 participants 17 were finding it difficult to procure the prescribed insulin preparation one of them had voluntarily reduced the dose of insulin due to the non-availability of the same in the nearby pharmacies most of the participants had stocked up insulin vialscartridges at home just prior to the commencement of lockdown before lockdown all but one participant used to perform self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose smbg at home during the ongoing lockdown 10 participants 34 had reduced the frequency of smbg six of them due to limited availability of glucose strips from the pharmacies two of them due to financial constraints while rest two believed that frequent smbg would make them all the more anxious amid the prevailing circumstances seventy-two percent of the participants stated their current self-monitored blood glucose recordings were higher than those prior to lockdown in addition 5 participants had one or more documented episodes of hypoglycemia one participant had an episode of severe hypoglycemia requiring hospital admission 3 days before the date of the interview besides 80 of the participants were concerned that they were unable to visit their physicians for routine follow-ups only one participant was in touch with diabetes educators of the aditi group via social platformsto the best of our knowledge this is the first study examining the awareness and problems faced by people with t1dm amid the ongoing covid-19 pandemic in this qualitative interview study comprising of 30 young adults with t1dm we found that there were lacunae in their knowledge and awareness about covid-19 most of the participants were able to continue with their routine diet and prescribed treatment however 72 of the individuals complained of higher blood glucose based on self-monitored capillary blood glucose recordings this was likely because of reduced physical activity reported by the majority of the participants 90although people with diabetes mellitus dm are not at a higher risk of infection with covid-19 compared to a non-diabetic population the presence of underlying dm portends a poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 in terms of severe disease ards and increased mortality 4 5 6 in a study comprising of 1590 covid-19 patients from china dm was found to be an independent predictor of admission to icu or invasive ventilation or death hazard ratio 159 95 ci 103245 30 hence people with dm must realize this fact and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves this would however be possible only if they are aware of the disease the possible modes of transmission and measures to protect themselves besides people with dm should ensure good glycemic control as it would strengthen the host innate immune response 57 however amid the nationwide lockdowns imposed by governments all over the world glycemic control is expected to take a backseat possible explanations include alteration in routine diet limitation of physical activity restricted availability of anti-diabetic medications lack of follow-ups and constant stress and anxiety amid the ongoing pandemic and the prevailing lockdown 8 the situation is expected to be worse in people with t1dm as they are on obligatory insulin therapy and any interruption in treatment or routine schedule can lead to life-threatening complications in the form of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemiawhen awareness of participants regarding covid-19 was assessed we found some major lacunae only 30 of the participants mentioned both respiratory droplets and fomites as possible modes of transmission similarly while fever was stated as a common symptom of covid-19 by 80 of the participants only 12 40 participants could recount all the three cardinal symptoms namely fever cough and difficulty in breathing besides two participants were not aware of the symptoms at all in addition only 16 53 participants were aware of all the three principal means of protection from covid-19 namely staying indoors maintaining social distance and regular hand wash with soap and water it is very likely that only these 16 participants must be properly abiding by all the necessary precautions lastly 23 of the participants were unaware of any additional risks associated with covid-19 in people with diabetes mellitus thereby implying that they will not feel the need to take extra precautions as is expected from people with dm on the contrary 67 of the participants had the misconception that people with dm are at a higher risk of infection this is still acceptable as they are expected to take more precautions to protect themselves from covid-19a recently conducted cross-sectional survey in the united states of america amongst 630 adults aged 2388 years living with 1 or more chronic conditions found that nearly one-third of the participants were not able to identify the symptoms correctly or describe the ways to prevent them 9 an online cross-sectional survey examining knowledge attitude and practices towards covid-19 among chinese residents using closed-ended questions found that the overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90 however the participants belonged to a relatively high socioeconomic status and were well-educated and that the results could not be generalized to the entire chinese population 31 socio-economic status is an important determinant of knowledge and awareness with regard to communicable and non-communicable diseases 32 higher socio-economic status has also been shown to correlate with improved awareness and disease preventive behavior against covid-19 933 similarly educational status is a well-known factor affecting disease awareness with higher educational status correlating with better disease knowledge and vice-versa 3133 34 35 the participants in our study were relatively well educated 87 being educated up to 12th standard or higher still we witnessed major lacunae in awareness about covid-19 because the overall literacy rate in india is 74 36 it is expected that the scenario is likely to be worse in the illiterate or less educated sections of the society the deficit has to be immediately addressed the easiest and most effective means would be to improve awareness about covid-19 using all types of broadcast print and social media in addition non-governmental organizations should take up the responsibility to improve cognizance among high-risk groups like people with t1dm using various social platforms like whatsapp facebook instagram etc as a matter of fact soon after the results of the index study were available aditi had started an awareness program via whatsapp amongst all its members we believe that this endeavor will improve the knowledge and awareness of people with t1dmwhen enquired about the problems being faced by the participants amid the lockdown the most common response was a reduction in physical activity as reported by 90 of the individuals in addition 72 of the participants complained of high glucose recordings since the commencement of lockdown the majority of the participants had no difficulty in procuring insulin or maintaining a healthy diet thus the apparent worsening of blood glucose as reported by the participants could have resulted from a reduction in physical activity moreover 5 participants had one or more episodes of hypoglycemia and 80 were concerned about the inability to physically follow-up with the physicians lack of in-clinic visits and subsequent modulation of insulin doses could also have been a contributory factor in the worsening of glucose control herein comes the crucial role of teleconsultations in day-to-day diabetes care 3738 with smartphones being a norm in most households there seems to be no dearth of scope for teleconsultations in the present era patients can keep in touch with their routine physicians andor diabetes educators via teleconsultations aided by patient specified smbg values physicians can help fine-tune the insulin doses thereby avoiding prolonged periods of sustained hyperglycemia as well as recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia in fact the use of telemedicine in people with t1dm has been shown to provide similar efficacy and safety outcomes as face-to-face visits 39 in addition teleconsultations can be a means of imparting diabetes self-management education to the people with dm amid the ongoing pandemic physicians could help people with t1dm choose the type and nature of the physical activity guide them by sharing sample exercise videos and reinforce the need to remain physically active at each virtual interaction 8 a minor recommendation would be to perform a total of 60 min of physical activityday 40 it could be divided between aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening activity simple aerobic activities that can be pursued at home include brisk walking in the terrace lawn balcony or treadmills if available stationary cycling stationary jogging and gardening could be performed as well similarly muscle-strengthening activities that could be performed at home include bodyweight exercises like push-ups squats sit-ups and resistance exercises in the form of lifting lightweights like buckets half-filled with water or bags filled with sand 8we do respect the limitations of the study first we used a qualitative method of interview using open-ended questions rather than taking help of closed-ended questionnaires that are commonly employed in surveys however using closed-ended questions would have limited the responses of the participants and we would have missed a few responses in the absence of relevant questions this would have been all the more relevant while enquiring about the problems being faced by the patients in the real-life setting using open-ended questions ensured that we were able to obtain a wide range of responses from the participants second we recruited only young adults with t1dm and not children or adolescents 18 years this ensured that we could obtain the viewpoints of the patients per se and not their parentscaregivers third the results of the study are based on interviews conducted in only 30 young adults with t1dm residing in a city of north india hence the findings cannot be generalized to people with t1dm residing in other parts of the country fourth we did not compare the absolute smbg values before and during the lockdown lastly we did not assess the psychological health of the participants people with dm already tend to have varying degrees of negative emotions such as depression and anxiety which is expected to get aggravated amid the stress of an ongoing pandemic 4142 unhealthy emotions would in turn worsen glycemic control amid the pandemic 43in conclusion young adults with t1dm lack robust awareness about covid-19 most of the patients were finding it difficult to maintain good glycemic control in spite of no major changes in diet or treatment regime suboptimal glucose profile could be explained based on the limitation of physical activity as reported by the majority of the participants increasing awareness and imparting diabetes self-management education via digitalprint media as well as via virtual clinics is the dire need of the hourthis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe authors declare that there is no conflict of interestthe ongoing outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy 1 2 3 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern as of 10 march 2020 more than 105 countries 114253 cases of covid-19 and 4000 deaths have been reported all over the world of which the number of confirmed patients in china has gradually decreased but is increasing rapidly in other countries especially in italy south korea and iran and there are lots of doctors engaged in combating it 45 the sars-cov-2 was first reported in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from three patients in wuhan jinyintan hospital and was confirmed as the cause of covid-19 on january 24 2020 6 after deep examining the full-length genome we found that the virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree 7 and is a new human-infecting beta-coronavirus which had previously not been detected in humans or animals it is named covid-19 by the who and sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov 8 it shares more than 8799  identity sequencing with the bat sars-like coronavirus and it shares more than 80  identity nucleotide with the original sars epidemic virus 9 10 11 coronavirus spike s glycoproteins promote entry into cells they are the main target of antibodies and bind with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in humans in a manner similar to sars-cov 12 13 14 however the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s1s2 subunits which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from sars-cov and sars-related covs 1516 at present research reports that the incubation period in most people range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 56 days but the incubation period may even be as long as 24 days 17 the reproductive number r0 for sars-cov-2 although still preliminary is estimated between 2 and 3 suggesting a higher pandemic potential than sars 18 fever or cough may be the major symptom but asymptomatic individuals have also been identified as potential sources of infection 19 at present we think that the new coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact but transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible 20 a report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding 21 although viral rna is found in stool whether it can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route still needs to be confirmed by subsequent investigations 2223 recently some patients were found to be re-positive after being treated with negative nucleic acid tests twice and symptoms disappeared it is difficult for us to decrease the severity of covid-19 owing to the complex structure and unclear physiological mechanism with the increasing number of confirmed cases the clinical investigation of patients and antiviral treatment solution has been insufficient and there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease in order to prove more accurate conclusions on the prevalence of comorbidity and relation of clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with covid-19 we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single arm meta-analysis to describe epidemiological clinical characteristics complications and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-ncov infection and to compare the severity between diabetes or hypertension and non-diabetes or non-hypertension patients our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov infectiona computerized search spanning january1 1980 to march 10 2020 was conducted in medline sino med embase and cochrane library databases the following search terms were used in all possible combinations corona virus disease-2019 mesh or 2019 novel coronavirus mesh or sars-cov-2 mesh or covid-19 mesh or 2019-ncov mesh the search was limited to human subjects there was no language limitation the titles and abstracts of potentially relevant studies identified by the computerized search were reviewed full-text articles were obtained for detailed evaluation and eligible studies were included in the systematic review the inclusion criteria were the following randomized controlled trial clinical trials and series cases patients who were of either sex and had been diagnosed with covid-19 all patients with laboratory-identified sars-cov-2 infection who had had both real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid positive in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract and ct scanning of the lung inclusion of the epidemiological clinical characteristics laboratory and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcome clear description of the clinical characteristics such as comorbidities including hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and malignancy and the signs and symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea clear description of the outcomes including the major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiac injuryaci acute kidney injuryaki shock and incidence of severity and mortalitythe exclusion criteria were the following absence of clinical characteristics treatment outcome clinical experience and case reportstwo authors independently extracted data by reviewing all titles and abstracts of the searched papers if any disagreement on the choice of the literature exists a third evaluator will join in to make the decision the following information was recorded from the included trials first author year of publication number of participants and residence of patients basic data about gender age and diagnosis were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the proportion of comorbidity such as diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and malignancy the proportion of symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea the proportion of clinical complications including ards aci aki and shock and the severity and mortalitytwo readers independently extracted and reviewed the data from the enrolled studies to ensure consistency the quality of the included studies was assessed by the newcastleottawa scale in order to objectively evaluate the publication bias of the included studies the egger test with p  005 as the existence of publication bias was performed and those with larger values were considered as having no publication biasthe single arm meta-analysis of proportions and 95 ci was calculated for the clinical symptoms complication outcome and for each of the selected comorbidities using stata 150 the presence of heterogeneity among the identified studies cochrans q and the extent of heterogeneity i 2 index were examined as described previously all original data included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to normal distribution and then analyzed in stata the initial conclusion obtained by meta-analysis was then restored using formula psintp2 2 to reach final conclusionwe performed sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the results and investigate the influence of each study by omitting a single study sequentially using the egger test we found no evidence of bias in any of the lag periodsthe initial 1057 citations were identified based on a study of the subject and a summary of the literature of which 694 articles were thereafter excluded because of duplication after reviewing the title and abstract of the remaining 81 studies only 34 full-text studies were evaluated for further assessment and 13 obviously irrelevant records were excluded eventually 21 clinical studies 61724 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 were consistent with the inclusion requirements a detailed study flow-diagram is shown in fig 1
 the basic characteristics and quality of the included studies were illustrated in table 1
twenty-one studies were selected with a total of 47344 patients 24419 male and 22925 females representing approximately 40  of the who confirmed one clinical trial investigated the characteristics of patients in singapore and all others came from china mainly in wuhan systematic analysis of the studies describing the epidemiological demographic and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reporting of the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases in the infectious disease was undertaken the number of cases in the selected studies varied by approximately 3722-fold and ranged from 12 to 44672 cases the sex ratio male to female was 106 and the overall average age of the subjects was greater than 40 years forty-one cases reported in jinyintan hospital are the earliest confirmed cases patients treated in wenzhou hospital almost are mild but xiaobo yang et al reported 52 cases with covid-19 that were all critical patients all studies detailed the pre-treatment biochemical characteristics and subsequent treatmenteighteen studies reported the comorbidity of diabetes only 7 of them introduced the proportion of severity 14 studies reported hypertension and 6 of them introduced the proportion of severity 13 studies reported malignant and 12 studies reported cad with regard to symptoms 20 studies recorded fever and cough 12 studies reported fatigue and 15 studies reported dyspnea seven studies recorded the complication of ards and aci and shock was recorded in 4 and 5 studies respectively fifteen studies showed critical patients and 12 research reported mortality all studies provided incidence data of at least one kind of comorbidity symptom or complication sixteen forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of comorbidities in covid-19 from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings meta-analysis of the identified studies showed that the most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever 856  95ci 813899  and cough 657  95ci 601714  followed by fatigue 424  95ci 322526  and shortness of breath 214  95ci 153275  fig 2
 there was significant heterogeneity cochrans q in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the examined studies p  0001 with an i2 index varying from 874  to 951  the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension comorbidities was 77  95ci 6193  and 156  95ci 126186  respectively the incidence of cardiovascular disease and malignancy was 47  95ci 3162  and 12  95ci 0518  respectively fig 3
 the case complications including ards risk ranged from 56 to 132  with the pooled estimate at 94  acute cardiac injury 58  95ci 07108  acute kidney injury 21  95ci 0637  and shock 47  95ci 0986  were also present fig 4
 the risks of severity and mortality rate ranged from 126 to 235  and from 20 to 44  with pooled estimates at 180 and 32  respectively the percentage of severe cases in diabetes and hypertension cases was 445  95ci 270619  and 417  95ci 264569  respectively fig 5
sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of pooled results among the 21 studies the significant results were not obviously altered after sequentially omitting each study in the pooled results comparing the incidence of mortality after excluding the report by chaolin huang et al the heterogeneity decreased significantly or  0719 95  ci  02771865 p  0497 i  28  and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing the ards rate between the two groups hence it was regarded as a result of heterogeneity likewise the other studies were considered as the source of heterogeneity because the heterogeneity significantly changed and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing ards between the two groups when each of these studies were excluded from the pooled results comparing the incidence of ards a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the exclusion of this study would alter the result and exclusion of this study from the meta-analysis did not substantially influence the resultsin this part of the study ards was used to assess publication bias egger test results showed pr  jzj  100 therefore we believe that the risk of publication bias is low in this meta-analysisthe outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by who by march 10 2020 the epidemic had spread to 25 countries around the world in accordance with the experience of china surgical masks are in widespread use which is beneficial to prevent the acquisition of covid-19 in addition italy started taking measures to block traffic and lockdown villages with the rising incidence of covid-19 all over the world feasible and effective messaging about the clinical characteristics of covid-19 is greatly needed therefore the focus of this analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms comorbidity complications and different outcomes in china and singapore the meta-analysis identified 21 published studies that assessed this proportion there are few published rcts because of the rapid development of the epidemic and there are limited medical resources in addition to the presence of uncontrollable risk during treatment much of the evidence of effects cannot be adequately studied in randomized trials such as long-term and rare outcomes therefore we analyzed all retrospective studies in this study for the main results we found that the cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults and there is no difference in susceptibility between male and female fever is the most common symptom in patients with 2019-ncov infection the most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the rapid development of severe illness ards and aci may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery the severity and mortality of patients with 2019-ncov infection is lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers but the prevalence of covid-19 is much higher than sars and the merstwo coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more critical disease the sars coronavirus in 20022003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012 43 44 45 a lot of studies have reported the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 but there is a lack of studies on the relation of severity and mortality with comorbidity similarly there is no meta-analysis published on complications for patients covid-19 infected therefore this is a novel systematic review and meta-analysis due to the inadequate evidence we present this meta-analysis by consolidating multiple studies to enable enhanced clinical decision making in the future we report here a cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection patients had serious sometimes fatal complications and were admitted to the designated hospital clinical presentations greatly resemble sars-cov patients with severe illness developed ards aki aci or shock and required icu admission and oxygen therapyhowever despite a comprehensive analysis there are also many limitations that should be taken into consideration in our meta-analysis first the studies included in the meta-analysis were not all rcts second in the literature-included studies the treatment of every hospital is not completely similar third owing to the treatment by grading of mild ordinary and critical the severity of patients in different hospitals varies greatly in addition as the cause and physio pathological mechanism was unknown at the onset of emerging infections the treatment in wuhan was only based on clinical experience leading to a higher complication and mortality fourth partial missing information in a few articles may lead to biased results we have attempted to contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data moreover clinical and methodological heterogeneities were observed in several parameters in the meta-analysis given the variation in intervention techniques patient composition and preferences among different cities true heterogeneity and poor methodological quality could also lead to an asymmetric plot in the future larger higher quality clinical trials should be conducted and we will conduct a more detailed subgroup analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity to obtain a more reliable conclusion and more effort should be made to answer these questions in future studiescovid-19 is an emerging infectious disease of global public health concern our results note the similarity of clinical symptoms and complications between covid-19 and previous beta-coronavirus infections the incidence of severity and mortality of covid-19 is much higher than that of ordinary influenza and the prevalence of chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension is rising as populations age and lifestyle and dietary habits change in addition we found that diabetes and hypertension are closely related to severity and mortality improving the protection against covid-19 in persons with chronic disorders is essential last but not least there is a need to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health-care workers thus preventing transmission amplification events and preventing further international spreadthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

and ck-mb  63 were independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized covid-19 patients to our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the prognostic factors of severe covid-19 in koreadiabetes mellitus is a major public health issue with an estimated global prevalence of 93 in 201910 a population-based cohort study showed that type 2 diabetes increased the risk of death associated with pneumonia and hyperglycemia on admission was associated with increased mortality for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with community-acquired pneumonia11 yang et al12 reported that diabetes and ambient hyperglycemia are independent risk factors for death and morbidity in sars patients diabetes also results in immune dysregulation and more severe and prolonged lung pathology in middle east respiratory syndrome13 the main mechanisms underlying the poorer clinical outcomes in cases of infections associated with diabetes mellitus are as follows 1 decreased t lymphocyte response 2 decreased neutrophil function 3 disorders of humoral immunity and 4 depression of the antioxidant system14 in a recent study covid-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes were shown to be at greater risk of severe disease as assessed by organ damage inflammatory factors and hypercoagulability in addition covid-19 patients with diabetes are at high risk for disease progression15 the results of the present study suggested that the progression of covid-19 is influenced by diabetes mellitus physicians should pay close attention to whether diabetic patients with covid-19 show rapid clinical deteriorationbody temperature is one of the variables included in the pneumonia severity index16 and systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs17 which can predict clinical outcomes in pneumonia the febrile response is thought to be mediated by endogenous factors called endogenous pyrogens pyrogenic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor tnf interleukin il-1 il-6 and interferons ifns are released in response to exogenous stimuli such as bacterial or viral products and toxins18 in covid-19 the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1 il-4 il-6 il-10 ifn- and tnf- are significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases19 the results of the present study suggested that critical covid-19 patients have elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines which increase body temperaturelow peripheral oxygen saturation was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for severe covid-198 many covid-19 patients experience rapid respiratory failure and hypoxemia without any signs of dyspnea which is referred to as silent hypoxemia20 this unique characteristic of covid-19 makes it difficult to predict clinical deterioration accurately using traditional scores such as quick sequential organ failure assessment and sirs as covid-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease medical staff tend to have less contact with patients therefore the discovery of a worsening condition in patients may be delayed from this viewpoint peripheral oxygen saturation measured immediately upon hospitalization through pulse oximetry can be used as a convenient and accurate marker for the prediction of clinical deterioration in covid-19cardiac injury is associated with death and severity of covid-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in the systemic review of the 28 studies with 4189 confirmed covid-19 patients severe covid-19 infection was associated with high cardiac injury related markers such as troponin ck-mb and myoglobin and also cardiac injury in covid-19 were related with higher mortality or 385 95 ci 213696 p  000121 it has been known that the sars-cov-2 invades human cells via the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 ace2 is expressed in the lung heart esophagus kidney bladder and ileum thus organs that express ace2 are vulnerable to sars-cov-2 infection22 therefore the measurement of cardiac damage markers on admission is needed in patients with covid-19 which predict the prognosis of covid-19there are several chinese studies demonstrating the risk factors for severity of covid-19 li et al5 reported that elder age hypertension high cytokine levels and high ldh levels were associated with severe covid-19 inpatients in wuhan a study in anhui china revealed that low fingertip oxygen saturation and decreased cd4 cell count were independent risk factors for severe covid-19 patients8 diabetes and maximum body temperature admission were risk factors for progression of covid-191523 the predictors of severe disease progression on korean patients and those in chinese patients were not much differentthis study had several limitations first this was a retrospective study conducted in a single center in korea which subjected only hospitalized patients therefore these results cannot be generalized to all covid-19 patients second antiviral agents and corticosteroid usage were not included as variables in this study our research focused on the baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory findings related to worsening of the patients condition due to severe disease and not on treatment third selection bias could not be avoided because population-based data were not used the disease severity of patients may vary between hospitals in the same region fourth proinflammatory cytokines and early cd8 t-cell response that can be associated with disease severity were not measured in this studyin conclusion we found that the presence of diabetes mellitus body temperature  378c peripheral oxygen saturation  92 and ck-mb  63 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized covid-19 patients the likelihood of progression to severe covid-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors appropriate assessment of prognostic factors and close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the appropriate time in high-risk patients may reduce the case fatality rate of covid-19the covid19 pandemic is emerging around the world with a devastating force

 majority of all people especially when they are young are suffering from a subclinical course of covid19 and 20 among them need to be hospitalized it should be seriously noted that most of our patients in the covid19 ward did not only suffer from type2 diabetes the largest amount of them had an age of more than 65 years old with various other diseases as well obesity priory treated tumours hypertension heart failure kidney function impairmentour community hospitals situated in the northern antwerp region belgium were restructured in covid19 hospitals in just a few days permitting a lot of patients to be admitted and pushing aside regular inside hospital care with exception of critical care medicine triage and making the covid19 diagnosis were performed in the emergency room patients with a respiratory failure expected being artificially ventilated in some hours were directed towards the intensive care unit icu all other patients screening positive for covid19 with either coronavirus pcr or ct went to the covid19 ward for close observation single in an isolated room our hospitals contained three covid19 wards and each ward was homing fortyfive patients most of the time in the current epidemic marchapril 2020 we recognized two phases for patients who were admitted in the covid19 ward a first one from patients coming out of the general population and a second one from patients out of other institutions like nursing homes and rehabilitation centres the mortality rate appeared to be apparently higher in the second phase own observation our data are currently collectedas found repeatedly in prior studies from china and italy patients with diabetes have a similar risk of being infected with the coronavirus as subjects from the general population figure 1
2
 
3
 however the moment covid19positive patients with preexistent diabetes are hospitalized their clinical course is often more complicated with a subsequently higher morbidity and mortality rate
4
 this is theoretically explained by more expression of ace2 receptors in the lungs during hyperglycaemic states diabetes animal models
5
 and in vitro models showed a higher facilitated entrance of coronavirus through these ace2 receptors in rodent diabetes models the level of expression of ace2 receptors is regulated differently among distinctive organs eg more expression in kidney cortex compared to the heart with an upregulated expression in a state of glycaemia
6
 however administration of insulin to lower the high glycaemic states did not decrease tissue ace2 receptor expression in the lung only the circulating ace2 protein decreased
7
 translating these rodentderived results towards human conditions is not easy to make and is still ongoing in actual research however these first rodentderived results motivated us to prevent hyperglycaemia in patients admitted in our covid19 ward preventing them from respiratory failurein our covid19 wards all patients start recording capillary daytime glucose levels the first 24 hours of admission hba1c measurement was performed in all covid19 patients with a disturbed glycaemic level 140 mgdl or 77 mmoll in order to diagnose preexistent type2 diabetes or to define their glucose control all patients with covid19 had their glucose levels strictly titrated with subcutaneous basalbolus insulin therapy in line with the adaaace and endocrine society guidelines
8
 
9
 dealing with in hospital glucose control seriously ill patients with avoidance of glycaemia less than stopping all oral antidiabetic drugs for several considerations due to significant acute or chronic decrease in kidney function clearance 35 mlmin in many of our hospitalized patients biguanides and other glucoselowering drugs were all to be discontinued in elderly sulfonylurea is better avoided especially during acute disease and malnutrition a possible increased risk for pneumonia while using ddpivs is part of discussion
10
 in patients with covid19 the therapeutic use of steroids is very restricted and therefore steroidassociated glycaemia was a rare phenomenon in our covid19 ward patients using a glucose sensor such as that of medtronic should stop measuring glycaemia with this modality as paracetamol even in a low dose as 1 g could hinder accurate measurements and always start to measure capillary glucose levels with use of a finger prick paracetamol is often used in the covid19 wardnot only known patients with diabetes exert a disturbed daytime glucose profile as expected from prior literature almost a third of inhospital patients with a disturbed daytime glucose level have been diagnosed as a de novo diabetes hba1c at admission 65 using hba1c as a diagnostic cool was not always possible in the active phase of covid19 infection a large amount of patients displayed a significant anaemia due to systemic proinflammation in one case report the anaemia was successfully corrected with erythropoietin infusion
11

another large group of patients in the ward displayed a stressassociated hyperglycaemia in our covid19 population this last group was frequently overrepresented it is not known whether an acute rise in glucose levels could affect ace2 receptor expression at the alveolar endothelium or whether chronic hyperglycaemic conditions should be needed due to this lack of knowledge we treated both similar with insulin therapy during their stay in the wardin case of respiratory failure at the ward transition to the icu was performed and subcutaneous insulin is changed into intravenously administered insulin most patients remained however in our covid19 ward during a week and when they went home insulin could be stopped in almost all patients from our still limited experience covid19 patients with a preexistent diabetes and a wellcontrolled glycaemia hba1c before admission did not transfer more to icua moderate improvement in insulin sensitivity and lipid profile is observed after starting the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine
12
 therefore closely monitoring daytime glucose levels is recommended especially for them under insulin therapy in line with this fact one case report described a patient with a type1 diabetes and a severe hypoglycaemia
13
 in our covid19 ward we did not observe any accidents due to hypoglycaemia after hydroxychloroquine was started in the course of diseaseanother challenge will be in reopening society with presence of viral clusters and a low continuous viraemia amid its general population a lot of patients have been limited in their visits to caregivers in hospital during the active period of the covid19 pandemic some of them neglected alarming symptoms or high glucose levels because of fear being infected not daring to contact hospitals
14
 for instance we experienced a higher rate of patients presenting with complicated sepsis by a diabetic foot or not mentioning active coronary signs with a serious delay telemedicine or telephone consultations did not always prevent these late presentations with complicated disease making us to reconsider the real effectiveness of such applications in daily clinic especially in patients with a low health literacy or not native speaking despite that we were encouraged to do so by governmentrelated bodies and commercial companies the first period after reopening society most patients with diabetes and not hospitalized with covid19 should be treated more intensively in order to achieve their distinctive metabolic targets hba1c blood pressure ldlcholesterol et cetera not only to prevent cardiovascular risk how we were used to do today but also to prevent them for a complicated course in next coming covid19 outbreaks both immunization for influenza and the immune host response during respiratory viral infections showed different patterns in multiomics associations between insulinsensitive persons and insulinresistant persons prediabetes suggesting an impaired immune capacity in tackling viral respiratory infections
15
 as long as no efficient vaccine with subsequent group protection will be obtained covid19 outbreaks could be foreseen a cochrane analysis however showed that vaccines preventing influenza in the elderly with diabetes living in longterm care facilities and not in community could not significantly being effective and only reduces its mortal complications total mortality reduction such as bacterial pneumonia and hospitalizations
16
 with covid19 the viral pneumonia was rarely complicated with a bacterial infection making the comparison with prior incoherent literature concerning vaccines and covid19 in the elderly with diabetes even more a challenge with a certain doubt it may not be its simple panacea from recent observations the current antibody levels against the coronavirus in the general dutch population and a preselected belgium population are not passing 10 after the first corona peak marchapril 2020 so this underlines the need for original and fundamental research at covid19 and not just the trust to replicate prior concepts that may lead towards fast therapeutic achievementspatients with a low health literacy are more found among those with worse clinical outcomes
17
 in the netherland we found that about 20 of patients with a type2 diabetes express a less health literacy
18
 in prior studies not dealing with covid19 pandemic patients presentation in the emergency room is delayed compared to them with a higher health literacy public information is later translated and applied in this group of patients giving a more serious patients delay most patients with a lower health literacy are supported by others in their daily life activities and in their daily diabetes management in covid19 pandemic the availability of the other supporting person is much less present due to all kind of local measures restricting social contact such as quarantine or closure of schools with children at home hindering visiting mum or dad suffering diabetes
19
 these necessitate social restrictions during the covid19 pandemic will certainly affect negatively patients with a low health literacy with more risk to run into complicationspatients with an adrenal insufficiency are rare among patients entering the covid19 ward however one should not underestimate the hidden part of patients with a partial adrenal insufficiency for instance patients who used a high cumulative dose of steroids in rheumatoid disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could present with a disturbed stress response symptoms due to an impaired adrenal function especially under severe infectious stress as could be in the initial course of covid19
20
 against this specific background other special groups of patients should not be forgotten for instance patients with a high need for morphinelike drugs secondary adrenal insufficiency or those who are recently treated with the new anticancer drugs the immunemodulators with hypophysitis as secondary side effect secondary adrenal insufficiency
21
 these patients could be safely tested with a synacthen test in the covid19 ward in case of urgency such as a fast hemodynamic deterioration intravenous solucortef 50 mg three times a day could be started immediately without a synacthen testpatients with a primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency who already take hydrocortisone substitution before admission should be switched to intravenously administered hydrocortisone 50 mg three times a day
22
 diarrhoea and vomiting without fever may be symptoms related to covid19 infectionin case of a diabetes insipidus disease of the neuropituitary salt water balance should have full attention in covid19 patients one wants to avoid a hypervolemic condition and therefore the 24 hours volume and composition of applied intravenous solutions are strictly motivated aiming to achieve a cumulative 24 hours nil balance so the dose of desmopressin should be adjusted accordinglyas a disturbed thyroid function could negatively affect heart function and in the covid19 cytokine storm troponins are often elevated suggesting significant cardiac stress controlling the thyroid function is mandatory in the acute phase most deterioration in thyroid function is due to nonthyroid illness with no need for thyroxin substitution some of them use amiodarone mostly this gives not a significant orientation during their stay in the covid19 ward hyperthyroidism mostly due to a toxic adenoma is dealt with according to current guidelinespatients with covid19 who are admitted in the ward are a serious challenge for both junior and senior doctors numerous pathologies should be mastered in order to improve their outcomes and this demand a multidisciplinary approach metabolic disorders are often present they should be diagnosed and treated against the background of the covid19related cytokine storm that is characterizing the initial phase of diseaseboth authors have no conflict of interestin december 2019 many cases with an unknown pneumonia were reported in wuhan china 1 subsequently a beta-coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 was isolated from the lower respiratory tract samples of infected patients and the disease later declared by the world health organization as a pandemic was termed the novel coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies widely while the majority of patients present with a mild form of the disease severe cases may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards multiple organ failure and even death 2 3 4currently the diagnosis of covid-19 is confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr however chest computed tomography ct imaging has played a major role in the diagnosis and management of suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19 5 6 in addition various ct scores have been designed to assess the severity of disease 7 8 9 studies reporting the imaging findings of covid-19 on chest ct imaging have indicated that the most common findings are ground-glass opacities ggo and consolidation which mainly have a peripheral distribution 10 11 moreover chest ct severity scores are higher among severe cases of covid-19 compared with patients with mild disease 8 9 12according to the literature patients with comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease as well as older patients are prone to worse clinical outcomes and higher rates of complications associated with covid-19 3 13 14 studies from the previous pandemics including the influenza a h1n1 sars-cov and mers-cov pandemics indicated that diabetes and uncontrolled glycemia were significantly associated with disease severity and mortality in infected patients 15 16 17 for example a study evaluating the 2009 pandemic influenza a h1n1 virus found that the fasting plasma glucose fpg level of h1n1 patients on admission was significantly associated with disease severity 18 to this point the role of glycemic control in the prognosis of patients with coexistent diabetes and covid-19 is not clear in this study we aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and imaging findings between covid-19 patients with well-controlled diabetes and those with poorly-controlled diabeteswe conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients who were admitted to a tertiary care hospital in tehran iran with a suspicion of covid-19 infection from a total of 1357 patients with covid-19 admitted between february 2020 and april 2020 117 86 patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus dm and were included in our study diabetes mellitus was confirmed by reviewing patients medical records no exclusion criteria were considered for this study the included patients were classified as patients with well-controlled or poorly-controlled dm according to hemoglobin a1c hba1c levels recommended by the american diabetes association 19 patients with an hba1c level of more than 7 were regarded as patients with poorly-controlled dm while those with an hba1c level of equal to or less than 7 were considered as patients with well-controlled dmdue to the unavailability of rt-pcr kits for detection of sars-cov-2 early in the outbreak in iran patients who had clinical features and chest ct findings highly suggestive of covid-19 were considered as positive cases and thus were included in this study this study was approved by the ethics committee of shahid beheshti university of medical sciencesbaseline demographics of patients were retrieved by collecting data from patients electronic medical records in this study we assessed the underlying comorbidities hypertension and cardiovascular disease duration of diabetes smoking history and medications insulin oral hypoglycemic agents ohas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorangiotensin ii receptor blockers aceiarbs statin and diuretics of all participants individuals who had ceased smoking more than 10 years earlier were considered as non-smokers laboratory tests included the total count of leukocytes and lymphocytes hba1c lactate dehydrogenase ldh c-reactive protein crp magnesium mg phosphorus p calcium ca cardiac troponin i procalcitonin pct d-dimer 25-oh-vitd and zinc in addition rt-pcr assay was performed on nasopharyngeal specimens for sars-cov-2 detection in all patients with taqman premix takara takara dalian china considering the protocols provided by the manufacturerall patients underwent chest ct examinations after admission and all ct scans were reported by the same radiologist with years of experience in ct imaging to reduce potential bias the chest ct severity score was defined by the summation of individual scores from 5 lung lobes scores of 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 were respectively assigned for each lobe if pulmonary involvement was 0 less than 5 5-25 26-49 50-75 or more than 75 of each region the range of total severity score was from 0 no involvement to 25 maximum involvementthe predominant patterns on chest ct imaging were classified into five groups ggo consolidation ggoconsolidation mixed reverse halo sign and crazy-paving other secondary ct findings such as cavity nodule pleural effusion pericardial effusion and lymphadenopathy lap 10mm were also recorded distribution of lung lesions was grouped into three categories peripheral peribronchovascular and perihilar also lung opacifications fell into three different categories in terms of morphology round linear or non-specific opacitiesnon-normally distributed continuous data were expressed as median interquartile range iqr and categorical data were presented as number percentage normal distribution was evaluated by using the shapiro-wilk test chi-square test was used for comparison of proportions between groups the differences of parametric and non-parametric continuous data were compared between groups by using the independent samples t-test and mann-whitney u test respectively all statistical analyses were performed by using the spss software version 23 spss inc chicago il usa p-values less than 005 were considered statistically significantthis study included 117 patients with covid-19 who had pre-existing type 2 dm the prevalence of diabetes among all patients with covid-19 was 86 totally 66 564 patients were male and the median age was 66 years iqr 55-75 years among the total population of patients with diabetes 93 795 patients had poor-controlled diabetes and 24 205 patients had well-controlled diabetes approximately 79 of the included patients tested positive for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr the clinical and laboratory findings of patients are demonstrated in table 1
 as shown patients with well-controlled dm were significantly older than those with poorly-controlled dm p0001 also the distribution of male and female patients differed significantly between the two groups p004 while the majority of patients in the well-controlled dm group were females male patients constituted a higher percentage among patients with poorly-controlled dm the median hba1c value among all patients with diabetes was 86 iqr 75-11 when comparing comorbidities between the two groups no significant difference was observed among all patients with coexistent diabetes and covid-19 62 53 patients had hypertension duration of diabetes was not statistically different between patients with well-controlled and poorly-controlled dm p077 approximately half of the patients recovered from covid-19 but 222 of the patients died during hospitalization in addition about 18 experienced ards during the course of disease clinical outcomes however were not significantly different between patients with well-controlled and poorly-controlled dm p005 considering the medications used by patients for their underlying diabetes the use of aceiarbs or insulin did not differ between the two groups p025 and p018 respectively among laboratory parameters 56 615 patients of the total population had lymphocytopenia on admission only calcium and 25-oh-vitd levels differed significantly between the two groups p004 for boththe imaging findings of patients on chest ct are presented in table 2
 the median total ct severity score was 11 and 105 among patients with well-controlled and poorly-controlled dm respectively p033 the highest ct scores were observed in the right lower lobes of patients in both groups the most common chest ct pattern was ggo 513 followed by consolidation 35 in addition 855 of the cases had lesions with a peripheral distribution on ct imaging whereas no perihilar distribution was detected in any patient in terms of morphology linear opacities were more frequently seen in patients with poorly-controlled dm however this finding had borderline significance p008 among 117 patients with covid-19 and diabetes 10 85 and 43 368 patients had pleural effusion and hyperinflation on ct imaging respectivelyafter comparing the proportion of patients who had a fatal outcome between those receiving aceiarbs and those who did not receive these medications we found that patients who were using aceiarbs had significantly higher rates of death and lower rates of recovery p003 for both ards was also more common among patients using aceiarbs although with borderline significance p008this study has several limitations first the number of cases in each group was markedly different which necessitates a careful interpretation of the results larger prospective studies among different populations are needed to explore the association between diabetes either well-controlled or poorly-controlled and imaging findings and clinical outcomes also as mentioned earlier we did not evaluate patients blood glucose tests during hospitalization and so our assumption of glycemic control in patients with diabetes was solely based on hba1c valuesthis retrospective single-center study showed that patients with well-controlled or poorly-controlled diabetes did not significantly differ in terms of clinical outcomes and chest ct severity scoresfundingthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsdeclarations of interestnonefor the past two decades pandemics of severe acute respiratory infections sari have been serious threats to global health causing significant morbidity and mortality reassorted novel strains of influenza viruses and coronaviruses continue to arise rendering vaccinations - if developed - less useful and posing increased risks to humans two prominent viruses  2009 influenza a h1n1 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov  have markedly affected humans h1n1 since the 2009 pandemic has caused about 284500 deaths both directly via respiratory infections and indirectly from the cardiovascular diseases secondary to bacterial infections1 in addition mers-cov since its first emergence in 2012 has infected 1600 individuals causing 574 deaths and was reported in 26 countries although the vast majority of reported cases originated from the arabian peninsula2h1n1 and mers-cov both target the respiratory tract and share many similar clinical symptoms the most common symptoms are fever cough shortness of breath and sore throat3-8 followed always by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea37-9 both diseases often lead to complications such as pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome organ failure and even death469 complications mostly lie within the respiratory system with organ failure commonly noted in the respiratory system followed by renal and cardiovascular systems5 individuals infected with h1n1 usually belong to those aged between 21 and 50 years45 and have a mean age in the early 40s35 mers-cov on the other hand mostly infects older adults with a median age of 50 years10 this difference was hypothesized to be related to the development of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza viruses from previous exposures to seasonal influenza in elder people5 another difference between h1n1 and mers-cov relates to the length of the incubation period h1n1 has a short incubation period between 1 and 2 days11 whereas mers-cov has a much longer period of 5 days10many infected individuals exhibit comorbidities eg diabetes hypertension asthma and obesity rendering them more susceptible to complications3-7 diabetes is one of the known documented contributing host-related risk factor in both h1n1 and mers-cov severe cases and is frequent in individuals developing fatal disease complications4-7 this observation may suggest an etiological relationship between diabetes and acute viral respiratory infections diabetes and its related conditions downregulate the innate and humoral immune systems by reducing the function of t cells and neutrophils12 hyperglycemia impairs critical components of innate immunity in vitro such as chemotaxis phagocytosis and the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages and lead to secondary infections13 the direct influence of diabetes however on acute respiratory infections still needs more research to estimate the frequency of diabetes in severe viral conditions and to elucidate the etiologic role on diabetes in disease severity14 the present study was undertaken to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature to describe the prevalence of diabetes in two of the emerging severe acute respiratory infections such as h1n1 and mers-cov and to explore its possible contribution to the severity and complication of the two viral conditionsa search was conducted in pubmed ovid medline embase and embase classic databases to the last week of july 2015 using the search terms mesh h1n1 or mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus and diabetes the search resulted in 123 articles selected for title and abstract review as they satisfied our selection criteria see below we limited the studies into those in humans and excluded reports published as review articles letters case studies editorials conference abstracts vaccination trials or family-based studies after eliminating duplicate listings and only considering articles in full text a total of 44 peer-reviewed original studies were selected for full text review full article review resulted in the further exclusion of 8 reports that were not documenting the prevalence of diabetes in h1n1 or mers-cov ie no association studies examining only a small number of travellers as a case report n2 subjects reporting seasonal influenza alone reviewing already reported cases mers-cov or simply documenting national surveys a bibliography search of the remaining articles identified two additional studies a total of 38 peer- reviewed articles 29 studies for h1n13-514-39 and 9 for mers-cov6-940-44 were identified for this article figure 1the abstracts of the identified studies were independently reviewed by two readers ab and sj differences were resolved through discussions for a consensus to be reached percentage agreement and cohens kappa k statistic45 were calculated and interpreted in accordance with landis and kochs benchmarks46 for assessing the agreement between reviewers as poor 0 slight 00-020 fair 021-040 moderate 041-060 substantial 061-080 and excellent 081-10 the agreement on the inclusion between the two reviewers was 86 with k072 95 ci 058-085the methodological quality of each study was evaluated as previously described47 with some modification quality of the study was based on four criteria a the number of study subjects n at least the median of 157 for h1n1 and 17 for mers-cov b comprehensive reporting of patients demographic information c describing a minimum of 3 disease-associated symptoms and d reporting at least 2 comorbidities in addition to diabetes for each criterion each study was given a score 0 or 1 with 1 fulfilling the criteria the total score was calculated for each study score range 0-4 quality scores of 1 2 3 and 4 were considered poor fair good and very good respectivelydata extracted from the selected studies included the first authors name publication date country dates of recruitment ethnicity total sample size divided to males and females age prevalence of symptoms including fever shortness of breath sore throat cough and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apacheii and percentage of comorbidities at the time of presentation including obesity immunosuppression or hiv and heart conditions such as hypertension cardiovascular diseases andor coronary arterial diseases tables 1 and 2 weighted average was used to calculate the average age and the overall prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities publication bias was assessed both by the visual inspection of funnel plot figure 2 and by eggers test eggers test is widely used to assess the tendency for the effects estimated in small sample size studies to differ from those estimated in larger studies the results of eggers test are presented in terms of bias coefficient to measure the prevalence of diabetes in the two viral conditions we extracted the proportion of the disease in the reported cases of severe respiratory infections a subgroup analysis was carried out by region only for the h1n1 studies table 3 region subgroup analysis for mers-cov was not doable since all the identified studies were conducted on saudi populations with one study of pooled analysis where regioncountry designation was not possible the primary outcome measure was to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes in h1n1 and mers-cov cases the meta-analysis of proportions and 95 cis was calculated for the identified studies figure 3 and in a subgroup analysis within each region table 3 meta-analysis tests were conducted using the openmeta analyst version 1010 a free cross-platform open-source program48 we used binary random-effects model since we assumed that the relationship between diabetes and severe respiratory infection is varied across populations t-test was used to compare between average age in h1n1 and mers-cov since this factor was normally distributed in the two sets of studies mann-whitney utest was employed to compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities between the two diseases as these conditions were not normally distributed to assess whether there is true heterogeneity among the selected studies and that all the studies are evaluating the same effect we used the q test49
q test only informs about the presence versus the absence of heterogeneity and does not report on the extent of such heterogeneity therefore we calculated the i2 index to complement the q test and quantify the degree of heterogeneity among studies50 given the poor power of q test to detect true heterogeneity among a small number of studies we also quantified the true heterogeneity by estimating the between-study variance in the random-effects model 2 as previously described51 p005 was considered to be statistically significant forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of diabetes in h1n1 and mers-cov severity from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findingsthe present systematic review examines the relationship between diabetes and the h1n1 and mers-cov a total of 38 studies that report the prevalence of diabetes in h1n1 n92948 cases from 29 studies table 1 and mers-cov n308 cases from 9 studies table 2 were selected the funnel plot figure 2 demonstrated a non-symmetrical distribution of the effect size of each study on either side of the pooled estimate this seemingly non-symmetrical appearance of the plot suggested evidence of publication bias eggers test also supported this notion particularly in mers-cov studies where the bias coefficient was not statistically significant - given the assumption for evidence of small-study effects is based on p01 p013 for the h1n1 studies and p0065 for the mers-cov studies these findings are supported by the significant heterogeneity p0001 among the selected studies see below according to our quality scoring criteria see above the majority of the studies were between fair score 2 12 reports and good score 3 16 reports quality with 7 studies that fulfilled all quality scoring criteria score 4 very good within the selected studies sex-ratio malefemale in the majority of the h1n1 reports was 11 whereas it was 21 in the mers-cov cases the average age of h1n1 cases 36260 years range 11-545 years was significantly younger than mers-cov cases 54374 years range 36-66 years t-test p00004 the prevalence of fever shortness of breath sore throat and cough was not statistically different between h1n1 and mers-cov cases from the two sets of studies mann-whitney u test at p005 we observed a non-statistically significant 2-fold higher frequency of obesity 30 kgm2 in the mers-cov patients compared to their h1n1 counterparts 17642 vs 7728 the combined frequencies of cardiovascular diseases hypertension and cardio-artillery diseases were 3-fold higher in mers-cov cases than in h1n1 31359 vs 7227 p00004meta-analyses for the proportion of diabetes in h1n1 and mers-cov are shown in figures 3 and 4 respectively the overall proportion of diabetes in h1n1 is 15 95 ci 12-17 36-fold lower than its proportion in mers-cov 54 95ci 28-80 the two sets of studies displayed a significant heterogeneity p0001 among the selected studies q test 1943 for h1n1 vs 1698 for mers-cov additionally the degree of heterogeneity among studies was statistically significant p0001 and comparable between the two sets of studies i2 index 986 for h1n1 vs 953 for mers-cov the between-study variance in the random-effects model was markedly lower among the h1n1 studies 20003 than the mers-cov reports 20134subgroup analysis by region for h1n1 studies table 3 showed that the frequency of diabetes in h1n1 from asia and north america 18-20 p0001 is 2-fold higher than its prevalence in the cases recruited from europe and south america 10 p0001 cases from africa 14 showed a non-significant slightly lower diabetes prevalence compared to those from asia and north america it should be noted however that the frequency estimate from africa was developed only from two studies compared to 8 and 10 studies from asia and north america respectively and 4 studies from each of europe and south america the heterogeneity tests for the studies included in all regional sub-analyses exhibited significant overall heterogeneity q test p0009 degree of heterogeneity among studies i2 index and between-study variance in the random-effects model 2 testthe present systematic review evaluates the frequency of diabetes in sari conditions such as h1n1 and mers-cov we observed a large difference between the volume of literature and total number of subjects evaluated for each condition and identified 29 studies for h1n1 with 92948 subjects and 9 for mers-cov with 308 patients about 60 of the selected studies 23 out of 38 had a quality score between good and very good tables 1 and 2 this indicates that a large set of the studies had a sufficient enough number subjects to substantiate the outcome and have provided a comprehensive reporting of patients demographic information furthermore the majority of the selected studies reported a set of disease-associated symptoms and comorbidities that permitted developing a comprehensive profile of the infectious disease and its complication this difference reflects the discrepancy between the two diseases in their global h1n1 versus regional mers-cov spread and the period during which they emerged immediately following its outbreak in 2009 the h1n1 triple reassortant swine influenza viruses contained genes from avian swine and human influenza a viruses5354 and sustained a rapid between-human transmission to spread globally52 on the other hand in 2012 the emergence of mers-cov was to a great extent contained within the arabian peninsula55 and dromedary camels were identified as the intermediate host56 with a closely related virus sequences found in bats57 apart from a number of nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers caring for mers-cov patients little evidence has been initially reported for sustained person-to-person transmission58 however during the 2015 mers-cov outbreak in the republic of korea it was demonstrated that among 186 cases 832 of the transmission events were linked to only 5 super-spreaders all of whom had pneumonia at presentation and contacted hundreds of people adding evidence to the person-to-person transmission in mers-cov59the characteristic pattern of transmission and spread of h1n1 and mers-cov may have resulted in a distinctive sex-ratio for each condition mers-cov cases exhibited a sex-ratio malefemale of 21 twice that noted for h1n1 cases tables 1 and 2 the male predominance of mers-cov reflects the higher likelihood of exposure to the infectious agent in males than in females in middle eastern cultures in addition most males who tested positive for the virus and died also had underlying medical conditions which could explain the severity of cases in older males60 in agreement mers-cov cases were significantly older 54374 years than their h1n1 36260 years counterparts the average age of h1n1 patients is similar to that in h5n1 cases where 90 percent of the subjects were 40 years or younger61 as noted with h5n1 cases it can be estimated that 15-20 of elder people may have residual immunity against this h1n1 flu strain following their life-time exposures to multiple influenza outbreaks61-64 this immunogenicity does not apply to coronaviruses and may explain the younger average age of h1n1 cases compared to mers-cov cases indeed it was proposed over 60 years ago that repeated exposures to antigenic variants of influenza viruses may result in antibodies recognizing a large number of common flu antigens and develop a reinforced immunity that lower the risk of infection with newly emerging variants65the clinical presentations of sari generally include respiratory symptoms such as fever new onset or exacerbation of cough breathing difficulty and sore throat severe illnesses may vary from pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome encephalitis myocarditis or other severe and life-threatening complications66 the frequency of fever shortness of breath sore throat and cough was similar between h1n1 and mers-cov cases in contrast underlying medical conditions and comorbidities varied significantly between the two viral conditions patients with mers-cov had 2-fold higher rates of obesity p005 and 3-fold higher combined frequencies of cardiovascular diseases hypertension and cardio-artillery diseases p005 tables 1 and 2 the varying rates of comorbidities between h1n1 and mers-cov cases may relate to their different patterns of regional spread cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent in the middle east67 than in many regions of the world6768 this observation also applies to obesity although the lower prevalence of obesity in males from the arabian peninsula versus females69 and their higher predominance in mers-cov patients see above together may have been combined to render the occurrence of obesity in mers-cov non-significantly different from that in h1n1 the increased risk of developing severe h1n1 and mers-cov complications in people with underlying chronic diseases was similarly reported in seasonal influenza a recent study noted that compared to subjects with no comorbidities severe cases of influenza are more likely to manifest with obesity or for mortality 274 95ci 156-480 cardiovascular diseases 292 176-486 hypertension 149 110-201 and neuromuscular disease 268 191-37570 more studies examining the link between sari and metabolic syndrome-related complications such as obesity and cardiovascular conditions are needed to evaluate their contribution to the severity of infectious diseasesthe overall proportion of diabetes was 4-fold higher in mers-cov cases 54 than in their h1n1 counterparts 15 figures 3 and 4 in agreement odds ratio for severe h1n1 in diabetic subjects ranging from 22 to 4416192330 was 3-fold lower than for severe mers-cov or ranging from 72 to 157940 although at varying extents these findings implicate diabetes as a risk factor for sever mers-cov and h1n1 one reason for this difference may relate to the higher average age of mers-cov cases given that older age is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes71 although in younger middle eastern populations rates of diabetes and its risk factors67 are higher than those in older populations the disease prevalence has increased across all age groups rather than just in older adults in the region72 another possible explanation can be attributed to the high prevalence of diabetes in the middle east and the arabian peninsula67 - where mers-cov originated and spread - compared to its prevalence in other world regions68 similar increased rates of tuberculosis were noted in regions with high diabetes prevalence73 additionally subgroup analysis by region demonstrated that diabetes frequency in h1n1 cases from asia and north america is 2-fold higher than in those from europe and south america table 3 this coincides with the high prevalence of diabetes in asia and north america 12 compared to europe or south and central america 974 however despite the lines of evidence suggesting an influence of the region of viral spread on diabetes proportion in the severe cases of sari the rate of diabetes in mers-cov was still 3-fold higher than that in the h1n1 cases from asia 176 95 ci 121-231 p0001 table 3 - where diabetes rates are comparable to those in the regions of mers-cov this observation suggests that the higher prevalence of diabetes in mers-cov cases than in h1n1 may not be simply related to the regional differences in the viral spread and that an etiologic role of diabetes in severe mers-cov cases may exist distinctive from that in h1n1diabetes can impair the innate immune system75 and render individuals more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases and severe illnesses137576 for example during seasonal influenza outbreaks compared to healthy subjects diabetic patients were shown to have 6-fold higher risk of becoming critically ill and acquire hospitalization with 4-fold increased rates of pneumonia-related hospitalizations and a 3-fold elevated likelihood of dying of complications77 diabetes share several common features with infectious disorders and its complication such as the endothelial dysfunction the pro-inflammatory state and the attenuation of innate immune response75 the cytokine overload related to the th1 microbicidal action of ifn-  to th2 anti-inflammatory il-4 -5 -10 and -13 shift in severe viral infection when accompanied by the increased cytokine levels arising from diabetes both can be detrimental to the endothelium and lead to a range of subsequent complications78 dampened innate immunity and the shift from th1 to th2 responses were implicated in linking the high prevalence of allergy observed in fatal viral infections eg dengue fever79 furthermore diabetes can impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response76 where individuals become at increased risk of severe infectious disease outcome in support diabetes-associated hyperglycemia and cellular insulinopenia are known to impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response76 furthermore levels of hba1c 9 were linked to a 60 increased risk of pneumonia-related complications and hospitalization due to a lower immune response80 host defense to infection is largely mediated by cellular immunity and the synthesis of related cytokines such as ifn- and interleukins is downregulated in diabetes7581the present study has several limitations inspection of the funnel plot figure 2 and the eggers test indicates that publication bias may have been derived from the small-study effect ie the possibility of including small studies with spuriously overstated estimates while ignoring those without statistically significant effects that may have a lower possibility of being published furthermore the identified reports have shown 8-fold among-studies variance in the diabetes proportion for h1n1 004-035 figure 3 and mers-cov 01-08 figure 4 cases these inter-study differences may have contributed to the significant heterogeneity observed in our report additional sources of heterogeneity may relate to the large variation among studies in the sample size 19 to 70000 h1n1 cases and 5 to 161 mers-cov patients or the ethnic diversity of the study populations particularly within the h1n1 studies collected from 14 counties furthermore heterogeneous methodologies due to different study designs may have influenced the inter-study variation this observation may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of diabetes to severe h1n1 and mers-cov cases and render our results as a guide to generate more accurate estimates for national or international intervention strategies for severe sari conditions in diabetic subjects furthermore although the prevalence of diabetes is 15 in severe h1n1 cases and 54 in mers-cov it may not implicate causality and warrants further studies to identify the nature and extent of the coexistence between diabetes and each of the two respiratory infections another limitation is the low number of mers-cov cases and the narrow geographic region from which it was recruited compared to the h1n1 cases that rendered subgroup analysis by region unattainable for mers-cov cases this particular limitation may add more weight to the suggestion stipulating that the difference in diabetes prevalence between h1n1 and mers-cov can be attributable to the regional difference in spread the small number of mers-cov studies highlights the need to develop international collaborations that include cases from countries other than those in the arabian peninsula eg from korea where a few recent cases have been emerged recently a single study44 has examined mers-cov cases pooled from various countries but the findings were still limited by the small population size the reports identified in the present study did not distinguish between the prevalence of type 1 andor type 2 diabetes in h1n1 or mers-cov cases with the exception of three studies only in the h1n1 - but not mers-cov141735 all the identified reports have combined both types of diabetes despite their different characteristics etiological factors and clinical features cortes garcia et al14 and koegelenberg et al35 have clearly stated that the diabetic cases in their h1n1 series as type 2 cases jimenez-garcia et al17 on the other hand compared the demographic characteristics underlying medical conditions and in-hospital case fatality risk cfr in the type 1 prevalence 08 and type 2 prevalence 84 diabetic patients and reported a 2-fold higher cfr in type 2 cases than type 117 given this paucity of information it was challenging to distinguish between the two types of diabetes for their role in viral disease severity and complicationin conclusion the present study provides some evidence of a greater prevalence of diabetes to mers-cov severity compared to h1n1 if this relationship is causal however the substantial proportion of diabetes in each of the two infections suggests that introducing effective strategies for diabetes prevention may reduce the severity of a significant number of sari conditions specific systematic vaccination intervention strategies against sari diseases should be also considered for patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular conditions82 this should be viewed as a key public health strategy in preventing sari-associated morbidity and mortality83 during the 195758 pandemic and in response to substantial morbidity and mortality the us surgeon general recommended annual influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic debilitating disease people aged 65 years and pregnant women84 for these high-risk groups the first recommendation of national universal seasonal influenza vaccination was established in 2010 by the advisory committee on immunization practices acip85 recently influenza vaccination was demonstrated to be associated with preventing allcause hospitalization in infected subjects86 however despite numerous recommendations from several public health organizations across the world eg cdc who etc to administer sari vaccines eg influenza annually to diabetic patients vaccination rate in this vulnerable sub-population remains low87-89 the current level of vaccination falls far short of the 2010 national health objectives call for a 90 rate to all elderly people 65 years of age and 60 for younger people who have risk factors eg diabetes88 the prevalence of chronic diseases is rising in middle- and low-income countries as populations age and lifestyles and diets change further studies are being undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of other comorbidities in h1n1 and mers-cov subsequent introduction of effective public health vaccination intervention approaches and strategies is necessary to improve the protection against sari in subjects with chronic disorders such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular conditionsto the editor there is a bidirectional relationship between covid-19 and diabetes on the one hand diabetes is associated with an increased risk of severe covid-19 on the other hand new-onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of preexisting diabetes including diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolarity for which exceptionally high doses of insulin are warranted have been observed in patients with covid-191-3 these manifestations of diabetes pose challenges in clinical management and suggest a complex pathophysiology of covid-19related diabetessevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which are expressed in key metabolic organs and tissues including pancreatic beta cells adipose tissue the small intestine and the kidneys4 thus it is plausible that sars-cov-2 may cause pleiotropic alterations of glucose metabolism that could complicate the pathophysiology of preexisting diabetes or lead to new mechanisms of diseasethere are also several precedents for a viral cause of ketosis-prone diabetes including other coronaviruses that bind to ace2 receptors5 greater incidences of fasting glycemia and acute-onset diabetes have been reported among patients with sars coronavirus 1 pneumonia than among those with non-sars pneumonia5in the aggregate these observations provide support for the hypothesis of a potential diabetogenic effect of covid-19 beyond the well-recognized stress response associated with severe illness however whether the alterations of glucose metabolism that occur with a sudden onset in severe covid-19 persist or remit when the infection resolves is unclear how frequent is the phenomenon of new-onset diabetes and is it classic type 1 or type 2 diabetes or a new type of diabetes do these patients remain at higher risk for diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with preexisting diabetes does covid-19 change the underlying pathophysiology and the natural history of the disease answering these questions in order to inform the immediate clinical care follow-up and monitoring of affected patients is a priorityto address these issues an international group of leading diabetes researchers participating in the covidiab project have established a global registry of patients with covid-19related diabetes covidiabe-dendritecom the goal of the registry is to establish the extent and phenotype of new-onset diabetes that is defined by hyperglycemia confirmed covid-19 a negative history of diabetes and a history of a normal glycated hemoglobin level the registry which will be expanded to include patients with preexisting diabetes who present with severe acute metabolic disturbance may also be used to investigate the epidemiologic features and pathogenesis of covid-19related diabetes and to gain clues regarding appropriate care for patients during and after the course of covid-19 given the very short history of human infection with sars-cov-2 an understanding of how covid-19related diabetes develops the natural history of this disease and appropriate management will be helpful the study of covid-19related diabetes may also uncover novel mechanisms of diseaseon march 11th 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was designated as a global pandemic by the world health organization who as of 28th may 5716271 confirmed cases have been reported with 356124 deaths globally from 188 countries 1 in a matter of months this has escalated into an unprecedented public health as well as an economic crisis several studies have confirmed that patients with covid-19 show distinctive and relatively significant comorbidities of diabetes obesity and cardiovascular disease cvd 212 furthermore covid-19 patients with diabetes obesity and cvd conditions are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality 6 7 13 conversely patients with diabetes cvd and obesity are also at a higher risk of contracting covid-19 infection 6 7 14 broadly speaking cvd diabetes and obesity are associated with poor clinical outcomes 15 16 therefore in the milieu of covid-19 public health systems carers and healthcare providers must take appropriate measures to mitigate the infection risks in this population and consider health system reorganization and adoption of technologies to sustain ongoing management 1719 the frontline healthcare workers triaging and managing covid-19 patients should consider various risks and their compounding effects on the prognoses of patients with cvd diabetes andor obesityindependent of other medical problems such as cvd patients with diabetes are at elevated risk for infection from covid-19 by 2-to-3 fold 13 this may be attributed to the reduced functioning of the immune system caused by high blood glucose levels 13 moreover diabetes is often accompanied by cvd obesity and old age all of which are known to increase the risk of infection 14 outcomes of infection by covid-19 are also poor in this population of 72314 patients from the chinese center for disease control and prevention case series case fatality rate cfr was elevated among those with diabetes and cvd 73 and 105 respectively compared to an overall cfr of 23 5 outcomes are worse in people with poorly controlled diabetes and in those with additional chronic medical conditions such as cvd and obesity 7 13a recent meta-analysis of eight studies from china including 46248 infected patients showed the most prevalent comorbidities were high blood pressure 17  7 95 ci 1422 and diabetes 8  6 95 ci 611 followed by cvd 5  4 95 ci 47 6 at this time though the mechanism of these associations remains unclear the potential explanations include cvd being more prevalent in those with advancing age a functionally impaired immune system elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 or a predisposition to covid-19 for those with cvd 6 there is significant overlap in risk factors of cvd and venous thromboembolism vte with cvd risk factors such as older age smoking and adiposity associated with high vte risk 20 a recent chinese study on 1026 covid-19 patients reported that 40 n  407 at high risk of venous thromboembolism and the high-risk patients who didnt receive prophylactic therapy 11 developed venous thromboembolism 21as of 4th april 2020 the intensive care national audit and research centre icnarc in the united kingdom uk received notification of 2621 covid-19 positive cases requiring critical care 22 analysis of this data suggest a significantly greater number of covid-19 positive cases than seasonal non-covid viral pneumonia patients were obese with body mass index bmi 30 kgm2 38 compared to 31 chi-square 282 p  000001 the requirement for ventilatory support was equal between the obese and non-obese patients 76 and 68 of cases respectively p  0077 obesity was associated with higher mortality rates in critical care when compared to normal or underweight covid-19 positive patients 58 compared to 45 chi-square 83 p  0004 these data derive from the icnarc case mix programme database the case mix programme is the national clinical audit of patient outcomes from adult critical care coordinated by the icnarc for more information on the representativeness and quality of these data we encourage readers to contact icnarc 22in the setting of covid-19 specialist cardiologists and endocrinologists are confronted with a number of critical issues on management and treatment of cvd there has been speculation regarding the risk associated with the use of ace inhibitors acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in patients with covid-19 23 24 this is particularly relevant to patients with diabetes and cvd many of whom rely on such pharmacotherapy for the treatment of retinopathy nephropathy and hypertension 14 though the acei and arb are commonly used in the management of cvds hypertension coronary artery disease congestive heart failure and diabetes there are conflicting data from studies 13 15 16 demonstrating an increase or having minimal effect on ace2 levels 2529poor glycaemic index is known to cause immune suppression through impaired neutrophil degranulation deficient complement system and phagocytosis 30 the co-existence of cvd and diabetes is a known risk factor for several serious respiratory viral illnesses such as influenza 31 with poor glycaemic control being correlated with worse prognosis in diabetic patients infected with covid-19 glucose control is key to the prevention of infection and minimizing the severity of and morbidity caused by infection 32 however the swift transition of primary health care provision from in-person to teleconsultations has led to many patients being unable to access services for regular check-ups presumably due to lack of literacy and access to appropriate technology moreover an increasing number of physicians have reported a sudden decrease in the incidence of myocardial infarction stroke and other acute conditions 33 34 given that the prevalence of these conditions would be invariably the same if not elevated in these circumstances this indicates a problematic decline in the number of patients presenting to hospital with these critical conditions likewise there are increasing concerns related to the postponement of elective cardiac and vascular surgeries with pressure building on the available beds it is imminent that only a select group of patients with clinical indication in which surgery cannot be postponed will receive the therapy 35 furthermore impact of postponement on those who will eventually receive prolonged and delayed surgery vis a vis their long-term morbidity is not known in patients with diabetes cvd or obesity physical exercise is critical to improving patient outcomes 36 with the implementation of self-isolation however the ability and motivation to engage in physical exercise are greatly diminishedhealthcare workers responsible for the care of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disorders infected with covid-19 face threats to their own well-being being at risk of exposure to a high viral load 37 time is critical in acute myocardial or cerebral infarction given the reorganization of healthcare services additional pressure on frontline services for covid-19 cases repurposing of other physicians to meet the demand additional resources limitations are being realized across the spectrum in delivering time-critical reperfusion therapy 34 it is more likely that reperfusion services will also have time-constrained service hours and due to palpable risks from covid-19 positive patients to healthcare workers delivering reperfusion therapy there will be significant negative impact and delays in reperfusion therapy all patients with acute neurocardiovascular events including acute myocardial infarction ami and acute ischemic stroke ais may be recommended to follow the overarching covid-19 protocol to screen for any positive cases in order to minimize the risk to healthcare workers 34refugees undocumented immigrants and members of aboriginal communities also have limited provisions of access and medical relief in pandemic situations due to structural factors and poor socioeconomic conditions that put them at compounded risk due to cardiovascular and diabetes comorbiditiesprofessional societies such as the american association of clinical endocrinologists 38 and european society of endocrinology 39 are in agreement on the need for people with diabetes to prevent and prepare for the spread of covid-19 by taking the regular precautions such as staying home as much as possible and washing hands regularly the guidelines also advise people to continue taking their medication in order to maintain glucose control and to stock up on an additional 30-day supply of medication and supplies for monitoring blood glucose levels at home however there are no specific guidelines targeted at individuals with multiple comorbidities such as obesity and cvd as per the guidance given by the international diabetes federation in the context of covid-19 pandemic people with diabetes are among those high risk categories that can have serious illness just like the flu if they get the virus and it is best not to rush to the hospital to avoid transmitting the virus to others and to allow priority arrangements to be made by medical personnel if needed instead of having to wait in line 40 the international society for pediatric and adolescent diabetes ispad has updated its guidelines recently on 19 march 2020 amidst the recent covid-19 pandemic 41nhs clinical guidelines for the management of diabetic patients in covid-19 recommend expedition of treatment and discharge of inpatients and the use of virtual clinics and teleconsultations in primary and secondary care settings 42 however guidelines fail to address the need for extra measures to be taken for care of patients with poor access and literacy with regards to technology moreover elderly patients and those with chronic disability living in nursing homes or aged care facilities are at heightened risk of infection these patients often have a high prevalence of comorbid cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors which makes them vulnerable during a pandemic such as covid-19 increasing reports of acts of microaggression xenophobia and discrimination are surfacing since the inception of this pandemic this is particularly relevant to specific populations such as south-asians who have high rates of diabetes 43current approaches to the management of this population aim to continue care of patients during covid-19 while minimizing the risk of transmission to both healthcare workers and patients the current protocol at academic medical centers in china for acute myocardial infarction involves compulsory screening for fever and respiratory symptoms and any patients with stemi that have suspected or confirmed infection are treated with emergency intravenous thrombolysis in the absence of contraindications 44 for cardiologists in the operating theater strict guidelines regarding hand hygiene and personal protective equipment ppe are followed and the number of people in operating theater is minimized 44 the american college of cardiology urges the implementation of telehealth in all cardiology clinics 45 other societies including european society of cardiology british cardiovascular society cardiac society of australian and new zealand csanz high blood pressure research council of australia hbprca australian national heart foundation nhf and australian and new zealand society of cardiac and thoracic surgeons anzscts also recommend use of telehealth services 1719with regard to the use of acei and arbs several societies have highlighted that due to the limited nature of the evidence on this matter it is advisable that ongoing management with such medication may continue in patients with diabetes and hypertension unless otherwise clinically contra-indicated as per the case profile 4648 ongoing studies will bring clarity on the use of acei and arbs in covid-19 patients with diabetes and hypertension a recent study reported a higher prevalence of cvd and more than 7 of patients suffer myocardial injury from the infection 22 of the critically ill 49 though ace2 serves as the main gateway for infection the role of acei or arbs requires further investigation myocardial injury is present in more than a quarter of critical cases and presents in two patterns acute myocardial injury and dysfunction on presentation and myocardial injury that develops as the severity of illness intensifies 4952 the continuation of clinically indicated acei and arb medications is recommended based on the available evidence at this time though there are a number of promising treatments under investigation but none with proven clinical efficacy to date covid-19 is proved to pose a challenge for heart transplantation impacting donor selection immunosuppression and post-transplant management 52growing evidence suggests that covid-19 is burdened by a higher risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmic events especially in group of patients with diabetes andor obesity with important implications for survival 53 these life-threatening arrhythmias are also related to inflammation that can increase the duration of ventricular repolarization qtc interval 54 a particular attention to inflammation and arrhythmias is important in these patients that are frequently affected by qtc prolongation 55 56 therefore key electrocardiogram ecg parameters such as qtc interval should be monitored in this subgroup of patients surveillance of qtc could potentially reduce the number of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths 57 this is particularly relevant as off-label agents such as hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and lopinavirritonavir are being increasingly used in post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment of covid-19 patients 57 58 these drugs are proven to increase the risk of qtc interval prolongation ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death 58patients with diabetes with multiple comorbidities such as obesity and cvd should take extra precaution for the prevention of possible infection risk due to covid-19 they are recommended to be in virtual contact with their primary health carers and to maintain glycaemic control with diligence to ensure the maintenance of adequate glucose control in such exceptional circumstances it is recommended that primary health care physicians take additional interestresponsibility to reach out to patients who have not presented for regular check-ups the main recommendations for pediatric and adolescents with diabetes and cvd are summarized table 1 due to the alarming decline in patients presenting with emergent conditions to hospitals and outpatient clinics without any indications of a fall in prevalence of these conditions we would request public health professions to take extra measures in reaching out to patients regarding the safety of coming to hospitals and the medical need to do so and benefit of getting timely acute reperfusion therapy in eligible patients given the aggravated risks we propose a novel triage and management protocol that takes into account risks with cvd and diabetes figure 1virtual delivery of group exercise classes could be organized for patients with diabetes cvd or obesity who are currently restricted by social isolation cross-department and peer-to-peer inter-specialty professional collaboration and communication are recommended to adapt existing pandemic preparedness and response strategies to manage patients with neuro cardiovascular emergencies special protection must be observed during interventions that produce aerosol cardiopulmonary resuscitation this may lower the risk of infection to healthcare workers and patients cardiovascular experts may brace themselves for deployments in different settings for limited extended or repurposed causes the mobility of staff between covid-19 treatment units and other patient facing consultation should be limited to avoid opportunities for nosocomial transmission covid-19 and patients with cvd diabetes or obesity impact each other in compounding and negative dimensions these patients are at increased risk of covid-19 related hospitalization morbidity and death and those with covid-19 also show propensity to increasing and emergent acute cardiovascular events it is important to identify covid-19 patients who are at high risk of vte so that appropriate prophylaxis treatment could be initiated 22 59 anticoagulation should be considered for vte prophylaxis given the high risk of bleeding in covid-19 patients with high vte risk considerations should include adjustments in anticoagulant dose and duration as well as use of mechanical compressions 22obesity is associated with severe covid-19 712 22 60 moreover obesity or higher bmi is known to be associated with a higher risk of cvd diabetes and hypertensionwhich are independent predictors of poor outcomes in covid-19 50 60 the analyses of icnarc data suggest that bmi30 kgm2 should be used as a prognostic indicator of mortality in critical care settings due to covid-19 22 another recent study found a significant association of the prevalence of obesity defined by bmi30 kgm2 with severe covid-19 7 we recommend that clinicians should consider bmi30 while estimating risks and stratifying patients for early and ongoing intervention center for disease control and prevention cdc in the united states also list obesity although with a relatively higher bmi cut-off of 40 kgm2 as an independent risk factor of severe illness in covid-19 61 there are concerns this bmi cut-off 40 kgm2 might mislead or compromise the safety of obese people at lower bmis 60 the current consortium recommends bmi cut-off of 30 kgm2 in identifying patients with adverse covid-19 prognosis surveillance of ecg parameters is recommended to potentially reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death in covid-19 positive patients especially those with history of diabetes andor obesity andor those on post-exposure prophylactic treatment 5358in addition to clinical management public health interventions must be adhered to such as masks preferably n95 washing hands social distancing a new england journal of medicine study showed efficacy of face masks in preventing further transmission of coronavirus from symptomatic individuals 62 it is evident from the guidance currently issued between world health organization who the cdc in united states the canadian standards association and canadian federal guidance canada and the uk that differences exist in advice for healthcare workers to use respirators as opposed to surgical face masks 6365 the uk initially advocated covid-19 is classified as an airborne high consequence infectious disease in the uk and instructed ensure that staff who are assessing or caring for suspected covid-19 cases are familiar with an ffp3 respirator conforming to en149 a protection level higher than n95 and that fit testing has been undertaken before using this equipment 65 the current uk position aligns with who guidance although recommending risk assessment by the individual healthcare worker within the guidance framework the situation for low- and middle-income countries is made more difficult by a lack of resources and the uncertain availability of respiratory and ppe often intended as single use onlyrecently the cdc recommended wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain eg grocery stores and pharmacies especially in areas of significant community-based transmission 66 coronavirus like influenza and rhinovirus can possibly spread through short range aerosol transmission in exhaled breath therefore this study reinforces the need for individual and public health strategies and the adoption of using face masks as a preventive intervention the american academy of ophthalmology aao recommends contact lens wearers to switch to wearing glasses for a while to limit the risk of covid-19 infection 67pandemics like covid-19 sars and spanish flu invoke irrational and heightened fear which could be linked to incidents of xenophobia and discrimination 68 a public health crisis of this scale can quickly mutate into a social and political crisis therefore it is warranted that the political and health systems leadership must continue transparent open and respectful communication with all communities with special consideration for communities from marginalized and vulnerable backgrounds as they tend to have a disproportionately poor cardiovascular and metabolic profile 68 also this subgroup of patients often have relatively poor access to health services and compromised provision of medical supplies which is exacerbated in a public health crisis situation more so for a sustained period as is the case with pandemics such as covid-19 with an estimated mortality of 34 however the recent evidence suggests the rates are still evolving 69 70patients with comorbid cvd diabetes and obesity are potentially vulnerable in a pandemic 6870 it must be considered that a significant number of healthcare workers will have these same and other vulnerabilities due to pre-existing health conditions therefore institutional policies should provide for redeployment away from covid-19 patient direct contact or furlough some jurisdictions have developed national policy or workplace sector guidance in others there is likely a duty of care in law healthcare providers health systems and political leadership must account for the heterogeneity compounded infection and fatality risks long-term complications and special considerations for ongoing management as well as the socio-economic factors that may interfere with the health and well-being of patients with cvd diabetes andor obesity technological innovation such as telemedicine along with public health strategies may mitigate some of these risksthe original contributions presented in the study are included in the

to human where dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for this virus or by a human to the human transmission which requires close contact cotten et al 2013 de groot et al 2013 many studies suggested that mers-cov has a male predominance prevalence with a median age of 40 years at illness onset aleanizy et al 2017 chan et al 2015 chen et al 2017 data showed that underlying immunodeficiency or immunosuppressant medications and therapies or diabetes mellitus are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality aleanizy et al 2017 chen et al 2017up to mid-2018 2229 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers-cov infection were reported to the world health organization who from 27 countries middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov who mers global summary

america and asia middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov who mers global summary and assessment of risk global summary 2018 this has directed the development of stringent screening criteria that has been implemented in different health care systems in saudi arabia including ministry of health hospitals a suspected case which defined as an instance of admission to a health care facility with any clinical symptoms that suggest infection or a history of contact with established cases will trigger a laboratory mers-cov testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for mers-cov in swab samples collected at admission aleanizy et al 2017although many studies have suggested the prognosis of confirmed mers-cov and the contribution of underlying comorbidities on the severity of the disease yet no studies have highlighted the characteristics of those who tested positive with rt-pcr test among suspected cases especially the contribution of medications thus it is the intent of this paper is to identify factors associated with the mers-cov confirmation among suspected cases and impact on medications history on virus transmissionsubjects with suspected mers-cov infection and confirmed cases of mers-cov were included in the final analysis suspected cases were identified from medical record at university hospital and confirmed cases were identified from both university hospital and ministray of health data it covers the patient admitted during the period from september 2013 to december 2018 suspect cases were defined as any incidence of hospitalization with two or more of the following clinical symptoms temperature 38 c signs of upper respiratory infection cough shortness of breath sore throat etc runny nose or low level of consciousness confirmed cases were defined as a suspected case with a laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection on the basis of positive real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr results for mers-cov in swab samples subjects were excluded if they were any missing data that prevent the final analysisafter the study had been approved by the institution review board committee we collected the subjects data on both suspected cases and confirmed cases demographic data include age and gender were collected we have also collected data on existing comorbidities including diabetes chronic heart disease defined as ischemic heart disease myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome medications at the point of screening were collected including metformin sulfonylureas dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 inhibitors angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors beta blockers and diureticsdescriptive statistics were used to report the demographic data percentages and frequencies were used to summarize the categorical variables while means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables chi-square or fishers exact test as required and two-sample t-tests were used to summarize the relationships between demographic variables and the outcome of the serological test for categorical and continuous data respectively a logistic regression model was used to assess the risk of mers-cov infection among the suspected cases a value of p  005 was considered statistically significant data were entered and analyzed using ibm spss for windows version 22 ibm corp armonk ny usaa total of 16189 suspected cases were included in the study of which 348 215 had a confirmed laboratory infection with another tested negative on the rt-pcr the mean age for the suspected cases was 40 year of age and the mean age for confirmed cases was 52 year of age the majority of the confirmed cases were male 62 more comorbidities are common among the confirmed group including hypertension and diabetes compared to the suspected cases for more sample characteristics see table 1of the 16189 suspected cases complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with mers-cov infection mers-cov infection was associated with age adjusted odds ratio aor  106 95 ci 1021098 p-value  0004 male gender aor  1617 95 ci 1365177 p-value  0001 and diabetes aor  168 95 ci 13461848 p-value  0002 there was no significant association with the other comorbidities medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection table 2in this study we evaluated the characteristics of confirmed mers infection as reported on smaller studies age male sex and comorbidities are likely to be associated with the infection aleanizy et al 2017 chen et al 2017 guery et al 2013 other variables are less likely to suggest mers infection in term of medication history of the analyzed sample we found no statical differences that suggest increase or decrease the likelihood of the mers infection however all subjects on received dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 inhibitors tested negative which may suggest an underlying mechanism that prevents the transmission of the virus other medications include metformin angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors nor beta blockers are associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the mesra infectionlike other studies that suggested that mers infection is predominance in male we found a statistical association that confirmed this aleanizy et al 2017 chen et al 2017 guery et al 2013 although our study has a large female representation in our sample and which can be due to the likelihood of the sharp increase in health care workers- which likely to be female screening upon exposure to a patient with a possible history of mers infection the other reason is many health care institutions became very strict with screening and testing any suspected cases to prevent mers infection outbreaks which increase the female detection our study suggests that gender difference is associated with an increase in the likelihood of mers infection also our study suggests diabetic patient are more likely to have a confirmed mers infection compared to nondiabetic patients which have been also reported previously in the literature zumla et al 2015one of the unique sides of our study is to look at the impact of medications on mers infection to our knowledge this is the first study to look at the association of patients medication history and the risk of infection we found that many medications include those for chronic diseases are not associated with the increase or decrease the likelihood of mers infection although many diabetic patients were on metformin our analysis shows that it has no effect on mers infection similarly sulfonylureas were not associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the infection of the diabetic medication patient on ddp-4 inhibitors was less likely to have mers infection the entry receptor for mers-cov was identified as a dipeptidyl peptidase receptor ddp-4 is expressed on the surface of human airway and the blockage of this enzyme may interfere with the virus transmissionin a similar study looked at the demographics of patients with mers infection many studies suggested that the infection is more common in patients with comorbidities primarily diabetes and chronic kidney diseases moreover the severity of the infection and the increased risk of mortality is likely with older patients and patients with diabetes and chronic kidney diseases these findings suggest the benefit of screening suspected infection and may suggest future preventive therapythe limitations of this study include the following first there were some missing data on some demographics data which limit the analysis to draw a better understanding of the infection second this was a retrospective analysis which has an inherited flow by its nature finally the outcome of infection and the severity of disease were not reported in the studymers-cov infection is more common in male advanced age and diabetes no medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection except for the dpp-4 inhibitors that have shown a less likely to have mers infection this is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient populationthe authors declare no potential conflicts of interest withrespect to the research authorship and publication of this articlegestational diabetes mellitus gdm is defined as hyperglycemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy at severity less than those that occur in overt diabetes 12 gdm is a high-risk condition with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes 34 identification and treatment of gdm improve pregnancy outcomes thus requiring earlier therapeutic intervention 5different approaches for the screening of gestational diabetes mellitus have a significant impact on the management of gestational diabetes and its future complications 6 however there are still many controversies surrounding gdm diagnosis and management 7first prenatal visit is considered the best time to screen for gestational diabetes by the majority of health organizations 18 the aims of early screening are identifying women with overt diabetes and are mainly to diagnose women at low or high risk for gestational diabetes 9 to obtain such diagnosis fasting plasma glucose fpg random plasma glucose rpg and glucose glycosylated hemoglobin a1c hba1c are the most commonly used approachesa 75 grams 2 h ogtt at 2428 weeks of gestation is recommended by iadpsg as the standard test for diagnosis of gdm 10 early postpartum follow-up of women with a history of gdm provides an opportunity to assess the health status of both the mothers and their offspring 11 international guidelines recommend early screening of glucose status for prevention of diabetes at 412 weeks postpartum using the 75 g 2 h ogtt and after that 1213lifestyle changes as an essential component of the management of gestational diabetes mellitus are recommended in many national clinical practice guidelines interventions including advice on healthy eating increase physical activity selfmonitoring of blood sugar and training on the use of glucose meter and interpreting glucose readings if insulin should be added may play essential roles in promoting the health of women with gestational diabetes and their children 14covid-19 pandemic impaired routine prenatal care disrupted traditionally face-to-face communication with patients and reduced access to laboratory testing 15 moreover patient refusal of a long time waiting for the standard test due to the fear of illness shows the necessity of revision in clinical guidelines during the current epidemic we need to compare the benefits of standard routine care and testing with the risks of exposure to novel coronaviruswe performed a narrative review using keywords such as covid-19 and gestational diabetes guideline novel coronavirus gestational diabetes clinical practices or recommendationat first we searched multiple databases from inception till may 2020 for the documents related to gestational diabetes screening or management including the guidelines of the national institute for health and clinical excellence nice database the national guidelines of clearinghouse ngc for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines of the united states the medline and embase database and guidelines international networks library then gray literature was conducted for all professional societies and organizations in the field of diabetes and obstetrics which have had a standard guideline before the covid-19 crisis 16 if the list of guidelines were not available on their website we sent an email to request for any updated guidelinesix national guidelines from canada the united kingdom australia new zealand and australia health agencies were identified one of the guideline provided by the australasian diabetes in pregnancy society adips the australian diabetes society ads the australian diabetes educators association adea and diabetes australia da was a duplicate version of the queensland guideline so we focused on original recommendation published by queensland clinical guidelines searches were limited to guidelines in the english languagefor pregnant women with no pre-existing diabetes hba1c andor fbg or non-fasting random plasma glucose test was recommended early testing for gdm should be done solely for women who are at higher risk of overt diabetes with one or more risk factors for gdm cutoff thresholds for fbg hba1c random plasma glucose were differentduring covid-19 the canadian guideline recommend no changes to screen for overt diabetes early in pregnancy the latest guideline from canada was released in 2018 17 which indicates early testing should be done only in women who are at risk of overt diabetes hba1c or a fasting plasma glucose is recommended if an a1c is unreliable women with negative testing should be re-screened at 2428 weeks gestationaustralasian diabetes in pregnancy society adips and the australian diabetes society ads in the last updated guideline april 24 2020 outlined a three-phase system for gdm testing during the pandemic based on contagion risk of each local and state government the alternative method for first trimester testing for gdm during the amber  red status risk of contagion is moderate to high are random blood glucose rbg and hba1c the advised cutoff point for the diagnosis of gdm were hba1c  59 or random blood glucose rbg 90 mmollroyal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynecologist ranzcog guideline emphasized on the necessity of early pregnancy screening merely in high-risk pregnant women in the first trimester during antenatal serology testing hba1c was the recommended test by this guideline and a cutoff of 59 was considered for gdm diagnosisqueensland clinical guideline-recommended hba1c 41 mmolmol or more 59 for gdm diagnosis in pregnant women with a risk factor and ignored ogtt testing in the first trimester temporarilyin the united kingdon according to the royal college of obstetrics

managed as gdm hba1c and fasting or rbg should be repeated for other high-risk pregnant women at 28 weeks of gestationa strong agreement was observed in updated guidelines about 2-h ogtt as the most important screening test for gdm diagnosis in 2428 weeks of gestation all guidelines were in agreement to not perform testing during the pandemicfbg rpg and a1c have commonly selected alternatives based on canadas clinical guideline women with an a1c of 57 or random plasma glucose of 111 mmoll are identified as having gdmranzcog guideline considered fbg at 2428 weeks 51 mmoll as diagnostic of gdm while adips and ads recommended the performance of an fbg at 2428 weeks 51 mmoll and further ogtt for women with an fbg between 47 and 50 mmoll based on this guideline if the risk of contagion is high an fbg alone may be enoughbased on queensland clinical guidelines at 2428 weeks gestation irrespective of covid-19 status ogtt is required if fbg is between 47 and 50 mmol fbg 51 mmoll or higher does not require ogtt and should be considered as gdmwomen with hba1c  39 mmolmol or fbg 53 mmoll or random plasma glucose  nine mmoll will be diagnosed as having gdm based on united kingdom guidelines furthermore glycosuria suspicion of diabetes due to a clinical symptom pregnancy with polyhydramnios or large for gestational age should be screened for gdm regardless of the months of pregnancydeferred or delay of postpartum screening in women with gdm in recent pregnancy was recommended by all of the available national guidelines during the pandemic post partum screening is postponed to 36 months after delivery by uk hba1c only while the queensland clinical guideline australia recommended delaying the postpartum ogtt for 612 months postpartum ogtt should be performed before their child turns 12 months old or before next pregnancy continued self-monitoring if mother has greater risk for type 2 diabetes and an hba1c test at 46 months postpartum may also be appropriate based on this guidelinevirtual management of gestational diabetes using telehealth advised by published national guidelines during covid-19 outbreakscanadian guideline suggested that video or phone call reduces face-to-face communication in initial and follow-up visits other methods of communication are as follows sharing critical clinical data including blood pressure and weight obtained from in-person visits between obstetricians and diabetes team virtual visits by asking individuals to send the result of blood glucose testing via email use of video conference for virtual classes and teaching insulin injectionsranzcog recommends the following telehealth and phone consultation with obstetricians and gynecologists temporary allocation of medicare benefits schedule a listing of the medicare services subsidized by the australian government self-blood glucose monitoring self-insulin monitoring virtual consultation for dietary and exercise plans delaying of gdm testing for women with positive covid-19 test until after isolation performing an ultrasound screening at 36 weeks for suspected macrosomia or fetal growth restriction casesin the united kingdom the health authorities recommendations to patients are inclusive of 1 educational video calls with the diabetes midwifenurse to ensure safe self-monitoring with a glucose meter and proper dieting 2 no hospital visits or ultrasound scans 3 contacting the diabetic health team if blood glucose is higher than the target levelmoreover the uk health authorities emphasize on training community midwives to check the mothers blood glucose readings remotely furthermore women with gdm who are taking metformin and or insulin require an obstetric evaluation at 2832 weeks gestation in such cases when the in-person visit is necessary the appointment shall include an opportunity for an ultrasound appointment planning for birth is recommended at 36 weeks of gestation when feasible almost all of these guidelines emphasize the importance of making a decision based on contamination risk the ability of local laboratories to arrange for social distancing and available resources for remote management they also remind us that temporary alternatives do not replace the standard of carea review of published guidelines up to may 2020 showed a consensus on three important issues in screening and management of gestational diabetes during the covid-19 crisis first replace oggt with other glucose tests fbg hba1c rpg for gdm screening at 2428 weeks of gestation second defer 412 weeks postpartum screening test until the end of covid-19 crisis or delay up to 612 months after birth and third use telemedicine and telecare where it is feasiblethe rationales for the suggestion of these temporary measures were shortening the screening test process to reduce risk of exposure to covid-19 in laboratories reducing the burden on pathology centers diabetes care providers and obstetrics team minimizing the number of visits and duration of stay in the hospital for pregnant women and reducing in-person visit by replacing such visits with remote communication with patientsalthough poor specificity of fbg test makes it an inappropriate test for screening in the first trimester 19furthermore there is conflicting evidence about the accuracy of the rpg 20the use of 75g 2-h ogtt is considered as the golden-standard test for the diagnosis of gdm in 2428 weeks of gestation but updated guidelines preferred screening tests fbg hba1c rpg with more flexibility and quick turn around that would be feasible and easily available would not require fasting and would be conducted with minimal laboratory facilities table 1poor specificity and high false-positive of fbg restrict its efficiency for gdm screening however it can be useful for decision making about the need for the oggt test and can reduce the number of required ogtts about half 21 also hba1c is not recommended for screening of gdm by international guidelines in 2428 weeks of pregnancy and is not a useful alternative to an ogtt in pregnant women 22furthermore there is a conflicting evidence about the accuracy of the rpg there are limited pieces of evidence on the accuracy of rpg being an excellent predecessor for gdm based on a systematic review a single random glucose measurement is inadequate to screen for gdm 23performance of an ogtt is also a standard test for postpartum diabetes screening in women with gdm in recent pregnancy however screening for postpartum diabetes in patients with gdm is a challenge worldwide 24 25 26 currently under covid-19 epidemic we require to compare the benefits of the performance of 412 weeks postpartum screening tests as a standard routine test versus deferral of this test interestingly there were differences between types of tests and cutoff of values for gdm diagnosis for instance canadas guideline recommends that women with an hba1c of 57 or rbg of 111 mmoll be identified with gdm in 2428 weeks of gestation while united kingdom guideline considers the following thresholds hba1c 57 rbg 9o mmoll or fpg 53 mmoll 27 but the value of these indexes for gdm screening remains uncertain 28challenges faced with new temporary recommendations are alternative screening strategies can identify only the women with the highest risk and will miss many women with lower glucose intolerance this may affect the short- and long-term health status of mothers and their children furthermore new approaches and recommendations during the covid-19 epidemic are not evidence-based hence can cause adverse health impacts moreover the implantation of new strategies in the management of gdm may not be suitable for women living in poor-nations with inadequate-resources or roadblocks in the application of telemedicine 1529 it should be outlined based on available resourcesone of the limitations of our review was restricted sources as we could not find any guidelines for asian countries with a high incidence of the corvid-19 outbreak and developing countries with low-income another limitation was limiting our search to the english language despite this limitation it is the first narrative review that collectively provides information challenges and limitations of clinical guidelines for screening and management of gdm during this emergency crisis appropriate and universal gdm testing and management protocol should be provided base on the risk of exposure to the viral epidemic and available resources it seems in spite of many

65 respectively 1 obesity is another comorbidity raising the risk of complications in covid-19 infection the immune system acts upon inflammation that occurs in adipose tissue due to obesity increasing vulnerability to infections 2 increased circulating levels of many cytokines and proteins released by adipocytes are associated with inflammation in obese individuals 3 inflammation from adipose tissue generates chronic and systemic metabolic alterations leading to dyslipidemia hypertension cvd and diabetes thus increasing the risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-22 it is thought that sars-cov-2 as sars-cov and mers-cov suppress anti-viral type ifn- responses in the early stage of infection leading to an uncontrolled viral replication this mechanism later leads to an influx of neutrophils and monocytesmacrophages resulting in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage lung tissue ie pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome specific th1th17 cells may be activated and contribute to increased inflammation these facts and the higher mortality by covid-19 observed in those with underlying diseases indicates that immune response is a determining factor to covid-19 outcome 4according to phylogenetic analyses sars-cov-2 is related to other existing respiratory infections such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov 5 sars-cov infection accounted for 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries 6 meanwhile mers-cov infection was identified in 27 countries with 2449 confirmed cases and 845 deaths 7 as is being observed in covid-19 mers-cov infection also caused more severe complications in older and immunocompromised patients with a history of diabetes renal failure and lung diseases 8 according to genome sequencing sars-cov-2 is about 89 identical to bat sars-like-covzxc21 82 identical to human sars-cov and about 50 to mers-cov 59 several phylogenetic analyses suggests the bat as most probable animal reservoir for sars-cov-2 and as both sars-cov and mers-cov were transmitted from bats to palm civets or dromedary camels and then to humans it is possible though that another animal plays the role of intermediate host between bat and human in sars-cov-2 infection 10 these viruses have a structural protein the spike glycoprotein s that is responsible for its binding to host cells 11 according to hoffman 12 protein s is primed by human serine protease tmprss2 and recognized by the cell receptor a recent study described by liu 11 shows that sars-cov entering in the respiratory tract depends on a receptor-binding domain rbd to bind to the host and protein s has two trimers that bind to the heterodimer of angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 a synthetic sars-cov-2 rbd analysis indicated that the virus enters into the host cell through ace2 binding however mers-cov binds specifically to another receptor dipeptidil peptidase 4 dpp4 1113 therefore since sars-cov-2 is analogous to sars-cov it is suggested that both use ace2 as the main mechanism for cell entrythe pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is not yet well understood it is known to cause an acute lung injury and that this condition resembles sars-cov which results in aggressive inflammation initiated by viral replication 14 in this review we tried to discuss and report possible mechanisms of inflammatory responses mediated by sars-cov-2 in individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases and to speculate possible therapeutic target that can be applied to obtain a better immune response reduce pro-inflammatory profile and consequently reduce critical levels of the diseasewe systematically searched the pubmed database up until april 23 2020 using the keywords covid-19 sars-cov-2 treatment of coronavirus and following terms diabetes mellitus obesity hypertension arterial ace-inhibitors cytokine storms immune response and vitamin d our database research results were accessed and relevant cross references were made to the proposed mini reviewthe immune system plays an important role in inflammation that occurs in adipose tissue due to obesity which increases vulnerability to infections inflammation in adipose tissue generates metabolic alterations that can cause comorbidities such as dyslipidemia hypertension cardiovascular diseases and diabetes thus increasing the risk of infection by sars-cov-22the overexpression of inflammatory adipokines from visceral fat deposits can affect the immune response impair chemotaxis and alter the differentiation of macrophages the imbalance between the secretion of anti- and pro-inflammatory adipokines from thoracic visceral fat deposits such as the epicardium and mediastinal may also play a role in the cytokine storm described in patients with severe sars-cov-2 a study demonstrated the active role of macrophages in morbid obesity and the relationship they have with inflammatory processes concluding that the disease of chronic inflammation initiated in adipose tissue is a consequence of insulin resistance 20hyperleptinemia tissue dysfunction low antioxidant defenses chronic inflammation and the generation of postprandial ros are factors involved in the development of obesity in which oxidative stress participates 21 as the increase in oxidative stress in accumulated fat is at least in part the underlying cause of adipocytokine dysregulation and the development of the metabolic syndrome 22 it is known that obesity induces oxidative stress through various mechanisms such as chronic inflammation endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction 23 interestingly it was reported that adiponectin predicted mortality in critically ill patients after admission to the intensive care unit icu the innate inflammatory response of visceral fat deposits can cause a positive regulation and greater release of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 24in addition adipose tissue serves as a reservoir for several viruses such as influenza a hiv and cytomegalovirus and may also be infected by the covid-19 virus 2 for being an important source of il-6 and its receptor il-6r therefore adipose tissue can serve as a reservoir for the activation of il-6 and cascade signaling of viral infection the spread of viruses from organs affected by adjacent adipose tissue can take days with prolonged viral shedding also contributing to the delay of the cytokine storm and consequent tissue damage in patients with covid-19 2526diabetes mellitus dm is a major risk factor for severity and mortality in individuals infected by sars-cov-2 similar risk evidence among people with diabetes has been reported for the previous two cov infections sars in 2002 mers in 2012 27 studies have associated diabetes with greater weight loss and increased lung inflammation with macrophage infiltrates similar to those observed in the disease 27 the risk of infections in patients with diabetes can be reduced although it cannot be completely eliminated by good glycemic control for all people with diabetes over 2 years old pneumococci and annual vaccination against influenza are recommended in addition patients with diabetes have a serious disease when infected with respiratory infections in fact diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza h1n1 in 2009 sars-cov and mers-scov 28 glycemic homeostasis requires close quantitative and temporal regulation of glucose flow through different organs most of the circulating glucose in the body is in a stable configuration similar to the biochemical characteristics of the cell wall from commensal bacteria found in the individual 29 in the immune system host-pathogen and host-host interactions take place through the recognition and binding of oligosaccharides in so-called c type lectin receptors clrs which will induce a specific immune response several c type lectins recognize oligosaccharides rich in sugars such as mannose and fucose which have a similar chemical structure to glucose 30 as sars-cov-2 recognition is through protein s a glycoprotein it may as well increase inflammatory processes 12 in addition the connection of sars-cov-2 with ace2 in people with uncontrolled hyperglycemia may be important in covid-19 pathogenesis possible changes in ace2 glycosylation as well as viral peak protein s glycosylation both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia may alter both virus binding to ace2 and immune response intensity against the virus 31thiazide-type diuretics calcium channel blockers ccb -blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers arb are antihypertensive drugs with distinct targets to lower blood pressure the acei and arb drugs targets the renin angiotensin system ras and are also used in diabetes treatment leading to an increased ace2 expression that has been suggested by fang 32 as risk increaser for severity of covid-19 since sars-cov-2 uses ace2 to enter the cells in contrast the study by meng 33 in a hypertensive chinese population with covid-19 under treatment with aceiarb drugs displayed an attenuated inflammatory response by inhibiting il-6 cytokine levels they achieved a better clinical result higher cd3 and cd8 t cell counts in peripheral blood and lower viral load peak in comparison to other antihypertensive drugs in addition during hospitalization 12 patients from the non-aceiarb group 48 were considered severe and one patient died versus aceiarb group with 4 severe patients 235 and no deaths therefore there is no evidence that increased ace2 expression by these drugs is indeed harmful and further studies are needed to clarify their effects on covid-19 infection also the il-6 controlled levels leading to better clinical results showed that an equilibrated inflammatory response is determining a better outcome for covid-19 diseaseit has been reported that patients with severe symptoms of covid-19 present the cytokine storm cs phenomenon an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines cs can be triggered by infectious diseases rheumatic diseases and tumor immunotherapy and it generally presents as systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure 34 among the consequences of cs on lung viral infections are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis resulting in vascular leakage and alveolar edema ultimately leading to hypoxia impaired t cell response accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages changed tissue homeostasis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the last being a primary cause of death in sars-covmers-cov patients 35 the levels of inflammatory factors were measured in a study reported by huang 36 including 41 covid-19 patients 13 icu and 28 non-icu patients il-1b il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf interferon- ifn interferon--inducible protein ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a tumor necrosis factor tnf vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and others inflammatory factors were increased in both icu and non-icu patients compared to healthy adults icu patients showed higher concentrations of gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf than non-icu patients suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with higher disease severity a retrospective cohort study conducted by zhou 37 reported elevated il-6 blood levels in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course of covid-19 illness other studies also reported il-6 increased levels in patients with severe covid-19 38 39 40 in anhui china a clinical trial chictr2000029765 using the il-6 receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody mab tocilizumab reported improvement of respiratory function and rapid fever control in 21 patients with severe covid-19 all patients recovered and were discharged from hospital including two who were in critical condition 41 this indicates the need of targeting anti-inflammatory strategies to the treatment of covid-19 and demonstrates that a balanced immune host response is crucial to eliminate sars-cov-2 infection successfullygiven the need for a balanced immune response vitamin d stands out its action is mediated by binding its active form 1--dihydroxyvitamin d3 vd3 to its receptor vdr expressed in several immune cells 4243 vd3 has a genomic binding site vdr-gp in which a transcriptional complex is formed modulating the expression of genes such as ace and the vdr itself 42 according to sassi 42 individuals with respiratory infections and sepsis had exacerbated symptoms and reduced vd3 levels when using vd3 as an experimental treatment protocol in patients with respiratory infections it was observed infection reduction and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 and il-6 which are produced by helper th1 cells 42 besides on acting on the immune system this hormone plays an important role in metabolic disorders such as the pathophysiology of diabetes modulating the expression of insulin and reducing systemic inflammation regulating blood pressure by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas and in obesity regulating adipogenesis and the production and release of adipokines and cytokines as vd3 is connected to various metabolic pathways and immune system response it becomes important to identify it as a therapeutic target 43individuals with cardiometabolic diseases are more prone to sars-cov-2 infection due to immune response dysregulation as the inflammatory response does not occur immediately the role of medications generally used by individuals affected with diabetes hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases especially ace inhibitors is debatable since those drugs lead to ace2 receptor overexpression associated to sars-cov-2 cells entry after virus entry into the cell it multiplies until reaches many copies generating a more acute and late inflammatory response thus a storm of cytokines occurs that end up harming healthy cells in order to regulate inflammation and reduce damage to healthy cells vd can modulate a favorable immune response and could hypothetically reduce levels of associated complicationsms thays maria costa de lucena tmcl conceived this mini-review and along with ms ariane fernandes da silva santos afss and ms brenda regina de lima fabrcio brlf carried out all the necessary scientific literature research and wrote the entire body of the text subsequently to msc maria eduarda de albuquerque borborema meab and phd jaqueline de azevdo silva jas discussed the content revised and adjusted the written materialin december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in wuhan hubei china shortly a novel coronavirus was isolated from respiratory tract samples named as sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 the new virus rapidly spread globally resulting in a pandemic sars-cov-2 belongs to betacoronavirus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers viruses responsible for serious outbreaks in china in 20022003 and in the middle east in 2012 respectively 1the disease caused by sars-cov-2 known as covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 ranges from mild acute respiratory illness to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock severe disease mainly occurs in older adults and those with underlying medical comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic lung disease cancer and chronic kidney disease 2in a study with 115 patients diagnosed with sars-cov in hong kong in 2003 the presence of diabetes was independently associated with an increased mortality risk hr 47 95  ci 15143 p  0008 3 similarly a systematic analysis of 637 mers-cov cases identified diabetes as a comorbidity in approximately 50  of patients 4 diabetes was also associated with increased risk of complications during the 2009 pandemic influenza a h1n1 infection 5despite higher transmissibility sars-cov-2 appears to have a lower case fatality rate than sars-cov 95  and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 344  but higher than that of influenza 01  6the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 depends on the size and characteristics of study population early estimates came from china in a multicenter study with 1099 patients hospitalized with covid-19 illness in china the overall prevalence of diabetes was 74  2 in a meta-analysis of 7 studies including 1576 patients from china diabetes was the second most common comorbidity following hypertension and was present in 97  of patients 7 in another meta-analysis of 21 studies mainly from china hypertension and diabetes were the most prevalent comorbidities present in 156  and 77  respectively among 47344 patients with covid-19 8 in a retrospective study of 1591 critically ill patients admitted in icu in the lombardy region of italy hypertension was the most common comorbidity 49  followed by cardiovascular disorders 21  hypercholesterolemia 18  and diabetes 17  9observational studies so far indicate that diabetes is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with covid-19 diabetic patients are at higher risk to develop complications of covid-19 and been admitted to intensive care unit 10 a study evaluating the metabolic cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with covid-19 found that hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were present in 171  164  and 97  respectively among 1527 patients the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes was about 2-fold 3-fold and 2-fold respectively higher in intensive care unit icusevere cases than in non-icusevere counterparts diabetes accounted for 40  of non-icusevere cases and 117  of icusevere cases in this study 11 in a meta-analysis of 1558 covid-19 patients from 6 studies diabetes was an independent risk factor for disease progression or 247 p  0001 along with hypertension or 229 p  0001 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd or 597 p  0001 cardiovascular disease or 293 p  0001 and cerebrovascular disease or389 p  0002 12 diabetes also significantly increased the risk of icu admission or 279 95  ci 185422 p  00001 among 1382 patients with covid-19 13 diabetic patients were at higher mortality risk or 321 95  ci 182564 p  00001 in an analysis of 471 patients 13 in a larger meta-analysis of 6452 patients from 30 studies diabetic patients were at increased risk for death rr 212 p  0001 severe covid-19 rr 245 p  0001 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards rr 464 p  0001 and disease progression rr 331 p  004 14in a study that included 72314 cases of covid-19 from the chinese center for disease control and prevention the overall case-fatality rate cfr was 23  but patients with diabetes had a 3-fold higher mortality rate than those without diabetes 73  vs 23  15 the overall fatality rate of persons with confirmed covid-19 in the italian population was 72  which was substantially higher than in china 23  this difference may be partly explained due to the older age of patients in italy 16in a study that included 5700 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in 12 hospitals in new york city the most common comorbidities were hypertension 566  obesity 417  and diabetes 338  mortality was high 881  for those who required mechanical ventilation among those who died patients with diabetes were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation 558  vs 477  or icu care 576  vs 492  compared with non-diabetics moreover patients with diabetes were more likely to develop acute kidney injury than those without 135  vs 8 among discharged patients 17the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated with the increased frequency and severity of covid-19 in people with diabetes are not yet elucidated there are several hypotheses to explain why covid-19 is more frequent in diabetes and associated with worse outcomesin general diabetes is associated with an increased risk of various infections including viral ones 18 alterations in innate immunity play a major role in increased susceptibility to infections in diabetics while humoral immunity appears relatively unaffected hyperglycemia depresses neutrophil chemotaxis phagocytosis opsonization adherence to vascular endothelium and intracellular bactericidal activity 19 the presence of diabetic complications such as vascular insufficiency and peripheral neuropathy may also predispose to infections 20 moreover poor glycemic control contributes to this increased risk of infections in people with diabetes 21 diabetes and obesity are associated with a low grade subclinical chronic inflammation due to increased secretion of adipose tissue hormones and cytokines that contribute to the development of insulin resistance such as leptin tumor necrosis factor-a tnfa and interleukin-6 il-6 22 moreover diabetes and insulin resistance are associated with endothelial dysfunction and enhanced platelet aggregation and activation which predispose to the development of a hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic state 23 the low-grade chronic inflammation along with the hypercoagulable state in diabetes may promote the cytokine storm a complication of severe covid-19 which is characterized by excessive production of inflammatory cytokines il-6 il-10 and tnfa 24guo et al compared laboratory parameters between 37 diabetic and 137 non-diabetic covid-19 patients and found that absolute counts of neutrophils c-reactive protein crp d-dimers serum ferritin erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr il-6 and fibrinogen were significantly higher p  001 in diabetes compared to non-diabetes group 24 it is possible that higher inflammatory and hypercoagulable state may contribute to the development of cytokine storm and rapid deterioration of covid-19 in patients with diabetes 25other studies have also demonstrated enhanced inflammation response in diabetic patients with severe covid-19 compared with patients without diabetes yan et al compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes in 48 severe covid-19 patients with diabetes and 145 patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes in a retrospective observational study in china 26 white cell count neutrophil count crp il-2r il-6 il-8 d-dimer lactate dehydrogenase ldh as well as n-terminal pro-b- type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp were higher in diabetics patients with diabetes were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation been admitted to icu and die 26similarly in a multi-center study of 7337 cases of covid-19 in china patients with diabetes had a significantly higher incidence of lymphopenia higher leukocytes and neutrophil counts in peripheral blood higher inflammation markers like c-reactive protein and procalcitonin and increased d-dimers compared with non-diabetic patients 27 interestingly diabetic patients with well controlled glycemia experienced less severe inflammatory response than those with poorly controlled glycemia highlighting the importance of good glycemic control prior and during covid-19 27pulmonary dysfunction is another aspect that may contribute to worse outcomes of covid-19 in patients with diabetes several functional abnormalities in the respiratory tract have been reported in patients with diabetes such as reduced lung function low fev1 reduced forced vital capacity and peripheral airway obstruction the pathophysiology of diabetic lung is complex and includes hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia autonomic neuropathy oxidative stress micromacroangiopathy of alveolar capillaries and pulmonary arterioles glycosylation of tissue proteins collagen and elastin changes alteration of connective tissue surfactant dysfunction and malfunction of respiratory muscles 28obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes and most diabetics are overweight or obese obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for severe illness in covid-19 thus the presence of both obesity and diabetes further poses to poor prognosis 29 in a study of 383 chinese patients obese patients were at 340-fold odds of developing severe disease or 340 95  ci 140286 p  0007 compared with patients with normal weight even after adjusting for comorbidities and other risk factors 30 similarly obese patients had 3-fold greater likelihood or 300 95  ci 122738 of progressing to severe disease in a matched cohort study of 75 chinese patients after adjustment for clinical characteristics including the presence of diabetes 31 chronic inflammation in obesity impairs immune response moreover obesity is associated with decreased expiratory reserve volume functional capacity and respiratory system compliance predisposing to worse outcomes in a retrospective study obesity increased the risk for invasive ventilation in patients with covid-19 32 severe obesity bmi  35 kgm2 was also independently associated with mortality among 200 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in a tertiary hospital in new york 33the presence of multiple comorbidities correlates with greater disease severity and adverse outcomes on covid-19 infection 34the high incidence of diabetes in severe cases of covid-19 could reflect the frequent coexistence with other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and older age in a previous study concurrent cardiovascular disease increased the risk for infection-related death in patients with diabetes 35 in a retrospective study involving 153 covid-19 patients with diabetes compared with age and sex-matched patients without diabetes multivariable analyses showed that age 70 years hr 239 95  ci 103556 and hypertension hr 310 95  ci 114844 were independent risk factors for in-hospital death in patients with diabetes 36 another study identified older age as independent predictor of death among diabetic patients with covid-19 37sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 entry into target cells primarily the lung alveolar epithelial cells after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is an enzyme that degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 and angiotensin i to angiotensin 19 ace2 is also expressed in many other tissues such as the heart kidneys intestinal epithelium and pancreas 38 it has been suggested that aceis and arbs which are widely used as antihypertensives in diabetic patients result in the upregulation of ace2 thus possibly increasing the risk for and the severity of covid-19 infection 39experimental animal models have provided mixed results regarding the effects of aceis on ace2 levels while there are few studies in humans with inconclusive results 38 at present there is no clinical evidence supporting that the use of aceis or arbs aggravate the susceptibility or severity of covid-19 on the contrary arbs have shown a potentially protective pulmonary effect in experimental models 40 during sars-cov-2 infection alveolar ace2 appears to be downregulated resulting in decreased levels of protective angiotensin 17 41 in this context there is an ongoing study evaluating the effect of recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 rhace2 and another study with losartan as a treatment for patients with covid-19 therefore it can be speculated that having increased ace2 expression by raas inhibitors treatment may actually be beneficial in the course of sars-cov-2 infection 38according to several scientific societies including the european society of cardiology 42 european society of hypertension 43 the american heart association and the american college of cardiology 44 aceisarbs should not be withheld in stable patients who are at risk for or are infected with covid-19 until further data are available withdrawal of aceisarbs may result in clinical instability especially in high-risk patients such as those with prior myocardial infarction heart failure with impaired left ventricular function and proteinuric chronic kidney disease indeed findings from observational studies support current recommendations for treating hypertension during the covid-19 pandemic in a retrospective study from china there was no difference in severity complications and risk of death from covid-19 in patients on aceisarbs compared with those not treated with these medications 45 similarly in a case control study from italy the use of aceis or arbs did not influence the risk of covid-19 46an international expert panel has published practical recommendations for diabetes management in patients with covid-19 both in and out of the hospital setting 47 people with diabetes should follow general preventive measures including frequent hand hygiene and strict social distancing telemedicine should be encouraged when possible in order to avoid unnecessary routine clinical visits and prevent person-to-person transmission 47people with diabetes should intensify treatment and optimize glycemic control as better diabetes control is associated with improvement in cellular immunity 48 better control of hypertension and dyslipidemia should also be encouraged in order to achieve optimal metabolic control outpatient diabetics with mild covid-19 should follow sick day rules including frequent glucose monitoring adequate hydration monitor of ketones if on insulin therapy and frequent medical contact in order to identify possible clinical deterioration 49in cases of mild infection diabetes medications should be continued special attention should be paid on sodium-glucose transporter 2 sglt2 inhibitors because of the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration during acute illness however it is well established that sglt2i exert cardioprotective and renoprotective effects in patients with type-2 diabetes heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease thus it has been hypothesized that sglt2i may actually be beneficial in patients with covid-19 who frequently develop cardiovascular complications acute myocardial injury andor acute kidney injury a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 dapagliflozin in respiratory failure in patients with covid-19 dare-19 study is ongoing and will evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin in reducing disease progression complications and all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with mild-moderate covid-19 and type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease andor mild-moderate chronic kidney disease ckd 50 metformin may be stopped in those with acute illness and dehydration to minimize risk of lactic acidosis glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist glp-1ra therapy may be continued in non-critically ill patients however gastrointestinal side effects may predispose to volume depletion pioglitazone should be discontinued in critically ill patients 49 a concern has been raised as pioglitazone and liraglutide were associated with upregulation of ace2 in animal studies however as with aceisarbs there is currently absence of clinical evidence of harm in people affected by covid-19 51 dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 inhibitors are associated with low risk of hypoglycaemia and may be continued in non-critically ill patients dpp-4 is the receptor for mers 52 it has been hypothesized that dpp4 inhibitors might be a therapeutic strategy for preventing infection and decreasing the severity of covid-19 however there is currently no evidence that dpp4 serves as a receptor for sars-cov2 53 doses of other antihyperglycemic drugs such as sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be adjusted depending on blood glucose levels frequent self-monitoring of blood-glucose is necessary especially when insulin is used with careful adjustment of the insulin dose patients with type 1 diabetes should monitor ketone levels and be vigilant for the development of symptoms of dka 49indeed in a registry of patients with type 1 diabetes and covid-19 almost one third of the patients developed dka 54insulin is the treatment of choice in hospitalized covid-19 patients according to the american diabetes association guidelines basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill hospitalized patients continuous intravenous insulin infusion is preferred in critically ill patients in the icu a target glucose range of 140180 mgdl 78100 mmoll is recommended for both critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients 55 optimizing glycemic control in hospitalized patients requires multiple daily glucose measurements from health care providers the implementation of diabetes technology ie continuous glucose monitoring cgm can be helpful in minimizing staff exposure during the covid-19 pandemic as data can be remotely accessed and has been proven effective in maintaining blood glucose control 5657uks national diabetes inpatient covid response team has released guidelines for management of inpatient hyperglycemia in covid-19 patients with diabetes 58 it is emphasized that covid-19 increases the risk of diabetes emergencies such as dka and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state moreover markedly increased insulin resistance has been detected in the icu setting with patients requiring markedly elevated insulin drip rates up to 20 uh 58 guidance is also provided regarding the use of subcutaneous insulin for the treatment of dka when infusion pumps are not available noteworthy that all patients should be evaluated for diabetes at admission as there is evidence that sars-cov-2 predisposes to new onset diabetes 58 ace2 is widely expressed in several extrapulmonary tissues including the liver and the pancreatic islets infection of the beta cells by sars-cov-2 could result in impaired insulin secretion and contribute to the exacerbation of pre-existing or development of new diabetes in acutely ill patients with covid-19 25it is well established that inpatient hyperglycemia contributes to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality and that better glycemic control may improve clinical outcomes 59 improving glycemic control also correlates with better outcomes in patients with diabetes and covid-19 zhu et al showed that among 7337 confirmed covid-19 cases in china diabetics with better glucose control glycemic variability within 70180 mgdl 39100 mmoll had lower mortality rate than diabetics with poor control upper limit of glycemic variability 180 mgdl 100 mmoll 27 it is noteworthy that patients from the well-controlled group also had lower inflammatory and coagulation markers crp procalcitonin d-dimers required significantly less treatment antivirals antibiotics antifungals systemic corticosteroids immunoglobin and vasoactive drugs and had less need for oxygen supplementation as well as invasive and non-invasive ventilation 27 a retrospective study with 1122 patients in 88 us hospitals showed that patients with covid-19 and diabetes andor uncontrolled hyperglycaemia had a longer length of hospital stay and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes andor uncontrolled hyperglycaemia in a subset analysis of patients without evidence of diabetes prior to admission who developed hyperglycemia in hospital mortality was 7-fold greater thus raising the possibility that acute hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for mortality in covid-19 60 hyperglycemia at admission has also been associated with worse prognosis while optimal glycemic control during hospitalization is associated with a significant reduction of inflammatory cytokines procoagulative status and risk of severe disease and death in patients with covid-19 61people with diabetes are at increased risk of disease progression and developing covid-19 complications such as ards icu admission mechanical ventilation and death diabetic patients demonstrate severe inflammatory response and are more prone to develop cytokine storm syndrome optimal glycemic control is crucial in the covid-19 era and improves prognosis management of patients with diabetes and covid-19 is challenging prevention and treatment strategies are urgently required to decrease morbidity and mortality in this

 our economy except for limited sectors has come to a complete halt as we practice physical distancing to try to mitigate the effects of the pandemicin the 10 weeks since covid19 began to accelerate there has been a flurry of information from corners expected and unexpected to help us with this understanding rapid publication of peerreviewed data has defined the possible risk factors for covid19 its clinical course and its possible epidemiology in this unusual time of a public health emergency numerous nonpeerreviewed manuscripts have been uploaded to preprint servers and their unreviewed data and conclusions must be evaluated in this spiritnevertheless data both published and in preprint form point to a tantalizing hypothesis that covid19 infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sarscov2 viral particles in the lung epithelium the concentration of glycosylated angiotensinconverting enzyme receptor 2 ace2 in the lung epithelium and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the sarscov2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset which may be related to bothace2 appears to be the primary receptor for entry of sarscov2 into various epithelial tissues an envelope anchored spike protein allows entry of coronaviruses into host cells by binding to a host receptor and fusing viral and host membranes
2
 analysis of sarscov a betacoronavirus most similar to sarscov2 and responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars
3
 defined a receptorbinding domain rbd of the sarscov spike protein that specifically recognized ace2
4

susceptibility to sars appears to be primarily dependent on the affinity of the spike rbd to bind host ace2 in target tissues in the initial viral attachment step and differences in the affinity of the rbd for ace2 may determine the zoonotic host and epidemiology of spread
5
 protein crystal structure analysis of the sarscov rbd complexed with ace2 demonstrated that this differential binding affinity resides in a critical receptorbinding motif of the spike receptor protein and in particular the composition of amino acids 442 472 479 480 and 487 determine affinity for human ace2 as opposed to other hosts
5

predicted protein structural analysis of these critical five residues in the sarscov2 analogous to sarscov suggested an increased binding affinity to human ace2 by sarscov2
6
 a synthetic sarscov2 rbd was found in vitro to bind and enter cells transfected only with a human ace2 receptor and no other known coronavirus targets such as dpp4 the target of merscov
7
 therefore it is rational to assume that like sarscov sarscov2 uses the ace2 receptor on target tissues as its primary mechanism of entryrecent work with cryo electron microscopy of ace2 bound to a spike protein fragment of sarscov2
8
 suggests that the viral spike protein is a trimer with one of the trimer rbd sites exposed to bind ace2 additional structurefunction studies
9
 also appear to indicate that the viral spike s protein of sarscov2 is highly glycosylated the s protein is cleaved by proteases into two subunits s1 and s2 and the s1 subunit is further divided into sa and sb domains with the sb domain predicted to bind to human ace2 the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion of the virusace2 complex with the cell membrane and is highly glycosylated at evolutionarily conserved sites
9

it is tempting to speculate that alterations in glycosylation of both the spike protein as well as ace2 can modulate viral binding it is also tempting to speculate that alterations in the highly glycosylated and evolutionarily conserved viral fusion subunit could modulate s proteinace2 complex fusion with the cell membrane and potentially attenuate human to human transmissionthe importance of ace2 binding by sarscov2 in covid19 is underscored by the observation that anosmia and dysgeusia have recently been observed in patients with covid19
10
 and that ace2 expression has recently been found to be high in the oropharynx and tongue
11

binding of ace2 by sarscov2 in covid19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia and not just a history of diabetes mellitus may be important in the pathogenesis of the diseasea known history of diabetes dm and ambient hyperglycemia were found to be independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in sars
12
 in a followup analysis of 135 patients high fasting plasma glucose fpg was an independent predictor of sars mortality
13
 diabetes was found in 74 of a cohort of hospitalized covid19 patients and appeared to be a risk factor for severity of disease
14
 a history of diabetes was associated with 225 of covid19 intensive care unit icu admissions vs 59 of nonicu admissions in one case series
15
 and another recent icu case series reported 14 of 24 58 with a history of diabetes
16
 mortality of covid19 in patients with diabetes was found to be 76 vs 09 in patients with no comorbidities
17

a possible explanation for a link between hyperglycemia and ace2 levels in the severity of covid19 disease could be explained by several clinical observations in sars and preclinical observations in the nod diabetic mouse as noted above potential changes in glycosylation of the ace2 as well as glycosylation of the viral spike protein both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia may alter both the binding of the viral spike protein to ace2 and the degree of the immune response to the virusin a subset of 39 patients who had no prior diabetes received no steroid treatment during hospitalization and who survived sars fpg levels during hospitalization were found to decrease before discharge
13
 twenty of these 39 51 patients had diabetes during hospitalization
13
 and at 3 years of followup only 2 of 39 5 did autopsy examination of an unrelated individual revealed high levels of ace2 expression in the alveolar tissue of the lung the islet cells of the pancreas the heart and the kidney this suggested a mechanism of transient hyperglycemia induced by a transient inflammation of the islet cells of the pancreas by sarscov through binding of sarscov to the ace2 present on islet cells resulting in a transient insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which resolved with resolution of disease
13

in a study of nod diabetic mice ace2 protein levels in the lung were putatively elevated when compared to control mice and returned to the control level when insulin was administered
18
 by reducing levels of glycosylated ace2 target in the target lung tissue by glycemic control this could possibly reduce the number of glycosylated viral binding sites in the lung and hence possibly ameliorate some of the inflammation and symptoms of covid19 disease this also suggests a possible paracrine loop hypothesis for covid19 infection where the virus infects the pancreas and lung leading to hyperglycemia and upregulation of glycosylated ace2 in the lung and further virus binding and inflammation poor glycemic control could therefore make the disease more severe in a case series of 138 covid19 patients glucocorticoid therapy was used in 449 of nonicu patients and 722 of icu patients
15
 and presumably this glucocorticoid use made hyperglycemia and possibly clinical symptoms more severe a recent review of glucocorticoids in viral diseases recommended against use in covid19 pneumonia and suggested that it could cause harm
19

it is interesting to note that as this article was going to press that another group has expressed a similar hypothesis
20

potentially high and aberrantly glycosylated ace2 in the lung nasal airways tongue and oropharynx in uncontrolled hyperglycemia could also serve as increased sarscov2 viral binding sites thus leading to a higher propensity to covid19 infection and a higher disease severityinterestingly high ace2 has a protective effect in various organs
21
 ace2 gene expression is increased by estrogen in a mouse model 
22
 a potential protective factor for sarscov2 infection and pathogenicity as men are more likely than women to both acquire covid19 and have more severe disease recent survey studies found that ace2 gene expression was higher in tissues of women and in younger adults an inverse correlation to disease severity
23
 a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that gene expression experiments cannot measure posttranslational modifications such as protein glycosylation in the nod diabetic mouse model ace2 activity in the lung did not rise and then fall with insulin administration but the amount of ace2 protein apparently did
18
 this is consistent with a rise in glycosylated ace2 as opposed to total ace2 since antibody binding to proteins as measured by western blot analysis could be affected by glycosylation
24
 therefore it is likely that it is the amount of glycosylated ace2 receptor and not simply the amount of ace2 alone that is responsible for virus binding and fusionif true this argues for better glycemic control in patients with prediabetes and diabetes as a potential mechanism to slow covid19 spread and reduce the severity of symptoms additionally since 38 of the american population without a history of diabetes or prediabetes has a hemoglobin a1c over 61 in random sampling
25
 use of high a1c as a risk stratification for covid19 could have meritclinical information about the timing of the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in sars and covid19 is also informative in a series of 75 patients with sars
26
 median time to oxygen desaturation occurred around day 4 after the onset of symptoms median time to peak viral load occurred around day 10 and median time to peak ards requiring intubation occurred around day 10 to 12 in a series of 138 covid19 patients
15
 median time to dyspnea from the onset of symptoms was 5 days to hospital admission was 7 days and to ards 8 days in a series of 24 covid19 patients admitted to icus in the seattle area the median time to hospital admission was 7 days from the onset of symptoms another case series from wuhan suggests a median time from symptom onset to development of computed tomography ct scan changes consistent with covid19 pneumonia to be a median of 5 days
14
 it appears that both sars and covid19 have a similar clinical course of infection symptom onset dyspnea and oxygen desaturation at approximately day 5 after symptoms in a fraction of symptomatic patients followed by a worsening of disease to ards requiring intubation at day 7 to 10 after symptoms in a smaller fraction of dyspneic patientsthis appears to be coincident with a peak in viral load as measured in nasopharyngeal swabs at day 10 after symptom onset in sars
26
 the timing of the ards in sars also corresponded to the timing of immunoglobulin g igg seroconversion
26
 additionally the neutralizing antibody nab response to the sarscov spike protein in patients who died of sars occurred earlier in the course of the disease 147 days after symptom onset vs those who survived 20 days and the nab antibody titer was higher in those who died of sars than in those survived
27
 notably viral load in covid19 in severe cases appears to remain high 10 days after symptom onset
28
 and it is tempting to hypothesize that a similar mechanism applies to sarscov2the study of sarslike coronaviruses in animal models has been of necessity difficult in large part due to concerns in preventing a pandemic similar to the one we are currently experiencing sars experiments require a biosafety level 3 laboratory and experiments where recombinant coronavirus constructs were produced by insertion of various novel spike protein rbd coding sequences into benign or nontransmissible coronaviruses were specifically banned by the national institutes of health in 2014
29

however experimental information exists on sars infection and immune response from a chinese macaque animal model
30
 in this model vaccination with a modified vaccina virus containing the fulllength sarscov spike protein followed by infection with sarscov induced varying degrees of diffuse alveolar damage in the majority of the experimental animals 7 days after infection adoptive transfer of serum from macaques vaccinated with the sarscov spike protein but not infected with sarscov was performed and this serum induced diffuse alveolar damage at rates greater than control serum in sarscovinfected macaques indicating that the spike protein neutralizing antibodies were amplifying virus damage by sarscov in the lung even at low doses of serum high doses of serum still caused alveolar damage even if they reduced sarscov viral titers and the damage appeared to be restricted to acutely infected animals the action of the serum in inducing this damage also appeared to be due to driving of pulmonary macrophages excessively to a proinflammatory m1 polarized state possibly through involvement of the glycosylated fc gamma receptor serum from deceased sars patients in this study also induced this proinflammatory m1 polarization as wellthe acute onset of lung inflammation in sars resulting in ards appears to be tightly associated with monocytemacrophage polarization and function
31
 during acute infection macrophages display a classically activated inflammatory m1 phenotype and express cytokines such as interleukin6 il6 high il6 levels were associated with increased mortality in a series of 191 hospitalized patients with covid19
16

it is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in covid19 as in sars where an overactive macrophage m1 inflammatory response as neutralizing antibodies to the sarscov2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10 results in ards in susceptible patients it is also allows consideration of agents which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease in particular those that blunt but do not completely abrogate m2 to m1 balance in macrophage polarization as well as viral load which in sars appears to be temporally related to the onset of ardsit is of interest that in a mouse model of asthma macrophage m2 polarization is increased by estrogen
32
 additionally estrogen also accelerates acquisition of an m2 phenotype in a monocyte cell culture model
33
 differences in m1 to m2 polarization may perhaps explain the partial protective effect of female sex in the pathogenesis of covid19it is a tribute to the ingenuity and effort of the medical and scientific community that we currently have multiple agents in clinical trials to help treat covid19 all of which have a rational basis however for an agent to have an effect in blunting the medical complications of a widespread pandemic where hundreds of thousands of infected patients are at risk of fatal progression of disease this agent needs to be cheap relatively nontoxic and rapidly scalable only one of the agents being considered at this point meets these criteriahydroxychloroquine has been used of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions for nearly 70 years it has also been used as malaria prophylaxis and treatment for nearly 50 years it is extremely safe and has been used widely in underdeveloped countries for these conditions in children and in pregnant women with little to no monitoring while there are potential concerns for rare drug interactions with other agents that prolong the qt interval and there are concerns with retinopathy with long term use neither of these uncommon complications should be clinically significant if appropriate caution an electrocardiogram ekg before therapy is employed
34

there is a possible rational basis for the development of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid19 in clinical trials of treatment and prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine inhibits sarscov2 in vitro at concentrations achievable in human lung tissue
35
 chloroquine a related compound inhibits sarscov replication and spread in cell culture possibly through reducing glycosylation of the ace2 receptor
36
 interestingly computer simulations suggest that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are predicted to bind to the active site of the enzyme udpnacetylglucosamine 2epimerase which catalyzes the rate determining step in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway
37
 and thus there is a rational basis to assume hydroxychloroquine can interfere in terminal glycosylation of proteins in the golgi apparatusin a small unrandomized clinical cohort of 80 patients the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been shown to rapidly reduce viral load in covid19 patients and ameliorate clinical symptoms in the majority of patients
38
 in another small randomized unpublished study of 62 covid19 patients undertaken after the observation that none of a cohort 80 lupus patients in wuhan on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy developed covid19 infection 62 patients with mild covid19 symptoms and signs of covid19 pneumonia on ct scan were randomized to 200mg of hydroxychloroquine orally twice daily for 5 days and usual care or usual care alone
39
 in the hydroxychloroquine arm of this study 806 of subjects had improvement of covid19 pneumonia findings on ct scan vs 508 of controls after 5 days of therapy p0476 and 0 of patients on hydroxychloroquine progressed to severe disease vs 129 of control patients pnot donehydroxychloroquine also can act as an oral hypoglycemic agent as patients with diabetes taking hydroxychloroquine for rheumatologic diseases had a significant reduction in hemoglobin a1c when compared to methotrexate
40
 and thus can serve to reduce hyperglycemia a possible covid19 risk factor for disease severitywhile studies are mixed on this topic and the balance of m1 to m2 macrophage polarization may differ depending on the local microenvironment hydroxychloroquine has been shown in at least one study to block the polarization of macrophages to an m1 inflammatory subtype
41
 and it is predicted to interfere with glycosylation of a number of proteins involved in the humoral immune response possibly including the macrophage fcr gamma igg receptor and other immunomodulatory proteins potentially through inhibition of udpnacetylglucosamine 2epimerase in combination with potential other immunomodulatory effects this could possibly blunt the progression of covid19 pneumonia all to way up to ards where a potential overconversion to an inflammatory m1 macrophage subtype occurs in response to a postulated brisk humoral immune response to the sarscov2 spike protein around day 8 to 10 after symptom onsetwhile we await larger randomized studies and more analysis of patient subtypes to determine who if anyone will benefit from hydroxychloroquine in the context of this theoretical framework for covid19 infection the results to date are supportive although much caution should be used in interpretation of these early small clinical trialsregardless of the results of larger clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine in covid19 it is hoped that the above analysis can provide a testable theoretical framework to allow for advances in our understanding and control of this deadly viral epidemicthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsin december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was first observed in wuhan china 1 on feb 11 2020 the world health organization who officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by feb 19 2020 a total of 74 283 cases with covid-19 in china have been reported with 2009 27 death 2 although most patients with covid-19 have mild symptoms and good prognosis 3 accumulating evidence have indicated a high mortality of the covid-19 patients 11 1 4 resembling that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov infection 5 a few patients rapidly developed severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome cardiac injury or multiple organ failure and died 4 however data on the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 are limited and the underlying mechanism is not clear yet therefore early identification of the severity of covid-19 is very important for public healthrecently the triglyceride-glucose tyg index a product of triglycerides and glucose is widely used as a reliable surrogate marker of insulin resistance ir 6 studies have shown that the tyg index is associated with an increased risk of diabetes 7 hypertension 8 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 9 and might predict the development of cardiovascular events 10 patients with cardiometabolic disorders may be more susceptible to infection of covid-19 and becoming severe case partly due to their abnormal metabolism and systemic inflammation state thus these patients might have a higher risk of poor outcome in this sense studies that evaluate the relationship between tyg index with the severity and mortality of covid-19 are urgently neededin this study we investigated patients with confirmed covid-19 who were admitted to wuhan tongji hospital the purpose of this study was to explore the association of tyg index levels with the clinical outcomes of patients with covid-19 and to provide ideas for improving covid-19 prognosisthis study retrospectively analysed confirmed covid-19 from jan 12 2020 to feb 13 2020 at tongji hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan china all patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed as covid-19 according to who interim guidance 11 patients with missing data on clinical characteristics were excluded considering the complexity of the disease as well as the uncertainty of the course of treatment 151 patients which had completed medical records and follow up data were

hypertension and the use of antihypertensive drugs other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease chronic kidney disease chronic pulmonary disease and chronic liver disease were diagnosed according to self-reported medical historyseverity of the disease was staged according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 trial sixth edition published by national health commission of china on february 18 2020 severe case was defined as including one criterion as follow 1 respiratory rate  30min 2 oxygen saturation  93 3 pao2fio2 4 patients developed either with shock or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or combined with the other organ failure admission to intensive care unit icuwe presented continuous variables as mean  standard deviation sd for normally distributed data or median interquartile range iqr for data with skew distribution and categorical variables as frequencies percentage   we assessed differences between mild and severe cases using two-sample t test or mannwhitney u test depending on parametric or nonparametric data for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables comparisons among tyg index groups were assessed by the analysis of variance anova or kruskalwallis test univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations between tyg index and the severity and mortality of covid-19 the associations of tyg index with severity of covid-19 in subgroups classified by age  60 vs  60 years sex male vs female and medical history of chronic disease presence vs absence including diabetes mellitus and hypertension were also studied using logistic regression analysis we used spss software version 190 spss inc chicago il usa for all analyses with statistically significant for p  005a total of 151 admitted hospital patients were included in our study with a mean age of 595  159 years old 78 517 of patients were males regarding the history of chronic diseases 397 had hypertension 258 had diabetes 106 had cardiovascular disease 46 had cerebrovascular disease 73 had chronic kidney disease 13 had chronic pulmonary disease and 20 had chronic liver disease the most prevalent symptoms were fever 887 cough 688 and fatigue 563 in this population 62 411 patients were severe cases while 33 220 patients died in hospital the baseline characteristics of patients according to severity were shown in table 1 severe patients were older more males and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes compared with mild patients the prevalence of dyspnea anorexia and fatigue of the severe group were higher than that of the mild group all p  005 moreover severe patients had significantly higher value of respiratory rate systemic blood pressure sbp and mortality andor more likely to receive auxiliary ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation all p  005 but there was no markedly difference for other parameterslaboratory findings of patients according to the severity were shown in table 2 for blood routine examination severe patients had obviously higher values of white blood cell wbc count and neutrophil count neu but notably lower levels of lymphocytes count than mild patients p  005 regarding blood biochemical indicators severe group had higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase ast lactate dehydrogenase ldh creatinine uric acid ua crp and fpg compared with mild group p  005 in addition the levels of ferritin and tnf were also elevated in severe ones p  005 notably tyg index which calculated by triglycerides and glucose was markedly higher in severe cases than in mild ones p  005table 3 showed the baseline characteristics among covid-19 patients divided according to tyg

 005 most importantly patients with increasing level of tyg index had a higher incidence of severe covid-19 case and death p  0008 and 001 respectively as shown in fig 1additionally the association between tyg index and the severity of covid-19 were further confirmed by logistic regression table 4 after adjustment for age sex sbp and hba1c the tyg index was independently associated with the severity of covid-19 patients with an odds ratio or of 29 95 confidence interval ci 12663 however no significant association was observed after further adjusting for crp and tnf or 23 95 ci 0683next we studied correlations between tyg with crp and tnf by using pearson correlation analysis we observed that after controlling for age sex hba1c and sbp tyg levels positively correlated with both crp r  0286 p  0003 and tnf r  042 p  00001we further assessed the effect of tyg index in particular subsets of patients with covid-19 table 4 similar results were observed in subgroups analysis after adjustment for age sex sbp and hba1c the positively association between tyg index and the severity was observed in subgroups of men women age  60 and patients with diabetes or 57 95 ci 17192 or 33 95 ci 1570 or 30 95 ci 1273 or 68 95 ci 13348 however the adjusted association was not statistically significant observed after adding crp and tnf in model 3 or 32 95 ci 04227 or 26 95 ci 0890 or 54 95 ci 510306 or 60 95 ci 07517 additionally the associations were not significant in patients with age  60 years or without diabetes or hypertensionmoreover the results showed the tyg index level was significantly higher in the death group survivor vs deceased 88  06 vs 93  07 p  0001 we used a logistic regression model to evaluate the association of tyg index with the mortality of covid-19 and found that the tyg index was a risk factor for increased mortality of covid-19 patients or 29 95 ci 1267 after adjustment for age sex sbp and hba1c table 5 notably the association was not statistically significant observed after additionally adjustment for crp and tnf or 28 95 ci 07113finally we performed the receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis to test the ability of tyg to predict the severity and mortality of covid-19 the optimal cut-off value of tyg was derived from the point with the maximum youden index the area under the roc curve auroc of tyg for predicting severe covid-19 patients was 0664 95 ci 05760751 p  0001 the optimal cut-off point of tyg was 85 with a sensitivity of 871 and specificity of 382 moreover the auroc of tyg for predicting the mortality of covid-19 was 0687 95ci 05840790 p  0001 the optimal cut-off point of tyg was 96 yielding sensitivity and specificity of 394 and 923 respectivelyepidemiological evidence have shown a high mortality and morbidity of diabetic patients who develop covid-19 4 our data also observed a high prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 patients notably we found that the tyg index a reliable surrogate marker of ir were predictive of severe cases and mortality of covid-19 patients previous studies have shown that the tyg index may predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus 12 and metabolic syndrome 13 it has been reported that the tyg index is positively associated with the higher prevalence of subclinical coronary artery disease cad 14 symptomatic cad and metabolic and behavioral risk factors 15 and arterial stiffness and nephric microvascular damage 16 moreover higher tyg index correlated with increased risk of main adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events macce in acute st-elevation myocardial infarction stemi patients and the tyg index might be a valuable predictor of clinical outcomes in stemi patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 17 moreover an elevated tyg index was significantly associated with a higher risk of arterial stiffness and nephric microvascular damage the positive association of tyg index with increased risk of developing severe cases and the risk of mortality in confirmed covid-19 patients could be attributed to the roles of ir in metabolic disorder an altered inflammation profile and cardiovascular disease risk factors these findings support the significance of tyg index as a valuable predictor of poorer outcomes for covid-19 patients and remind physicians that more intensive attention should be paid to patients with high level of tyg indexthe virus of covid-19 was classified as beta-coronavirus and had highly pathogenicity similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that could cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans 1820 yet the fundamental pathophysiology of covid-19 remains unknown previous studies have shown that increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in serum eg il1b il6 il12 ifn il10 and tnf were induced in patients with sars 21 and mers 22 considering the large amount of cytokines induced by sars-cov and mers-cov a cytokine storm in the body might play a crucial role in pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage of patients with covid-19 in early studies covid-19 was also reported to induce increased secretion of t-helper-2 th2 cytokines eg il4 and il10 that suppress inflammation 4 we noted that severe patients of covid-19 had high amounts of inflammatory indicators ferritin and tnf in severe patients than mild ones suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severityconsistent with previous reported older patients were more susceptible to covid-19 and 70 of infected patients were men 1 in the present study similar results were observed in age yet there is no difference in the prevalence of male or female in total patients with covid-19 notably the present study also emphasized a greater number of men among severe cases compared with mild cases these findings suggest that older male patients was more likely to have a worse prognosis in addition to the elderly and males we found that patients with a history of diabetes and hypertension are at increased risk of severe covid-19 and mortality in agreement with previous studies 4 23 nevertheless we observed a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension than that reported in the above study the high prevalence of comorbid conditions may be expected for tongji hospital being the designated hospital for severe caseswe found tyg index was closely associated with the mortality of covid-19 which may be useful to predict the poor outcome for the infected patients although we attempted to adjust for many confounders it is difficult to assess the independently cause of death among the 33 dead cases the causes of death may be respiratory failure heart failure inflammation storm sepsis disseminated intravascular coagulation multiple organ failure acute kidney injury malignant arrhythmia diabetic ketoacidosis even sudden death and other uncertain events taken together it is not easy to identify the relationship between tyg index and any cause of death in the worldthis study has several strengths first the covid-19 was first observed in wuhan china a large number of patients are suffering with covid-19 in this city which provided us an opportunity to evaluate the epidemic affair second we benefited from obtaining accurate and thorough clinical data of patients in tongji hospital which is a designated hospital responsible for the treatments for moderate-severe covid-19 patients in wuhan third all authors are first line doctors who could directly observe participantsseveral limitations in this study should also be addressed first considering the complexity of the disease as well as the limited information on the course of disease the number of samples is relatively small second compared with published paper the percentage of severe cases was high in our study it may be explained by that tongji hospital is the designated hospital for moderate-severe cases third most people were hospitalized for treatment of pneumonia resulting that metabolic disorders were easily overlooked thus we could not observe the association of metabolic control with the prognosis of covid-19 fourth the tyg index which predicted the death of covid-19 in this study might be affected by the change of triglycerides and glucose levels other factors such as inflammation should also be taken into consideration when predicting the death of a patientin summary our study illustrated that the tyg index was notably high in severe and dead patients of covid-19 moreover the study unveiled that tyg index was an independent predictor of an increased risk of poor outcome in patients with covid-19 these findings also highlighted the high risk of severe condition and death among patients with metabolic disorders despite this understanding the mechanisms underlying the interaction of the tyg index and covid-19 will allow for drug development aimed at treatment andor preventing severe condition
the coronavirus disease covid-19 is a global pandemic and significantly impacts individuals living with diabetes in china wu and mcgoogan 1 reported that people living with diabetes who contracted the virus had a more than triple mortality rate of 7 in comparison to 2 in those without diabetes these figures align with previous global pandemics which were also associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes 2 during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic canadians living with diabetes had triple the risk of hospitalization and quadruple the risk of intensive care unit admissions 3 the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic also resulted in increased hospitalization and disease severity for people with diabetes 45 as global pandemics continue to occur and the prevalence of diabetes increases 6 the diabetes community will be increasingly confronted with ongoing public health challenges 7the world health organization has warned that older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes are at higher risk of covid-19 exposure complications and death 8 since the majority of the diabetes population are older 9 and have multiple comorbidities of obesity emphysema hypertension and heart failure 1011 they are at greater risk of viral infection although data on covid-19 presentation has yet to support an increased risk of viral contraction in people living with diabetes 1213 evidence suggests that they may have worse outcomes should they contract the virus 1314poor glycemic control is a significant contributor to covid-19 severity hyperglycemic events can lead to diabetes ketoacidosis which is a life-threatening condition that interferes with the immune response to mitigate sepsis and recovery 15 coronaviruses have also been shown to bind to their target cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 fang et al 16 proposed that the expression of ace2 is substantially increased in people managing their diabetes with ace inhibitors and antihyperglycemic angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers 17 as such these individuals may be at an increased risk of developing severe and fatal covid-19 to maintain adequate glycemic control people living with diabetes are normally encouraged to eat well exercise and maintain good mental health 18-20 however efforts to minimize the risk of exposure to covid-19 have required social distancing and quarantine practices that may exacerbate insulin sensitivity through lower levels of physical activity abrupt changes in social routine poor dietary diversity and diabetes distress 21-24guidelines authored by prominent diabetes societies encourage the use of insulin as the preferred treatment during the global pandemic 2526 however the impact of covid-19 on the global economy has compromised insulin production and access 27 for people who are insulin-dependent the risk of an insulin shortage or delayed delivery is deadly 28 health professionals are recommending people to have a 30-day supply of diabetes medication and supplies for their medical devices 29 this advice may prove difficult to heed for the growing population of people in both urban 108 and rural 72 settings who experience socioeconomic disparities specifically lower income as they may not be able to afford adhering to such guidelines 133031 in addition the shortage of commercial antibacterial products may impede sterilization techniques for insulin injections and blood glucose monitoring and promote infection 32 significant decreases in traditional in-person clinic availability will require people to adopt and adjust to receiving digital diabetes care 33in response to social distancing guidance outpatient diabetes clinics and family medicine practices have greatly curtailed their services to only the most urgent cases 34 even as restrictions are expected to ease over time there will be continued caution in visiting clinics in light of these circumstances the use of previously restricted forms of communication between providers and their patients have been allowed most forms of audio video or texting technology have been allowed by jurisdictions through not only relaxing privacy and security requirements but also reimbursing providers for these services even telephone calls have become an accepted modality for conducting a clinical visit allowing those without sophisticated consumer devices like smartphones to access services 35-37for those living with diabetes this is an opportunity to be able to access care with greater convenience while not having to expose themselves to infection in an in-person clinic if the use of virtual visits continues after the pandemic easesas they are expected to 38it opens up a great opportunity to provide more timely access to not only physician care but services that are often scarce for those living with diabetes 39 with physical distances no longer a factor virtualizing the care provided by diabetes educators dieticians and specialized mental health professionals could improve access further than what was previously possible with in-person encounters 40 these successes can only be realized if broader digital health inequities of access and literacy are addressed within the diabetes community 41perhaps more compelling than improving access to health services through virtual care digital health apps can also create greater agency in self-care a series of studies in recent years have demonstrated that diabetes smartphone apps with the ability to capture diabetes data and other self-reported factors can produce clinically significant improvement in glycemic control for both those living with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes 404243 these outcomes were achieved without the benefit of a provider facilitating care through the app additional studies have since shown that outcomes can be further enhanced with the addition of virtual care and the active use of diabetes data sharing to enhance diabetes coaching and guidance 4445despite the positive enablers for remote diabetes care the ability to share diabetes device data back to the clinic remains a challenge 46 as it stands the current landscape of diabetes device data interoperability is a patchwork of proprietary technologies open source tools and restrictive electronic health record ehr policies in the end it requires an unnecessarily high level of technical sophistication on the clinics part and on those living with diabetes to routinely use their diabetes device data in clinic visits virtual or otherwise 47-49 this technical burden will simply continue to hamper efforts to facilitate comprehensive virtual care it continues to be a challenge to convince manufacturers of diabetes devices and ehr vendors to create truly interoperable systems to ease the burden on the diabetes communities 40 it is hoped that the pandemic further reveals the flaws of the industrys business tactics to maintain exclusivity and their slow response in addressing the needs of the diabetes communityas the world comes together to fight the covid-19 pandemic close collaboration among the global diabetes community is critical to understand and manage the sustained impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes figure 1 presents a summary of the challenges of covid-19 for people living with diabetes and the opportunities of diabetes digital health to support them in this time of need contribution and access to trusted diabetes resources that can communicate actionable insights on the status of covid-19 are needed to support the community through these challenging times 121350-55
